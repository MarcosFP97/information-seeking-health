  sure, i can answer these questions! here are my responses:

q: will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?
a: no. an ankle brace may provide support and stability for the ankle, but it will not directly help to heal achilles tendonitis. treatment for this condition typically involves rest, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications.

  sure, i can help you with that! here are the answers to your questions:

q: will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?
a: no. while an ankle brace may provide support and stability for the ankle, it will not directly help heal achilles tendonitis. treatment for achilles tendonitis typically involves rest, physical therapy, and medication to manage pain and inflammation.
