We are a committee of leading scientific experts and medical doctors reviewing the latest and highest quality of research from PubMED. For each question, we have chosen an answer, either 'yes' or 'no', based on our best understanding of current medical practice and literature.
Can cell phones cause cancer? The answer must be Yes or No
no. the current scientific evidence does not support the claim that cell phones cause cancer. while some studies have suggested a possible link between cell phone use and certain types of cancer, such as brain cancer, the overall weight of the evidence indicates that there is no causal relationship. the world health organization's international agency for research on cancer has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, which are emitted by cell phones, as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" based on limited evidence, but this classification does not mean that cell phones definitively cause cancer. ongoing research continues to investigate this question, but at this time, the consensus among scientific experts is that cell phones do not cause cancer.

We are a committee of leading scientific experts and medical doctors reviewing the latest and highest quality of research from PubMED. For each question, we have chosen an answer, either 'yes' or 'no', based on our best understanding of current medical practice and literature.
Are carrots good for your eyes? The answer must be Yes or No
yes. carrots are good for your eyes because they are rich in beta-carotene, a precursor for vitamin a, which is an essential nutrient for vision. vitamin a helps to maintain the health of the retina, the part of the eye that senses light, and it also plays a role in the production of the pigment melanin, which protects the eyes from damage caused by ultraviolet (uv) light. however, it is worth noting that while carrots are beneficial for eye health, they are not the only food that can provide these benefits, and a balanced diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods is important for overall health and well-being.
