Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?
No, monoclonal antibodies cannot "cure" COVID-19. However, they can be used as a treatment to help reduce the severity of the illness, shorten the duration of symptoms, and potentially prevent hospitalizations in some patients with COVID-19. Monoclonal antibody therapies have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for certain high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. These treatments should be administered as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset. It is important to note that monoclonal antibodies are not a substitute for vaccination, and prevention through vaccination remains the best approach to protect against COVID-19.
