Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The reason why cognitive function significantly improved for a short period after folate supplementation remains unclear. One possibility was mentioned above, folic acid supplementation and lower Hcy levels can improve MS activity and D4 dopamine receptor-mediated PLM, which were proposed to play a central role in attention and cognition [46]. Another possibility is that folate deficiency is one of the risk factors for depression [27]. Mood improvement may be beneficial for cognitive function. Other possibilities are as follows: practice effects or placebo effects. Another possibility is that because this study was performed at a dementia clinic, the doctor and health care providers provided other forms of care to stimulate brain function, including better daily living, such as a regular lifestyle, regular meals, reading newspapers and participating in social activities, which may have influenced the improvement in the MMSE score."

Evidence:"Thus, it is possible that the rubber-based adhesive or other components of an adhesive not found on our study tape are required for effective treatment of warts. This study had several limitations. First, many patients had difficulty keeping the pads in place despite the use of additional securing dressings. It can be assumed, therefore, that some warts were likely uncovered for periods of time. If large pieces of duct tape were used (as would be typical in clinical practice) rather than cut pads (such as were used as in our study), compliance with treatment would likely improve. Second, because the type of adhesive in the transparent duct tape used in this study differs from that of standard silver duct tape, it is possible that the adhesive (or some other component) of standard silver duct tape may be effective for the treatment of warts."

Evidence:"Yes, milk can reduce blood pressure, see how. Too much pressure
Blood pressure can rise and fall during the day, but when it stays high over time, it is diagnosed as hypertension. This is a condition in which blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than what is considered normal, requiring the heart to work too hard. If it’s not brought under control, hypertension can lead to heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. Since hypertension often has no symptoms, it’s vital to have your blood pressure checked regularly. With proper management, you can cut your risk of stroke by 40 percent and your risk of heart attack by 25 percent."

Treating COVID-19
Sasson and her collaborators were inspired to launch the trial after discovering that patients with COVID-19 were at significantly greater risk of needing a ventilator if their blood contained high levels of interleukin-13, a driver of inflammation in the body. Dupilumab, sold under the brand name Dupixent, works by blocking the effects of IL-13. The federal Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab in 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema (an itchy skin condition also known as atopic dermatitis). Dupilumab is now also used to treat patients with asthma and chronic sinus inflammation. To see if dupilumab could improve the body’s immune response to COVID-19, Sasson and her collaborators enrolled 40 patients with moderate to severe cases in a clinical trial."

Evidence:"How aromatherapy can help with rheumatismWhile aromatherapy cannot cure osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis there are many essential oils and carrier oils that can help slow down its progress by preparing the body for exercise and aiding recovery from exercise, easing anxiety and promoting relaxation, supporting detoxification and last but not least reducing pain and inflammation. We discuss the most common methods of application and suitable essential oils below.Aromatherapy massageWhen a child falls over, they are often told to ‘rub it better’, and this is something that we sometimes do as adults. For some reason, this action seems to reduce the pain, and this is possibly because our nerve pathways are being stimulated to interrupt the pain signal to the brain, sometimes referred to as the pain gate mechanism. The same theory may be applied to aromatherapy massage in which the affected area is ‘rubbed’ using massage techniques, such as gentle effleurage and petrissage. However, it is important to note that pain indicates damage, so massaging inflamed sites should be done with care. Massage may provide short-term relief from pain because there is also an increase of endorphins released into the blood-stream as a result of the stimulation and these hormones are natural pain killers."

But the mucus that triggers coughing and needs to be dislodged through inhalation is found in the bronchi and lungs.As Dr Rohland the paediatrician also repeatedly explains to parents and his patients: “Inhaling steam is considered a home remedy for colds and coughs. But I recommend using a nebuliser for inhalation because this is the only effective method of inhalation. Using an inhalation device with a jet or membrane nebuliser is the only way to ensure that the fluid being inhaled is vaporised into tiny particles. Only very fine nebulised particles can get into the bronchi and bronchioles and have an effect. This is not a given when inhaling hot water vapour.”   Effective inhalation of saline solution with nebulisers for respiratory distress, wheezing upon exhalation and rales It is not unusual for children in the first three years of life to experience so-called obstructive bronchitis caused by viruses."

Copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps fail to help rheumatoid arthritis, says York research
Posted on 16 September 2013
Copper bracelets and magnet wrist straps have no real effect on pain, swelling, or disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis, according to new findings from a study conducted at the University of York. In the first randomised controlled trial to study the effects of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps on rheumatoid arthritis, 70 patients with active symptoms each wore four different devices over a five-month period, reporting on their pain, disability, and medication use throughout the study. Participants also provided blood samples, after wearing each device for five weeks, in order to monitor changes in inflammation. What these findings do tell us is that people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness
Dr Stewart Richmond
The research published in PLOS ONE, show that both the standard magnetic wrist strap and the copper bracelet provided no meaningful therapeutic effects beyond those of a placebo, which was not magnetic and did not contain copper. Dr Stewart Richmond, a Research Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study, said: “It’s a shame that these devices don’t seem to have any genuine benefit. They’re so simple and generally safe to use."
Question:Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis? The answer must be yes or no.

    Shea Butter Vs. Cocoa Butter
  The inability of shea butter and cocoa butter to treat this form of scarring doesn't mean either ingredient isn't sometimes beneficial. While your physician can recommend creams, the Cleveland Clinic doesn't actually specifically recommend shea or cocoa butter to reduce or prevent the appearance of stretch marks. In fact, ointments and creams that assert to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy are of little value, reports the National Institutes of Health. A cream made with shea butter or cocoa butter could be used to soften the skin and help prevent stretch marks as a result of weight gain, as seen in pregnancy. Advertisement
    Tretinoin Treatments
  The only topical agent known to improve stretch marks is tretinoin, according to the CNN Health website. This prescription retinoid is commonly used to treat acne but can also encourage an increase in the production of collagen as well as promote the cellular turnover of epidermal cells."

Evidence:"Authors' conclusions: 
Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression."

Evidence:"I have found them clinically useful for BPD. In the 2003 study the author cited, Zanarini et al1 concluded “E-EPA [ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid] is a nutriceutical agent that is both well tolerated and may be efficacious for the treatment of moderately disturbed women with borderline personality disorder. Ninety percent of those taking this compound were able to complete the entire 8-week trial and reported no clinically relevant side effects. Those treated with this compound also experienced a significantly greater reduction in their overall aggression as well as their depressive symptoms than those treated with placebo.” These results suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective monotherapy for women with moderately severe BPD.

Evidence:"However, soy formula has not been shown to be effective in preventing the development of atopy in ‘at-risk’ children. And may actually worsen atopic illness with prolonged use. Examples of soy formulas include Isomil, Prosobee and Nestle Good Start Soy.Consuming high levels of soy can have potential risks for babies. For example, the phytoestrogen compounds in soy formula might affect babies’ growing neuroendocrine systems and immune systems. But there’s no compelling research to say what effects these have on babies.Soy-based formulas don’t prevent or reduce the risk of your child developing allergies.A Cochrane review concluded that feeding with soy formula should not be recommended for preventing atopy in infants at high risk of developing an allergy.Further research may be warranted to determine the role of soy formulas for preventing allergy or food intolerance in infants who are unable to be breastfed, who have a strong family history of allergy or cow’s milk protein intolerance.The RAcP policy for the use of soy formula in infants recommends:
infants under 12 months who are not breastfed should be fed infant formula, not a soy drink or dairy-based milk marketed for older children or adult consumption
soy-based infant formula should not be used for preterm infants
the possible interaction of soy-based formula with thyroxin replacement therapy should be considered for children with thyroid disorders. A number of concerns have been raised about soy-based infant formulas, on the basis of possible physiological effects of isoflavone compounds on the infant’s developing neuroendocrine system."

This program is beneficial if you have severe hip arthritis.The physical therapist has you do light impact exercises to start with, such as stationary bike exercise, walking, or yoga. The next stage involves muscular endurance exercises, which are light strength training. In the final phase of the program, the therapist has you doing proper strength training.Orthopedic SurgeonAre you experiencing chronic hip pain?

 21 August 2013
A new review from New Zealand suggests that there is little to no evidence that supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C, improves women's chances becoming pregnant. The review analyzed data from 28 trials involving a total of 3,548 women many of whom underwent fertility treatment, including taking antioxidant supplements (e.g., vitamins, amino acids and/or omega-3 fatty acids) to try to increase their chances of becoming pregnant (1). The analysis showed that women taking anti-oxidants did not significantly increase their chances of conceiving or having a baby, compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid. Women taking antioxidants exper-ienced no more adverse effects compared to those who received placebos or standard treatment. Overall, the researchers considered the quality of the analyzed trials to be of a low standard."
