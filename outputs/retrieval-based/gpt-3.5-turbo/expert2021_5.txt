Evidence:"Of course, as your child's temperature climbs, it can make you nervous (especially if he's had a febrile seizure before) and him uncomfortable. If your child is really uncomfortable (so that he can't sleep, for example) and his fever is 103 degrees or higher, then I'd suggest you give him the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring his fever down so that he — and you — can rest. If fever-reducing medication isn't a good option for your child — because he's allergic to the medicine or doesn't take medicine very well, or you'd rather not give him any — a lukewarm bath or sponge bath won't hurt him, and it may help reduce his temperature. (Bathing a child with a fever was a common practice before these fever reducers were available.) Just make sure that the water is lukewarm to warm, not cool, because shivering can actually raise your child's temperature rather than help bring it down. You might also find that your child enjoys a cool washcloth on his forehead."
Question:Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?

yes

Evidence:"Folate deficiency and possible deficiency are defined when the level of plasma/serum folate is <6.8 nmol/L and 13.5 nmol/L, respectively (WHO, 2015). Previous studies showed that low folate level is not only associated with specific domains of cognitive functioning, e.g., episodic recall and recognition (Wahlin et al., 1996; Hassing et al., 1999; Nurk et al., 2005; De Lau et al., 2007), but also associated with all types of dementia, including vascular dementia and AD (Clarke et al., 1998; Ebly et al., 1998; Morris, 2003; Zhuo et al., 2011; Douaud et al., 2013; Cascalheira et al., 2015). In addition, folate/folic acid supplementation is beneficial to the improvement of cognitive functions in aged subjects and cases of mild cognitive impairment (Fioravanti et al., 1997; Morris, 2003; Durga et al., 2007; De Jager et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2019). Moreover, deprivation of folate increases tau phosphorylation, the major component of neurofibrillary tangles (Chan and Shea, 2006). However, there has not been a meta-analysis study to investigate the association between folate deficiency/possible deficiency and the risk of AD, as well as the benefical effect of sufficient folate intake on the prevention of AD. This study aims to investigate the role of folate deficiency/possible deficiency in the risk of AD and the benefical effect of sufficient folate intake on the prevention of AD in addition to updating the association between plasma/serum folate levels and AD."

Evidence:"But that’s the last thing you should do, says Angela Gibson, MD, PhD, who specializes in the surgical treatment of burns and trauma at UW Health’s Burn Center.“It makes you feel better, but the ice could lead to a deepening of the burn because it causes constriction of the blood vessels,” Gibson explains. Nearly a half million people seek treatment for burns every year, and many more deal with mild burns at home. Burn injuries are classified with degrees: first-degree burns affect just the top layer of skin (epidermis), second-degree burns reach the dermis layer in the middle, and third-degree burns affect the full thickness of skin, down to the layer of fat underneath the dermis.

For example, researchers have identified a significantly higher rate of B12 deficiency in some people with vitiligo, along with thyroid dysfunction and diabetes. It can be challenging to identify a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Currently, no vitamin deficiencies are known to be the sole cause of vitiligo. Despite this finding, studies have not consistently found a benefit of taking B12 or folic acid in those who do not have a deficiency. Many people with vitiligo experiment with vitamins and herbal supplements that they believe will benefit their skin and immune system."

common cold,fever,flu
Is the old adage “feed a cold, starve a fever” true? NorthShore's Robert Mitchell Figura, D.O., puts to rest the truth of this ancient wisdom. The reason people say “feed a cold” is because the body needs energy when it's fighting illness. This applies to both colds and flu, but for different reasons. For a cold, eating healthy food will provide the body the extra energy it needs to fight illness, but can also help the body generate heat. The cold virus replicates faster in a cold environment so raising your body's temperature along with bundling up can stop cold germs in their tracks, said Dr. Figura."

Evidence:"The doctor is correct, that cysts don’t go away any faster while on birth control pills than if not on them at all. However, many physicians use them when a cyst is found. The reasoning for this is that while on the pill, the brain’s normal hormone production that stimulates the ovary gets placed on hold. This prevents the brain from trying to start an ovulation on top of the already present cysts. If this occurred, the new follicles could then be later confused with the previous cysts on ultrasound, thus complicating the picture. Also, when on a birth control pill, once that the cyst has resolved, the physician can then just stop the pill at that point and immediately start ovulation medication if needed."

In the two-and-a-half years since its approval by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in March 2017, opinions have been overwhelmingly favorable. However, some patients have reported side effects or have not benefitted as much as they had hoped. Paul Yamauchi, MD, PhD, a dermatologist in private practice in Santa Monica, California, estimates that between two-thirds and three-fourths of his patients with AD have done well on the drug. “Dupixent doesn’t totally clear the risk of future eczema outbreaks, but it succeeds in managing symptoms,” he said. “Most of my patients experience less itching, a reduction in the rash, better sleep and a better quality of life overall.”

Evidence:"A claim that he seemed to back up since there have been thousands of testimonies from patients stating that Hoxsey's tonic did indeed save their lives by curing them from all sorts of cancers, many of which were considered late stage 4 terminal cases with absolutely no hope of survival.He was arrested more than 100 times during his lifetime and was hounded mercilessly until the government closed down his 17 domestic clinics (main one being in Dallas). He then instructed his head nurse Mildred Nelson to take the treatment down to Tijuana, B.C. Mexico in order to carry on his legacy. Here the clinic is still in business to this day.I also highly recommend the fabulous book When Healing becomes a Crime by Kenny Ausubel, which is meticulously researched and superbly written by a very skilled and creative author. Why is it that after nearly 100 years of our government claiming to be looking for a cure for the scourge of the ages that they have come woefully short of anything even approaching a reasonable and safe treatment, let alone a cure? Perhaps it is because they are not really looking to cure a disease that the medical industry makes hundreds of billions of dollars from each and every year."

Evidence:"Countries that typically have a high green tea intake, like China and Japan, have a much lower rate of depression than western countries, where green tea intake is not as high. This may provide evidence of a link between L-theanine and the treatment of anxiety. L-Theanine: A Natural Supplement for Anxiety? Studies show that increasing intake of theanine can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heartbeat and increased secretion of immunoglobulin A in saliva. Its effects are somewhat similar to those of a sedative, but L-theanine is far from this prescription drug. It is actually considered to be an effective anxiolytic, which helps to prevent the brain from producing an anxious response to stressful situations."

Evidence:"It is also not yet known which kind of exercise, or how much, is best or whether the benefits are lost if exercise is stopped.Broadly speaking, keeping active can:help lift mood through improved fitness help improve sleeping patterns increase energy levelshelp block negative thoughts or distract people from daily worrieshelp people feel less alone if they exercise with others.Exercise may also change levels of chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin, endorphins and stress hormones.Depression explainedWhile we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these feelings intensely, for long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent reason. Depression is more than just a low mood – it’s a serious condition that has an impact on both physical and mental health. One in six women and one in eight men will experience depression at some point in their lives. While the exact cause of depression isn't known, a number of things can be associated with its development. Generally, depression does not result from a single cause, but from a combination of biological factors (such as family history, serious medical illness or drug and alcohol use), early childhood experiences, personality factors, recent stressful life events and other personal factors.Exercise and depression evidenceSome  studies  have found that exercise can be a moderately helpful treatment for mild to moderate depression in adults. Exercise should therefore be considered as an important lifestyle change that is used in addition to other treatments for depression."

Evidence:"Wash your hands and go about the rest of your day. Avoid using “home remedy” methods of tick removal, such as rubbing fingernail polish or vaseline petrolatum, using rubbing alcohol, or applying a hot extinguished match directly to the tick. In general, these methods do not result in tick detachment. More importantly, some of these methods may actually induce the tick to salivate (drool!) into the wound."

Evidence:"The school of thought behind mayonnaise as a lice treatment is that the mayonnaise will essentially suffocate the lice. The theory is that applying the mayonnaise to your child’s hair, then applying plastic wrap overnight will prevent the lice from being able to breathe, and the lice will die off. In short, no, mayonnaise does not kill lice. According to the CDC, there is no scientific evidence to support the notion that mayonnaise effectively treats lice. It’s important to realize that lice are considered to be both insects and pests by definition."

Evidence:"So, regular consumption of dates can provide this Vitamin, which is essential in Anemia treatment.Dates increase the amount of iron absorption and prevent Iron deficiencyAccording to the performed studies by different researchers, Vitamin A deficiency leads to Anemia, and this critical and beneficial Vitamin exists in dates, which is an essential factor in synthesizing hemoglobin. Lack of this Vitamin causes low absorption of Iron. Based on nutritionists, consuming Vitamin A together with Iron can prevent iron deficiency. Since dates are rich in Vitamin A, they can be beneficial for treating iron deficiency.Dates improve the level of hematocrit, ferritin and hemoglobinBased on the performed studies, dates effectively treat iron deficiency and Anemia of 8 to 10 aged girls. According to the published research in Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics Journal, dates have an essential role in improving the Level of Iron and hemoglobin in 8 to 10 aged iron-deficient girls. At the beginning of the research, the mean of their hematocrit, ferritin (the standard measure for Iron), and hemoglobin (Hgb) were 34.24 μg/dL, 47.07 μg/dL, and 11.19 μg/dL, respectively."

In these cases, it may feel as though the bone is stuck in the throat, when in reality, it has already passed through the esophagus toward the stomach.However, if the person is spitting blood, can confirm that the bone has impacted, or is having trouble breathing, they should immediately go to their doctor or the emergency room.

Evidence:"Even though the research on the efficacy of zinc as a cold remedy has had conflicting results, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that, “overall zinc appears to be beneficial under certain circumstances.” In fact, several studies have shown that zinc may reduce the number of days you’re sick by inhibiting the replication of the rhinovirus (the virus that’s responsible for the common cold). While your cold may be shorter, that sniffling and sneezing won’t improve in the interim. Plus, some people complain they don’t like the taste of zinc (described as metallic), it can make you nauseous and it may also reduce the effectiveness of any antibiotics or diuretics you may take, cautions the NIH. If taste is an issue, can’t I just take a pill or use a nasal spray? The coating that a zinc lozenge or syrup leaves on your tongue and throat may actually be part of what makes it effective; that’s how it comes into physical contact with the rhinovirus."

Evidence:"Cocoa butter lotion won't prevent stretch marks | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upHealthcare & PharmaUpdated Cocoa butter lotion won't prevent stretch marksBy Reuters Health2 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Applying cocoa butter lotion during pregnancy does not help prevent the stretch marks that many women develop, according to a new study.Stretch marks, or striae gravidarum as doctors refer to them, typically occur on the abdomen and breasts, but can also appear on the hips, thighs, and buttocks. The cause of the problem is unknown, but many women believe that rubbing cocoa butter on the skin can help prevent the marks.Although scientific evidence supporting the use of cocoa butter is lacking, many physicians and midwives continue to recommend it.In the present study, Dr. A. H Nassar and colleagues sought to settle this issue by examining the stretch marks that arose in 210 pregnant women who were randomly assigned to apply cocoa butter or inactive “placebo” to their abdomen, breasts, and thighs once daily starting during the first trimester of pregnancy.Eighty-three percent of women completed the study, Nassar, from the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon and colleagues note.Overall, 45 percent of cocoa butter-treated women developed stretch marks compared with 49 percent of women given placebo lotion. Although the percentage is slightly lower in the cocoa butter group, from a statistical standpoint, the difference was not considered significant, meaning that it may have simply arisen by chance.There was also no difference between the groups in the severity of their stretch marks.“Our findings do not support the use of cocoa butter lotion for the prevention of striae gravidarum,” Nassar and colleagues conclude. Further studies, they say, are needed to confirm their findings in other populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of other commonly used products in preventing stretch marks.SOURCE: BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, August 2008.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Evidence:"NUTRITION & DIETETICSStrengths and limitations of this studyDiarrhoea due to antibiotic therapy is a common complication. Numerous studies have suggested that specific probiotic supplements can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea but none have examined the use of commercially available probiotic yogurt in children.Often studies have examined diarrhoea as an all or none phenomenon, and not a spectrum of disease. We used the Bristol stool scale as an objective measure of stool frequency and consistency and classified these symptoms at different levels of diarrhoea severity.This study shows that giving children on antibiotics a commercially available yogurt with probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, including diarrhoea. Probiotic yogurt may have additional benefits of providing energy and nutrients that are lacking with probiotic supplements/capsules.IntroductionGastrointestinal (GI) upset is a well-known complication of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially the β-lactams, clindamycin and vancomycin. These antibiotics may affect the function of normal bowel flora, cause overgrowth of unfavourable species such as Staphylococcus, Candida, Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella and Clostridium or cause changes in intestinal mucosa and motility.1 These changes often present as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), which is distressing to both patients and carers and may result in poor compliance with antibiotic therapy.2 The frequency of AAD depends on the definition of diarrhoea and the age of the patient but is estimated to be between 11% and 30% for children on oral antibiotics.3 ,4Probiotics are often recommended on the assumption that ingestion of ‘healthy’ bacteria will reduce the disturbance of gut microbiota and subsequent diarrhoea.5 Like pharmaceuticals, different probiotics exert different actions and have different effects. A number of clinical trials have used probiotics for the prevention of AAD."

Evidence:"In fact, review of nine studies involving more than 400 participants found that music therapy was effective in "decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals." Another recent study conducted by researchers at Bournemouth University, explored the effects of music therapy in treating depression among children and adolescents. Results showed that those who received music therapy in addition to talk therapy had substantially improved self-esteem and significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to the children who received treatment without music therapy. Those in the music therapy cycle also showed improvement in communication, social function, and interactive skills.Psychiatrist Michael Crawford highlights several reasons that may explain why music therapy can be effective. He states that, "first, it provides a sense of meaningfulness and pleasure—music is an aesthetic experience that draws in the otherwise passive patient; second, this kind of therapy engages the body and gets people moving—the physical participation averts depression; and finally, it is relational, in that music helps us engage, communicate, and interact with others. We are hardwired to connect and be social, and music allows us to do that."

Evidence:"The study authors concluded that omega-3 fish oil in the form of EPA (1000 mg per day) may be a safe and effective therapy for women with moderately severe borderline personality disorder. How to Take Fish Oil for Borderline Personality Disorder Treatment
Most fish oil supplements contain a combination of EPA and DHA, which are the two major omega-3 fatty acids primarily responsible for fish oil’s health benefits. The most recent study used a concentrated fish oil containing both these fatty acids. In the 2003 Harvard study, however, the researchers used a concentrated form of EPA-only. There is no reason to believe that an EPA-only formulation is necessary, as long as a full 1200 mg of EPA plus DHA or a full 1000 mg of an EPA-only fish oil product is consumed daily. Your fish oil supplement label will list the amount of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids per capsule or serving size."

Evidence:"Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►
High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 
A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults. The study participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting the broad range of global geographic settings, involving Canada, India, Japan, Poland, the UK, and the US. The majority of people recruited to the studies had mild to moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma."

Evidence:"(63) confirmed the preventive effect of SFs in a large prospective study including 391 atopic infants. At the end of the first step (1 year of life), 13% of the participants in the study group and 29% of the participants in the control group had an atopic disease. On the contrary, a meta-analysis by Osborne et al. published in 2004 showed contradictory results: feeding with an SF should not be recommended for the prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk for these diseases (64). The argument is still greatly controversial, mainly because most of the studies that have been conducted either lacked scientific criteria for diagnosing soy allergy or misinterpreted the conclusions. Thus, further studies are necessary to study not only the prevalence of soy allergy in children with CMA and the entire pediatric population but also the preventive effect of soybean on allergic disease development."

Evidence:"A Cochrane database review included 15 clinical trials of 1,219 total participants. Chitosan supplementation slightly improved weight loss (‐1.7 kg on average). However, this review failed to confirm increased fat excretion. The authors concluded that “the effect of chitosan on body weight is minimal and unlikely to be of clinical significance” [15]. Even if chitosan did bind and remove dietary fats, there’s a potential downside to this effect. By attaching to and enhancing the removal of excess fats, it may also increase the elimination of important minerals such as calcium and fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D and vitamin A [16]."
