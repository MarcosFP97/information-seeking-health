No matter how much stretching or preparation you do before a casual jog or a race, even expert runners can find themselves battling pain and injuries, especially ones affecting the feet and lower legs. Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, and ankle sprains are all extremely common for runners—but luckily, there’s gear that can help both prevent injuries and relieve pain in these areas. Consider where you’re looking for more support, or where previous injuries have flared up. Compression socks and sleeves are best for preventing swelling and for post-run recovery, while a sturdier ankle brace is best for running after an ankle sprain or twist. While these products may appear similar at first glance, subtle tweaks make all the difference."
Question:Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis? The answer must be yes or no.

Does a cold shower help a fever? This is one of the most frequently asked questions when it comes to reducing fever. Apparently, the answer is NO. While a cold bath for fever may appear to be a good idea to place a small child in a cool bath to reduce a fever, it is not advised. By chilling the skin and inducing shivering, cold water can raise core body temperature."

). A meta-analysis of large treatment studies investigating older people without dementia or cognitive impairment also reported no overall effect of B vitamins in treatment trials. However, trends were seen for improved global cognitive function and memory(

). Again this may be because some people included in the studies were not folate deficient. A small increased risk for colon cancer is seen with folic acid supplementation, so assessing whether people actually are deficient may be important. There may also be other potential adverse health risks of increasing folate(

Find Clinics offering Wart Removal in London & UK »
  Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy (DTOT) is a wart treatment that is easy to perform at home, which is why many people are interested in using it. If you are curious about DTOT then this article will answer some of your questions about the treatment. What is DTOT (Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy)? DTOT is basically a regime of applying a piece of duct tape on top of warts, usually for about 6 days, before taking that bit of duct tape off to remove dead wart cells by means of a pumice stone or other similar tool. This regime needs to be repeated until the wart is completely removed, and you can expect DTOT to take up to and around 2 months to get rid of a wart.Does Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy work? There remains some debate as to whether or not the Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy technique actually works in comparison to tried and tested treatments like cryotherapy."

Evidence:"Increased fat intake has been associated with the onset of vitiligo [100]. The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has recently been tested in vitiligo, but in combination with phototherapy and other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, with superior benefit compared with placebo [101].As far as vitamins are concerned, the most studied are vitamin B12, vitamin E, and vitamin D. Vitamin B12 and folic acid are involved in DNA repair and methylation. Studies are conflicting regarding vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in vitiligo. Serum vitamin B12 levels in patients were found to be sometimes abnormally low and sometimes normal compared with unaffected patients [102]. In one experimental study, patients treated with a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid and sun exposure repigmented more than patients treated with sun exposure alone; in another study, vitamin B12 and folic acid combined with NB-UVB did not show greater repigmentation than phototherapy alone [103,104].The immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties of vitamin C have been extensively documented. Studies of its supplementation in vitiligo are few."

Evidence:"4Summary of themes regarding barriers and facilitators of the interventionFull size imageDiscussionA 16-week yoga and mindfulness programme for people with severe asthma was feasible, acceptable and benefitted health-related quality of life. Although the small sample size limited the ability to detect statistically significant effects, participants in the yoga group significantly improved their health-related quality of life whereas participants in the active control group had no significant improvement. These data can inform larger studies of yoga interventions to assess whether numeric improvements in dyspnoea and asthma control are reliable. Larger studies of interventions involving activity tracking and goal-setting may also confirm whether physical activity improvements observed in the control group are reliable. When considering how to test and implement exercise interventions for people with severe asthma into the future, qualitative interviews highlighted the following potentially important components: forming social connections, an appropriate setting/structure, changing mindsets, addressing breathing and asthma symptoms, and combining multiple elements into one intervention package.Participants reported impaired health-related quality of life at baseline, which improved for participants in the yoga group.

Evidence:"Therefore, use of zinc supplementation during pregnancy especially for preterm and SGA babies can promote positive outcomes of maternal and child health [18].According to the results of this study, 81% of mothers who had not consumed zinc supplement during pregnancy had zinc levels lower than 60 μg / dl while 35% of mothers having consumed zinc had zinc levels lower than 60 μg / dl during pregnancy (P < 0.001). Gholizadeh showed that high concentration of zinc in mother’s serum was directly associated with dietary intake zinc and supplement zinc. Hanachi indicated that the zinc deficiency in the latter third of pregnancy may suggest insufficient maternal nutrition [19]. There are no valid tools for measuring nutrition zinc adequacy. This evaluation is difficult because of the fact that all digested zinc is not consumed by the organism and its bioavailability may be affected by intestinal absorption or blood circulation. Intestinal absorption may be reduced by dietary antagonistic factors such as phytates, oxalates, tannins, and polyphenols, while circulating zinc may compete with copper and iron, depending on the amount of these elements in the bloodstream [20]."

Evening primrose oil (EPO), is obtained by cold expression or solvent extraction from the seeds of the evening primrose plant (Oenothera biennis).1 Native to North and South America and now widespread throughout Europe and parts of Asia, this biennial plant is also known by the names tree primrose, sun cups, sundrops, king's cure-all, fever plant, evening star, and night willow-herb. Native Americans valued its mucilaginous stem and leaf juices as topical remedies to soothe cutaneous inflammations, whereas poultices of the plant were used to treat bruises and minor wounds.2 Internally, the leaves were used for gastrointestinal ailments and sore throats. Oral EPO is best known for its more recent use in the treatment of systemic diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis.

For example, women who have heavy periods are particularly at risk for the condition, according to the American Society of Hematologists (ASH); some women may need to take an iron supplement or talk to their gynecologist about birth control options that could lessen the bleeding, Dr. Keel says.Or, says Cristina Sutter, MHSc, RD, from Vancouver, Canada, “if you’re an athlete, and you’re losing extra iron through sweat, or a vegetarian who’s short on [iron], just being aware [of your low iron] and remembering to take your supplement and eat a well-balanced diet can make all the difference.”Eat Smart to Increase Your Iron AbsorptionWhat you eat — and when you eat it — can impact iron absorption. Here are a few ways to work more of this mineral into your diet.Eat meat. The best source of iron is heme iron, which comes from animal-based foods including red meat, poultry, and seafood, according to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). While tofu, legumes, and spinach do contain iron, plant-based (or non-heme) iron isn’t as readily absorbed as iron from meat."

Evidence:"Finally, the majority of trials were conducted in developed countries.ConclusionWe found moderate quality of evidence to suggest that orally administered zinc reduces the duration of symptoms of the common cold. However, the evidence of benefit was limited to adults, and even in this patient group, uncertainty remained about its clinical benefit. Although oral zinc treatment may attenuate the symptoms of the common cold, large high-quality trials enrolling adults and children are needed. Future trials should be designed to maximize the tolerable doses of bioavailable zinc with a balanced consideration toward potential dose-related adverse effects. Until further evidence becomes available, there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend zinc for the treatment of the common cold. The questionable benefits must be balanced against the potential adverse effects.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Elizabeth Uleryk for providing invaluable feedback on the literature search."

Can you tell me how it works?by By Mitchell Hecht, For The Inquirer | Columnist Published Nov 2, 2009Question:I've been wearing a copper bracelet for the past year because it helps my arthritis. Can you tell me how it works?Answer: I'm glad that you're finding some pain relief from wearing a copper bracelet. They've been used for hundreds of years to relieve joint pain, and there are even some animal studies that show taking copper supplements by mouth can decrease arthritis progression. Unfortunately, the pain-relieving benefits of wearing a copper bracelet have not held up to scientific scrutiny, and claims that they help are anecdotal.The very first randomized placebo-controlled (where neither the researcher nor the study participant knew whether a copper bracelet or a sham bracelet was being worn) study on the use of copper and magnetic bracelets was just published in the Oct. 12 issue of Complementary Therapies in Medicine. The researchers concluded that there was no meaningful difference between the copper bracelet and the sham bracelet in effect on pain, stiffness, and physical function.The likely explanation for your perceived benefit is in your personal belief that wearing a copper bracelet will help relieve your pain."

Evidence:"Of 175 women who applied either a cocoa butter lotion or a placebo daily, there was no sign of differences in the development and severity of stretch marks. In another study of 300 pregnant women divided evenly between control and treatment groups, 44% of women who used cocoa butter throughout their pregnancy developed stretch marks compared with 55% of women who used a placebo. The findings were not statistically significant. (5) Coconut oil
Coconut oil moisturizes the skin and has anti-bacterial properties, which may help heal wound openings more quickly. This has led some to see it as a way to diminish the appearance of stretch marks although no studies have been conducted to prove this hypothesis. (6) Aloe vera (and wheat germ, too!)"
Question:Does cocoa butter help reduce pregnancy stretch marks? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"These bacteria are collectively known as the gut microbiota.In addition to killing disease-causing bacteria, antibiotics may kill healthy bacteria (3, 4, 5).Taking too many antibiotics can drastically change the amounts and types of bacteria within the gut microbiota, especially in early life (6, 7, 8).In fact, only one week of antibiotics can change the makeup of the gut microbiota for up to a year (9).Some studies have shown that changes to the gut microbiota caused by excessive antibiotic use in early life may even increase the risk of weight gain and obesity (10).Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making them ineffective at killing disease-causing bacteria (11).Finally, by changing the types of bacteria living in the intestines, antibiotics can cause intestinal side effects, including diarrhea (12).Summary: Antibiotics are important for treating infections. However, if overused, they can cause long-term changes to healthy gut bacteria and contribute to liver damage. Take Probiotics During and After TreatmentTaking antibiotics can alter the gut microbiota, which can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially in children.Fortunately, a number of studies have shown that taking probiotics, or live healthy bacteria, can reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (13, 14).One review of 23 studies including nearly 400 children found that taking probiotics at the same time as antibiotics could reduce the risk of diarrhea by more than 50% (15).A larger review of 82 studies including over 11,000 people found similar results in adults, as well as children (16).These studies showed that Lactobacilli and Saccharomyces probiotics were particularly effective.However, given that probiotics are usually bacteria themselves, they can also be killed by antibiotics if taken together. Thus, it is important to take antibiotics and probiotics a few hours apart.Probiotics should also be taken after a course of antibiotics in order to restore some of the healthy bacteria in the intestines that may have been killed.One study showed that probiotics can restore the microbiota to its original state after a disruptive event, such as taking antibiotics (17).If taking probiotics after antibiotics, it may be better to take one that contains a mixture of different species of probiotics, rather than just one.Summary: Taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can reduce the risk of diarrhea, although the two should be taken a few hours apart. Probiotics can also help restore the gut bacteria after antibiotics. Eat Fermented FoodsCertain foods can also help restore the gut microbiota after damage caused by antibiotics.Fermented foods are produced by microbes and include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, kombucha and kimchi, among others.They contain a number of healthy bacterial species, such as Lactobacilli, which can help restore the gut microbiota to a healthy state after antibiotics.Studies have shown that people who eat yogurt or fermented milk have higher amounts of Lactobacilli in their intestines and lower amounts of disease-causing bacteria, such as Enterobacteria and Bilophila wadsworthia (18, 19, 20).Kimchi and fermented soybean milk have similar beneficial effects and can help cultivate healthy bacteria in the gut, such as Bifidobacteria (21, 22).Therefore, eating fermented foods may help improve gut health after taking antibiotics.Other studies have also found that fermented foods may be beneficial during antibiotic treatment.Some of these have shown that taking either normal or probiotic-supplemented yogurt can reduce diarrhea in people taking antibiotics (23, 24, 25).Summary: Fermented foods contain healthy bacteria, including Lactobacilli, which can help restore damage to the microbiota caused by antibiotics."

What Is Music Therapy?6 Health Benefits of Music TherapyHow to Find a Reputable Music Therapist
It’s believed that music has been used since practically the beginning of time to help humans deal with difficult feelings and better connect to one another. Because of its strong and immediate influence over our emotions, coupled with its ability to naturally increase neurochemicals — including “feel good” endorphins — music is now being added to many rehabilitation programs across the world. Music therapy (MT), also commonly referred to as active music therapy or passive music therapy in many studies, has shown promise for improving both motor control and emotional functions in patients with a wide range of diseases or disabilities. From cases of schizophrenia to Parkinson’s disease, musical interventions seem to help naturally decrease symptoms like anxiety or depression, help ignite creativity, improve communications between patients and their caregivers, and much more."

Evidence:"The aim of the systematic review was to determine whether soy infant formulas do indeed prevent allergy and food intolerance, and whether they are linked to any particular benefits or harms to an infant's growth and development.The review appears in the current issue of The Cochrane Library, a publication of The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates research in all aspects of health care. Systematic reviews draw evidence-based conclusions about medical practice after considering both the content and quality of existing trials on a topic.The Cochrane reviewers analysed three studies that compared formulas for prolonged infant feeding. The enrollment size of each was considered small — with the combined number of infants totaling 875. Reviewers did not include studies of infants already diagnosed with food allergies or food intolerances; instead, review studies evaluated infants considered at high risk of allergies based on a strong family history — infants whose parent or sibling had ever had a significant allergy. The studies followed these infants into childhood up to 10 years of age to determine if they had developed allergies or intolerances.Based on the results, the authors concluded there was no significant benefit from the use of a soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula.The review supported previous evidence that mothers who choose to only breastfeed their infants for at least six months do reduce the incidence of allergy.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, women who don't have health problems should "exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least the first six months of life." Breast milk provides the right balance of nutrients to help an infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and some of the nutrients in breast milk also help protect against some common childhood illnesses and infections.Despite these benefits, many mothers still introduce their babies to cow's milk or soy milk formula, which some nutritionists believe may not be an acceptable substitution."

Evidence:"Chitosan adheres to salivary pellicles (negatively charged protein film), reduces plaque, increases salivary secretion, and exerts antibacterial action effective in managing chronic periodontitis.19, 20, 21, 22, 23Chitosan also exerts action against candida and chlamydia.24, 25Cholesterol-lowering effects and weight-lossPositively charged amino groups in chitosan bind to negatively charged lipid and bile components, preventing their absorption by the body.1Animal dataExtensive animal studies have been published demonstrating the effects of chitosan on lipid concentrations in affected rats, very low-density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein levels.26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 In a recent study, chitosan derived from white mushroom exoskeleton (fungal chitosan) decreased body weight gain and fat mass development in mice fed a high-fat diet.32Clinical dataA Cochrane meta-analysis of quality, randomized, controlled clinical trials found a small effect of chitosan on total cholesterol (−0.2 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.3 to −0.1).1 Results of trials published since the meta-analysis are conflicting. Some trials reported no cholesterol-lowering effect of chitosan compared with placebo33, 34 while another reported an effect for chitosan at 4 weeks but no further effect at 12 weeks.35The Cochrane meta-analysis found a statistically significant but clinically insignificant effect for chitosan on body weight (−1.7 kg; 95% CI = −2.1 to −1.3 kg).1 Positive, small changes in fasting blood glucose and blood pressure were also noted.1 The clinical importance of the effect has also been questioned by other reviewers.36, 37Other studies report on the effect of chitosan on fat absorption, again with conflicting results38, 39, 40 with some researchers suggesting a gender-specific response.39The 2017 joint position statement of the Italian Society of Diabetology (ISD) and the Italian Society for the Study of Arteriosclerosis (ISSA) on nutraceuticals for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia strongly recommends the use of fiber (ie, oat beta-glucan, chitosan, glucomannan, guar gum, HPMC, pectin, psyllium) to lower low-density lipoprotein in the general population that fails to increase dietary fiber; in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and low to moderate cardiovascular risk; or in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome (Level I, Strength A).69HemostasisBandages impregnated with chitosan and chitosan granules have been approved by the FDA for use in emergency settings to control blood loss.41 Experiments conducted in pigs41 and in the emergency department42 have shown that topical application of chitosan granules controls bleeding in less than 3 minutes, where pressure alone failed.42 Suggested mechanisms of action include mucoadhesion, platelet activation, vasoconstriction, and ionic action on red blood cells.41, 42Chitosan's characteristic as a film-forming and protective polysaccharide suggests a potential role in wound healing and burns. Its applications in this area have been investigated.43, 44, 45, 46Metabolic syndrome/PrediabetesIn a randomized, double-blind intervention trial (n = 51) in Koreans with prediabetes, 12-week supplementation with chitosan (1,500 mg/day) resulted in statistically significantly improved blood glucose at 30 and 60 minutes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), change in body fat percentage, and waist circumference compared with the placebo group. No significant differences were noted between groups in the level of change of inflammatory biomarkers (ie, interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha). No adverse reactions were observed.68Other usesChitosan (0.1% solution) has been effectively used as an alternative for sodium hyaluronate in long-term, postsurgical ophthalmic management (3 years).47Chitosan 2 g added to an oxalate-rich meal had no effect on urinary oxalate excretion, despite oxalate being negatively charged.48 An antioxidant effect of chitosan has been demonstrated in vitro.49Application of chitosan in the pharmaceutical industry is documented. Its ability to mask bitter tastes in oral pharmaceuticals has been reported.50 There are numerous reports of chitosan being employed in various types of drug delivery systems, including intranasal, transdermal, and site-specific delivery mechanisms, as well as in hydrogels, microspheres, liposomes, matrix forms, and conjugate forms.51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63Dosing
Chitosan has been administered in cholesterol reduction and weight loss clinical studies in wide-ranging doses of 0.24 to 15 g daily (median, 3.7 g/day) for 4 to 24 weeks.1, 33, 34, 35 Chitosan has been administered to patients with renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis without any apparent adverse events.64Chitosan has also been administered to prediabetic patients for glucose control at a dose of 1,500 mg/day.68A chitosan 0.1% solution has been used in ophthalmology47 while 1% w/w solutions have been used as a mouthwash.19 Chewing gums releasing 2% w/v in saliva have been used in dental studies.20, 21Pregnancy / Lactation
