Evidence:"But sometimes misinformation can develop even around ideas that have some truth to them - and that can be the most difficult kind to tackle.Why vitamin D?There are many treatments that have been suggested for Covid-19.Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin and vitamin D - all are, or were, being studied. Suggesting that a treatment could be effective and then finding it isn't upon further research is all part of the normal scientific process. But online, early or low quality research can be shared out of context. And the confusion this creates can be exploited by people promoting conspiracy theories. There is some logic behind why vitamin D might be useful in treating or preventing Covid.It plays a role in immunity and it's already recommended that everyone in the UK take the supplement in the winter, with those at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency advised to take it all year round."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It is possible that HCWs may become less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 as a result of improved preventive practices, reduced community transmission and/or following the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, once COVID-19-specific vaccines become available, interest in participating in the current trial might wane. We have therefore chosen diverse recruitment settings and included secondary outcome measures to evaluate the impact of BCG vaccination on other illnesses and infections (febrile and/or respiratory symptoms, herpes simplex virus reactivation) and on the immune system overall (immunological studies).PerspectiveThis trial is designed to determine whether BCG vaccination can reduce the incidence and/or severity of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also aims to provide data on the ability of BCG vaccination to reduce the overall rate and/or severity of febrile and respiratory illnesses in adults. This is particularly important for viral outbreaks that coincide with the winter influenza season, and could help to reduce the overall strain on the healthcare system. If the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of BCG vaccination is correct, then this vaccine could be implemented as an early intervention to protect HCWs and other high-risk groups in future novel respiratory virus outbreaks.DisseminationThe trial protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327206) and is available in the online supplemental material."

yes

Evidence:"OTTAWA â Health Canada is aware of reports, including on social media, that reference safety issues with the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 cases. There is no scientific evidence that establishes a link between ibuprofen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. The Government of Canada is monitoring the situation closely, including reviewing new information and reports as they become available, and will take the appropriate action to help protect the health and safety of Canadians. Some reports have suggested that there are risks of using ibuprofen to treat symptoms of infection. In August 2019, Health Canada initiated a safety review of ibuprofen and the risk of certain serious bacterial infections in children with chicken pox, and has recently concluded there was no link. A summary of this review is expected to be published shortly."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Neither do German scientists and experts advocate the use of salt water gargle against COVID-19. Fact #3 : Gargling Cannot Prevent COVID-19
Gargling cannot prevent COVID-19, because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted through three principle ways :
inhalation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles,
deposition of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles on exposed mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eye, and
touching mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eye, with contaminated hands
Gargling cannot prevent infection when you breathe in the coronavirus, or if infectious droplets fall onto your eyes. Neither can gargling prevent infection when you accidentally touch your mouth, nose or eye with contaminated hands. Fact #4 : COVID-19 Does Not Germinate In Your Throat
The fake news suggests that COVID-19 germinates for a week in your throat. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will not “chill out” and multiply in your throat for a week, before heading to your lungs."

Image source, ReutersImage caption, The army has been brought in to distribute medical suppliesCovid is mainly caught by inhaling tiny droplets in the air via the nose as well as the mouth, so gargling attacks only one point of entry. And once the virus has entered, it replicates and spreads deep into the organs, where no amount of gargling can reach.Painkillers and antibioticsState television has advised patients to use painkillers such as ibuprofen as well as amoxicillin and other antibiotics.Ibuprofen (and paracetamol) can bring down a temperature and ease symptoms such as headache or sore throat but they won't clear the virus or prevent it developing. Antibiotics, meant for bacterial infections not viruses, are not recommended - and risks developing resistant bugs. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Painkillers can help with symptoms - but will not stop the virusLaboratory research suggests some may slow the spread of some viruses, including Covid but these have not been replicated in the real world.A study of the antibiotic azithromycin found it made little or no difference to Covid symptoms, the likelihood of hospital admission or death. There are some approved drugs to prevent people with Covid from ending up in hospital: anti-viral drugs paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir), and antibody therapies which mimic our own immune system."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"To learn more about the trial, visit remapcap.org. In past trials, convalescent plasma was found to be ineffective in treating patients with COVID-19. Why are we participating in another trial?While past studies we contributed convalescent plasma to, and others internationally, did not demonstrate sufficient benefit for the patients enrolled, the results did show COVID-19 convalescent plasma contains antibodies of different types, amounts and functions and that these antibodies can vary significantly from one donor to another. Therefore, there may be potential benefit from plasma with more antibodies compared to plasma with fewer antibodies. The timing of how quickly and frequently convalescent plasma is administered may also be a factor, as some studies have shown repeated transfusions earlier in patient care could lead to improved effects. And data from one of the studies we supported (REMAP-CAP) suggested that patients who were immunocompromised may benefit from convalescent plasma."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"They investigated Kaiser Permanente Healthcare members who were aged 65 or over as of 1st March 2020 and eligible for pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. Their study involved 531,033 individuals. They found that within this cohort receipt of the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine PCV13 was associated with a lower incidence of any COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 hospitalisation and fatal COVID-19. Their results were consistent with previous findings of interactions between pneumococci and respiratory viruses contributing to the PCV efficacy against virus associated pneumonia amongst both children and older adults. Their study supports the hypothesis that interactions with pneumococci in the upper airways contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in three respects:
Similarity of the PCV13 effect estimates across all three outcomes suggesting that protection arose from the prevention at an early stage of COVID-19 pathogenesis rather than prevention of severe post-infection sequalae which would have led to a higher effectiveness against hospitalisation and death. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting a low burden of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia following SARS-CoV-2 infection, in contrast to experience with other viral pathogens such as influenza."

Evidence:"In addition to these factors, though, "there's quite a lot of good evidence that ... female immune systems are essentially a lot stronger," she added. Related: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across speciesThe sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which women produce in larger quantities than men, help to regulate the female immune system and may grant women special resistance against infections and harmful immune system responses, the Times reported. With that in mind, scientists at Cedars-Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University plan to treat small groups of COVID-19 patients with the hormones, to see if they make a difference. "We may not understand exactly how estrogen works [to counteract COVID-19], but maybe we can see how the patient does," Dr. Sharon Nachman, the principal investigator of the Stony Brook University trial, told the Times. The Stony Brook trial will include 110 patients with confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 who develop at least one serious symptom, such as high fever, shortness of breath or pneumonia, but do not yet require mechanical breathing support through intubation, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. All men ages 18 and older may enter the trial, as well as women ages 55 and older (women's estrogen levels tend to decline after menopause.)"

If you develop shortness of breath or pain with breathing, we ask that you do a virtual video visit so a provider can assess your illness. Here are some recommendations to help with your symptoms, including over-the-counter options:
Be sure to rest and stay well hydrated (drink plenty of water). Keep in mind that cold fluids may worsen your cough, so it is best to drink room temperature or warm beverages instead. You may take an expectorant/cough suppressant combination as needed for cough and congestion."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commentary and more recently by Morawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.ReferencesAnfinrud P, Stadnytskyi V, Bax CE, et al.

      This document aims to support public health preparedness planning and response activities based upon social distancing measures aimed at minimising the spread of COVID-19. Available in 26 languages. Executive summary
Social distancing is an action taken to minimise contact with other individuals; social distancing measures comprise one category of non-pharmaceutical countermeasures (NPCs)1 aimed at reducing disease transmission and thereby also reducing pressure on health services. This document builds upon existing ECDC documents, including guidelines for the use of non-pharmaceutical measures to delay and mitigate the impact of 2019-nCoV, a rapid risk assessment: outbreak of novel coronavirus disease – 6th update, a technical report on the use of evidence in decision-making during public health emergencies, and a guidance document on community engagement for public health events caused by communicable disease threats in the EU/EEA."

And to state the obvious, when fit and in good shape, we will beat any virus 100 times out of 100. But the sad truth is that most of us are neither fit nor in good shape.And Covid 19 is no normal virus. Once thought to be a pathogen that primarily attacks the lungs, it has turned out to be a much more formidable foe – impacting nearly every major organ system in the body. And there is no proven cure yet. So lets not leave anything to chance."

Evidence:"Facts on UV and COVID-19
Can UVC help prevent COVID-19 transmission by reducing contamination? Based on existing evidence, we believe so. Here’s why:
UVC light has been used extensively for more than 40 years in disinfecting drinking water, waste water, air, pharmaceutical products, and surfaces against a whole suite of human pathogens (Fluence UV Dose Required review IUVA). All bacteria and viruses tested to date (many hundreds over the years, including other coronaviruses) respond to UV disinfection. Some organisms are more susceptible to UVC disinfection than others, but all tested so far do respond at the appropriate doses. UVC disinfection is often used with other technologies in a multibarrier approach to ensure that whatever pathogen is not “killed” by one method (say filtering or cleaning) is inactivated by another (UVC)."

Brief Summary:
Natural products with immunomodulation and antiviral activity showed a promising improvement in the outcomes of some viral infectious diseases both in preclinical and primitive clinical studies. The aim of this study is to utilize Saudi FDA licensed Nigella sativa (NS) seed oil towards improving disease outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with mild COVID-19. The study will be a prospective, open-label, non-randomized controlled pilot trial. Patients will be supplemented (add-on) with one capsule of black seed oil twice daily for 10 days. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who clinically recovered on day 14."

Evidence:"Steam therapy may also help people sleep. A 2019 study showed that warm steam inhalation before bedtime helped participants relax and increased deep sleep, which led to improved sleep quality in adult men with mild sleep issues and anxiety.One thing steam therapy doesn't cure: COVID-19. While inhaling steam may help ease some coronavirus symptoms, there is no evidence that steam kills the virus. Herbs most beneficial for steam inhalation:Many herbs can help increase the beneficial effects of steam therapy. Here are five popular choices:  Thyme: This herb is an expectorant (helps loosen mucus) and has antibacterial properties. "It's my favorite essential oil for steam therapy because it has great benefits, and it's not an irritant like some stronger oils can be," says Jones."

Evidence:"So let’s take a look at what excessive alcohol consumption does to make you more susceptible to COVID-19. Part 1: Drinking Alcohol and the Immune System
Alcohol is known to cause inflammation in the body, leading to an immune deficiency. Drinking alcohol to excess weakens your immune system and makes you more prone to COVID-19, and it also lengthens its duration. Drinking alcohol in excess may also cause stomach problems, liver damage, pancreatitis, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, and stroke due to blood flow loss and low blood pressure.Your immune system’s job is to help your body determine which cells are healthy or unhealthy. Your immune system protects you from harmful threats such as viruses and bacteria. It consists of several different types of white blood cells and proteins and some other components that protect you from harmful infections, such as COVID-19.It also helps to fight cancerous tumors and helps to prevent an overgrowth of scar tissue in wounds."

Evidence:"The data collection instrument did not allow to collect information regarding the severity of disease and therefore it is most likely that majority of these patients were moderate or severe. Data was collected at a single time point. However, our analysis presents findings of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir in real-life clinical settings in India and adds to the clinical evidence on remdesivir use in COVID-19.ConclusionThe retrospective analysis of data from an active surveillance programme of remdesivir therapy in patients with COVID-19 showed that remdesivir was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. The clinical outcome of cure and improvement rate was 84%, with greater improvement in patients with age < 60 years and receiving standard low-flow oxygen and mortality rate was 6.77%.

Evidence:"What really stands out is that there is a 68% to nearly 70% increase in COVID-19 mortality if you’re obese,” said Dr Rosenfeld, chair of the Committee on Plant-Based Health and Nutrition at SUNY Downstate Health Science University. In addition to obesity, nearly 60% of patients with COVID-19 have diabetes; those with diabetes have approximately an 8% increase in COVID-19-related death, according to Dr Rosenfeld. Nearly 20% of COVID patients have hypertension, which increases mortality by approximately 6% and increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19 by 66%. The key to reducing these risks is eating more whole grains, fruits, nuts, seeds, and legumes while reducing salt, said Dr Rosenfeld. Following a plant-based diet may be the best way to prevent or reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other chronic noninfectious diseases, he noted. To round out a healthy lifestyle, Dr Rosenfeld recommended getting 150 minutes per week of exercise, sleeping 7 to 9 hours per night, and reducing meat intake."

EMA advises continued use of medicines for hypertension, heart or kidney disease during COVID-19 pandemic
Press release 27/03/2020
EMA is aware of recent media reports and publications which question whether some medicines, for instance angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, or sartan medicines), could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19). ACE inhibitors and ARBs are most commonly used for treating patients with high blood pressure, heart failure or kidney disease.It is important that patients do not interrupt their treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and there is no need to switch to other medicines. There is currently no evidence from clinical or epidemiological studies that establishes a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the worsening of COVID-19. Experts in the treatment of heart and blood pressure disorders, including the European Society of Cardiology, have already issued statements along those lines.1  To gather more evidence, EMA is proactively reaching out to researchers working to generate further evidence in epidemiological studies.As the public health crisis rapidly extends across the globe, scientific research is ongoing to understand how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reproduces in the body, interacts with the immune system and causes disease, and whether ongoing treatment with medicines such as ACE-inhibitors and ARBs could impact the prognosis of COVID-19.The speculation that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs treatment can make infections worse in the context of COVID-19 is not supported by clinical evidence. These medicines work by affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Because the virus uses a target called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of this system, to enter human cells, and the medicines can increase ACE2, one of the suggestions among others is that they could also increase virus activity."
Question:Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In a review of 5 studies published to date,3 smoking is most likely associated with getting sicker with COVID-19. In the largest study of 1099 people with COVID-19,4 people who smoke were 2.4 times more likely to get really sick (e.g. admitted to an intensive care unit, needing mechanical ventilation, dying) compared to those who did not smoke. Smoking can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other health problems that may contribute to serious illness.2  Stopping smoking still helps your health if you have COPD or heart disease.5
Vaping can also harm lung health. Growing evidence suggests that the aerosol from vaping devices can harm lungs at the cellular and organ levels and worsen the body’s ability to fight respiratory infections.6 The recent outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping-associated product lung injury, predominantly affecting young people, is still a major public health concern.7

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"“Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19 but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is more likely candidate for follow-up studies.”Of course, there are a number of risk factors beyond blood type known to play a role in COVID-19 severity, from age to pre-existing illness. So these findings should not be a cause for concern to those with type A blood.Instead, as co-last author on the study Gerome Breen explains, these findings help researchers investigate novel therapeutic pathways to help treat COVID-19. For example, several blood proteins were identified in the study as causally linked to a decreased risk of severe disease.These proteins, known as adhesion molecules, play a role in the interactions between immune cells and blood vessels. The researchers hypothesize these adhesion molecules may be helping moderate the severity of late-stage COVID-19 and it may be possible to turn this discovery into a therapy to prevent sick patients deteriorating in hospital.“What we have done in our study is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research,” said Breen. “Out of 1,000s of blood proteins we have whittled it down to about 14 that have some form of causal connection to the risk of severe COVID-19 and present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies.”The new study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics.Source: King’s College London

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued 
 recalls for products containing methanol, which is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It can cause problems ranging from nausea and headaches to blindness, nervous system damage or death. An FDA 
 import alert also warns about products found to contain methanol and/or 1-propanol, another form of alcohol that should not be used in hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizer poisonings during the COVID-19 pandemicSince families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System has been getting many more reports of unintentional exposures in children. Many are for children ages 5 years and younger. Health experts recommend using hand sanitizer that is 60% to 95% alcohol to kill the virus that causes COVID-19."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It’s not known whether people who used to vape are at higher risk of COVID-19 disease. Starting and using stop-smoking medications For people who smoke, prescribed stop-smoking tablets or nicotine replacement therapy (like patches, gum, lozenge or spray) can help to reduce cravings and manage withdrawal symptoms. When combined with tailored support from Quitline, these medications give people the best chance of successfully quitting. There is no evidence that COVID-19 affects the safety and effectiveness of these medications. If you are already using these medications, it is safe to continue to do so, as instructed by your doctor. If you are thinking about starting these medications, it is best to first speak with a Quitline counsellor (13 78 48) or your doctor."

Evidence:"Vietnam veterans snuck it home to curb PTSD; Bay Area activists distributed it to those coping with AIDS and cancer in the ‘80s and ‘90s. And patients with various ailments today rely on medical marijuana to treat pain, nausea, and many other issues. But a new study published in the Journal of Cannabis Research indicates that active cannabis users actually fared better after contracting COVID-19 than non-users, including lower ICU admission rates and need for ventilation intervention. Unlike a recent CBD study that was mis-represented as a miracle cure for COVID by some on social media, this study actually finds some evidence that regular cannabis smokers suffered less severe symptoms of the virus. Here’s what that study actually found
Authored by researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, analyzed at 1,831 adult patients admitted to two UCLA hospitals between February 2020 and February 2021."

Evidence:"Patients with the highest risk tend to be older than 50, have a history of a retinal disease such as macular degeneration or have previously taken tamoxifen for breast cancer. COVID-19 patients were given roughly twice the dosage of these drugs than normally given for autoimmune problems, but they only took them for 1-2 weeks. It is unlikely that this dose will cause retinal problems. What are signs of retina problems from malaria drugs? Patients who develop retinal damage from hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may not notice changes in their vision at first. As the damage worsens, symptoms may include:
Trouble focusing on objects straight ahead, due to loss of central vision
Difficulty reading

THE benefits of using inhalers and nebulisers containing steroids outweigh the risks despite warnings to the contrary during the COVID-19 pandemic, a study by University of Huddersfield researchers has found. A warning issued by WHO in March advised that steroids used in inhalers and nebulisers could have a negative effect on a user’s immunity system, leaving them more susceptible to COVID-19. The concern was that regular steroid use could leave users vulnerable to contracting the virus or developing a more severe version than non-users. WHO’s cautionary note caused worry for people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leaving them unsure about whether they could keep using inhalers and nebulisers or not."

Evidence:"“We were trying to prove that vitamin D actually could prevent COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections,” principal investigator Dr. Arne Søraas in the Department of Microbiology at Oslo University Hospital explained to Medical News Today. “There has been a lot of research into vitamin D as a ‘booster’ for the immune system and even meta-analyses that have shown it to be effective in preventing such infections. There was, therefore, a hope that it could also prevent COVID-19 which is also an airway infection.”— Dr. Arne SøraasThis study focused on the use of a cod liver oil supplement to prevent acute respiratory infections and COVID-19. Cod liver oil contains high amounts of vitamin D, vitamin A, and omega-3 fatty acids. Dr. Søraas said he also led the Norwegian Corona Cohort study where scientists followed 200,000 Norwegians through the pandemic. “There we observed that cod liver oil users were less likely to catch COVID-19,” he said."

Evidence:"Remestemcel-L is being explored as a potential treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19.In a statement, Mesoblast outlined that it considered the observed mortality reduction in patients in trials to be ‘sufficiently strong’ to continue development of the drug. The company stated that it is currently preparing a pivotal Phase III trial to support an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).In the short term, however, it means that Mesoblast will miss out on a $25m (€22.5m) upfront payment and a $25m equity investment that were agreed by Novartis, subject to the closing of the deal.As the deal was terminated prior to its closing, Novartis is no longer obliged to make the payments. The initial deal was agreed late last year, as the pharma giant made several such moves to potentially bring a COVID-19 vaccine​​ or treatment into its portfolio.In terms of plans going forward for the drug, a spokesperson for Mesoblast told BioPharma-Reporter that the company has “ongoing discussions with numerous potential pharma partners across its program, including remestemcel-L for respiratory indications.”​Mesoblast has also met with the the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in regard to a potential EUA, with the agency telling the company that an additional statistically positive clinical study ‘might be sufficient’ to support the application.The next steps are to agree with the FDA the final protocol and potency assay, the spokesperson added.Troubled path to commercialization​The decision by Novartis adds further difficulty in Mesoblast’s efforts to commercialize remestemcel-L, which suffered rejection by the FDA for a different indication last year, despite the drug being recommended for approval by the agency’s advisory committee​​.Mesoblast was seeking approval for the treatment for pediatric steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease. However, the FDA stated that it would need at least one more randomized controlled study before reconsidering approval.The company’s spokesperson outlined that it is still in discussions with the FDA’s Office of tissues and Advanced Therapies “to address the appropriateness of potency assays related to remestemcel-L’s proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism with the goal of resubmission of the Biologics License Application.”​In this indication, the spokesperson stated that Mesoblast has no need of a partner, as it has the capacity to manage the potential commercialization process by itself.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The virus (HIV) that produces AIDS in humans does not develop in mosquitoes. If HIV-infected blood is taken up by a mosquito the virus is treated like food and digested along with the blood meal. If the mosquito takes a partial blood meal from an HIV positive person and resumes feeding on a non-infected individual, insufficient particles are transferred to initiate a new infection. If a fully engorged mosquito with HIV positive blood is squashed on the skin, there would be insufficient transfer of virus to  infect. The virus diseases that use insects as agents of transfer produce tremendously high levels of parasites in the blood."

Evidence:"So even if you want to make it, you might not be able to find rubbing alcohol and aloe vera at your local drugstore.You should avoid recipes that call for vodka or spirits because you need a high proof liquor to get the right concentration of alcohol by volume. That's because most liquor is mixed with water, so if you mix a 80-proof vodka (which is the standard proof) with aloe, you'll have hand sanitizer that contains less than 40% alcohol. In response to a tweet about someone using Tito's Vodka to make DIY hand sanitizer, the company responded by saying that you shouldn't use its product for that purpose. So what should you do instead?Wash your hands. The CDC and WHO both agree that's the best thing you can do right now to protect yourself from getting sick, either from coronavirus or anything else. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, many times per day -- after you use the restroom, before and after you eat, before and after you prepare food and in many other scenarios.Also avoid touching your face in general, but especially with dirty hands."

                                        Triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial
Patients
Combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days is better than lopinavir-ritonavir in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19
