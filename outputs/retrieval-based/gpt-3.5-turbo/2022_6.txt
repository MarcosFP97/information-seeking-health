Evidence:"While you might be thinking gauze is all you need, tea bags for wisdom teeth are a great method for helping stop bleeding as well as forming a blood clot (which protects the bone as the wound heals). So, what kind of tea bags should be used for wisdom teeth? According to a study in the Hindawi Journal that looked into the effect of green tea extract on the prevention of gingival bleeding after a tooth extraction, green tea contains polyphenol compounds and tannins that have antioxidant properties. These tannins can be significantly effective in stopping the bleeding of sockets caused by tooth extractions and reducing oozing. The topical use of green tea also has anti-hemorrhaging properties, according to a study in the Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences, it can reduce bleeding time and promote the wound healing process."

If you’re plugged into the world of alternative medicine, you’ve probably heard about “crystals”— the name given to minerals (usually quartz) or fossilized resins that are believed to have beneficial health properties. Holding crystals or placing them on your body is thought to promote physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Crystals supposedly do this by positively interacting with your body’s energy field, or chakra. While some crystals are said to alleviate stress, others purportedly improve concentration or creativity. Unsurprisingly, researchers have carried out few conventional studies on crystals."

Evidence:"Among the OA patients, glucosamine and chondroitin are most commonly used and have shown to considerably reduce the pain associated with arthritis. From the nutraceutical point of view, there is a growing interest in Collagen Supplement as a solution for the treatment of OA. The Collagen Supplement has been studied extensively in both animals as well as human clinical studies. , Among animal studies, a study in the rat model of OA reported several benefits after treatment, suggesting its potential for the prevention of worsening of articular cartilage damage. In another study, porcine Collagen Supplement administration demonstrated a significant reduction of pain intensity. Also, a lower dose regimen showed meaningful pain reduction indicating its protective effect on the cartilage."

Evidence:"Here's what some expert agencies have to say:The FDA says that neither research results nor public health statistics have clearly shown that normal use of cellphones raises the risk of cancer.The International Agency for Research on Cancer says the radiation from cell phones is "possibly" a cancer-causing substance.The CDC says science hasn't given us a definite answer and more research is needed. The bottom line is that no one can say for sure right now whether there's a link between cell phones and cancer. Decades of studies have led to conflicting results. And scientists are still studying the issue.But if you're concerned, there are steps you can take to reduce how much radiation you're exposed to from your cell phone. That radiation is what might link cell phones to cancer.Radiation From Cell PhonesCell phones give off small amounts of a type of radiation called radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves. It's called non-ionizing radiation, and it's the same type you find in FM radio waves and microwaves.It’s different from ionizing radiation, which comes from things like X-rays and ultraviolet light."

Evidence:"The charity urges people taking ibuprofen not to stop without checking first with their GP or specialist. Dr Taher Mahmud, a consultant rheumatologist at the London Osteoporosis Clinic, called it  ‘very sad and concerning’ that patients are resorting to home remedies such  as WD-40. ‘Failure to replace NSAIDs with other proven therapies can have a huge impact on patients’  lives,’ he adds. ‘They can be in severe pain and so stiff they are unable to wash and dress themselves, or be  left bed-bound.’The experience with ibuprofen highlights concerns that the speed at which the pandemic is evolving means evidence about what does and doesn’t work is not always being rigorously examined.There is particular concern that pre-prints, early drafts of medical and scientific papers that have not been peer-reviewed — the lengthy process of being vetted for omissions and flaws by other academics in the field — are being given undue weight during the pandemic.Hugh Pennington, an emeritus bacteriology professor at the University of Aberdeen, says: ‘There’s a mass of science coming out every day and some of it is conflicting.‘Sometimes it is just too early to say.

Evidence:"In rare instances, swollen lymph glands can be a sign of a mosquito-borne illness like Dengue fever, but more often than not the symptom is found in children that have been bitten by a mosquito and usually it fades as the bite is treated or diminished
Mild headaches: Having a mild headache is considered a moderate reaction to a mosquito bite, normally appearing in those who have a weakened immune system. You can experience slight pain or tension, but it is not usually persistent and can be relieved used conventional painkillers or home solutions. If your headache intensifies or is prolonged, it might be a sign of a more serious illness and you should consult your doctor as soon as possible
Low fever: A mild or low fever is a symptom that can sometimes occur, normally when the immune system is struggling to fight off an invasive pathogen. You might find that your temperature is slightly, but not alarmingly, higher than usual. This symptom should begin to diminish within a few days but if it persists or worsens, you should speak to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a more serious, mosquito-borne illness.

Evidence:"Although cancer is common, only 5-10% of it is hereditary, meaning an individual has inherited an increased risk for cancer from one of their parents. This inherited risk for cancer is caused by a small change (called a mutation) in a gene, which can be passed from one generation to the next in a family. When someone inherits this type of gene mutation from a parent, they have an increased risk to get a certain type (or types) of cancer. Some cancers that can be hereditary are:
Breast cancer
Colon cancer
Prostate cancer
Ovarian cancer
Uterine cancer
Melanoma (a type of skin cancer)
Pancreatic cancer
Family members share genes and may, therefore, share cancer gene mutations. Relatives with the same cancer gene mutation usually share an increased risk to get cancer. Sometimes, a single gene mutation that increases the risk for cancer can increase the risk for more than one type of cancer."

Evidence:"The role of vaccines has been questioned, along with other possible risk factors for ASD, such as genetic predisposition, advanced parental age, and other environmental factors. Vaccines have perhaps received more scrutiny than any other speculated cause of ASD, and most scientists, physicians, and public health researchers have come to the conclusion that there is no association between vaccines and autism. [6] Some, however, still question whether vaccines play a role in ASD development. And so, public health and medical establishments continue to address these concerns. The MMR HypothesisThe story of how vaccines were questioned as a cause of autism dates back to the 1990s. In 1995, a group of British researchers published a cohort study in the Lancet showing that individuals who had been vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) were more likely to have bowel disease than individuals who had not received MMR."

“I bought one because I have muscle pain in my arm and the bracelets help with the pain and tension”
“I do suffer from arthritus and although the bracelet doesn’t take the pain away completely the bracelets help with the arthritis pain.”
“The reason I bought one is because I suffer with rheumatism and the copper magnetic arthritis wrist band helps with the pain. I remember searching for bracelets for rheumatism and a lot of choices came up. I know I am not the only who has found magnetic bracelets helpful.”

Evidence:"The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness."

Evidence:"Of all the things I'd done in my life—and I've done some really odd stuff—I realized I'd never had a sip of my own urine...it wasn't that bad." Functional medicine practitioner Will Cole, D.C., IFMCP, isn't too shocked about urotherapy's (albeit, hushed) popularity. "Urine is comprised of 95 percent water, 2.5 percent urea and 2.5 percent a mix of salt, enzymes, hormones, and minerals," he says. "Because of these properties found in urine, it makes sense why one would assume there would be benefits to reusing these nutrients and chemicals in the body for antiviral and antibacterial purposes as well as helping to balance hormones. "But does it have merit in the modern world?The answer is—a resounding maybe.

Evidence:"Some people find pink salt to be more flavorful than table salt. When in its coarse form, pink salt has less sodium per teaspoon, which may cause people to use less salt for seasoning, reducing their sodium intake. Table salt often contains additives such as anti-caking agents, so some people may prefer Himalayan salt because it is free from additives. And choosing this salt simply because of its fun pink color is a fine reason to buy it, too. It is perfectly healthy to use Himalayan pink salt as a substitute for conventional table salt.

Evidence:"In addition, not every man, woman, or child who gets a UTI has typical UTI symptoms, but most do exhibit at least one or more signs of infection. And when men do get UTIs, their symptoms are generally not too different from those that women experience. Common UTI symptoms include: (1)Frequent urinationA strong, constant urge to urinateReleasing only small amounts of urine at a timeCloudy, bloody, or bad-smelling urineSuprapubic (lower abdominal) painBurning or pain during urinationAny of these symptoms accompanied by lower back pain, fever, nausea, or chills could indicate a kidney infection — a serious problem that needs prompt treatment.RELATED: The Link Between UTIs and Sex: Causes and How to Prevent ThemHow UTIs in Men Are DiagnosedA urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria (or, less commonly, a virus or even a fungus) enters the urinary tract. In fact, according to the National Kidney Foundation, one particular bacteria, E. coli, causes 80 to 90 percent of all UTI cases. (5)Diagnosing a urinary tract infection in men is initially the same as it is for women, consisting of a urine culture. But because a UTI in a man is often considered complicated, according to Dr. Trost, additional testing is usually necessary to determine why he got a UTI.“This typically includes not only a urinary culture to confirm an infection, but also a special study to evaluate how much urine he leaves behind after urinating, and an imaging study, such as a CT [computerized tomography] scan, to evaluate for kidney stones or other anatomic abnormalities that may be causing this,” he explains.If a man has recurrent infections or infections with the same organism, or UTI-like symptoms without a positive urine culture, then further testing may be necessary.Any man who suspects he may have a UTI should see his doctor right away so that he can begin treatment as soon as possible.RELATED: Vegetarian Diet Linked to Lowered Risk Of Urinary Tract InfectionHow Urinary Tract Infections Are Treated in MenWhether an infection affects a man or a woman, the treatment is the same: a round of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and get rid of UTI symptoms."

Although carrots do contain nutrients important for our eyes, eating more most likely won’t provide you with a vision boost. We can trace the idea of carrots being good for vision back to World War II, when the U.K. Ministry of Food pushed out a propaganda campaign saying that the secret to the British Air Force’s success over German aircraft was a diet rich in carrots.

Evidence:"MRIs in early pregnancy appear safe, but contrast agent may not be | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upHealthcare & PharmaUpdated MRIs in early pregnancy appear safe, but contrast agent may not beBy Kathryn Doyle, Reuters Health5 Min Read(Reuters Health) - In the critical first trimester of pregnancy, undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without a contrast agent is not associated with any negative outcomes for the baby, according to a new study.But when the expectant mother has an MRI with gadolinium contrast, a material that makes it easier to see internal structures like blood vessels in the brain, risk for stillbirth, neonatal death or the child having any of several serious health conditions may rise, researchers say.“We know that MRI is actually being encouraged as the main high fidelity method of imaging in women of reproductive age,” since it does not involve radiation, and produces outstanding images of deeper cavities that ultrasound can’t get at, said lead author Dr. Joel Ray of St. Michael’s Hospital and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto.The new results “invigorate or support” what most people believed by intuition or smaller datasets: that non-contrast MRI is generally safe for pregnant women, Ray told Reuters Health.With contrast MRIs, negative outcomes are still very rare but it may be a good idea to avoid these MRIs in pregnancy, or when a woman may be pregnant, he said.The researchers analyzed more than 1 million births between 2003 and 2013 in Ontario, Canada, using universal healthcare databases. About one in 250 women had undergone an MRI during pregnancy, one in 1,200 during the first trimester and one in 3,000 with gadolinium contrast. Health of the babies was followed from birth until they were 4 years old.Having an MRI during the first trimester was not tied to an increased risk of stillbirth, newborn death, cancer, congenital defects or hearing loss in the children.Only 397 women had gadolinium contrast MRIs during pregnancy, compared to more than 1.4 million without any MRI in this comparison.Connective tissue or infiltrating skin conditions like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were about 36 percent more common in babies born to the gadolinium group than the no-MRI group, according to the results in JAMA. More broadly, rheumatological and inflammatory conditions were similarly increased by about 45 cases per 1,000 children per year.There were seven stillbirths or newborn deaths in the gadolinium group compared to 9,844 in the no-MRI group, so while still rare, these outcomes were twice as common in the gadolinium group, the authors note.An adult body processes and clears gadolinium contrast materials through the urine, but a fetus exposed via the placenta will continually urinate and ingest the same material in the amniotic fluid until birth, Ray said.“The theory was that you can recirculate gadolinium over and over again, and this brings that theory a little bit closer to a clinical point,” he said.Gadolinium can usually be avoided during pregnancy, but “in a woman who is pregnant, if she really needs gadolinium then she’s the priority,” he said.“Potential risk versus benefit should always be assessed when an imaging study is recommended,” said Dr. Dorothy Bulas, professor of pediatrics and radiology at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. “This study is reassuring and helps support the use of MRI at any gestation if there is a valid indication for the exam,” she said by email.“The study also supports the need to avoid gadolinium in the pregnant patient unless the maternal benefits truly outweigh the potential fetal risks that were noted in this large study cohort,” Bulas added.Current contrast media guidelines already incorporate appropriate safety concerns, said Dr. Karen Oh of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland, who was not part of the new study.“Doctors should continue to provide appropriate prenatal care and utilize MRI when indicated; and women should ask and receive explanations for indications for studies during pregnancy, have their questions answered appropriately, so that they can feel comfortable with the care they are receiving,” Oh told Reuters Health by email.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Evidence:"Four: the number of times HIV jumped from chimp to human. HIV likely arose from blood contact when humans handled bushmeat from SIV-infected apes. In some ways it’s surprising that HIV’s chimp precursor hasn’t cropped up more often, said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Michael Emerman. The birth of SIVcpz “was a very unusual event, because it only happened one time that we know of in evolutionary history,” said Emerman, who studies the viral, chimp and human evolutionary steps that ultimately allowed HIV to come into the world. “And we know that there are lots of exposures, because chimpanzees eat a lot of monkeys and a lot of these monkeys have their own version of these SIVs.”
In a study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Pathogens, Emerman and his colleagues describe their findings on the chimp genes that may normally protect chimps from monkey-borne SIVs — and could be the critical immune blockade that was breached only once, when SIVcpz arose. Emerman led the study along with Dr. Lucie Etienne, a former Fred Hutch postdoctoral fellow who now leads a virology research team at the International Center for Infectiology Research in Lyon, France."

Evidence:"The toxins fall on the rock, and clean water vapor remains in the air. However, this claim also has little evidence to support it.What are the supposed health benefits and does any evidence support them?Here are the most common health claims associated with pink Himalayan salt lamps and the evidence behind them:Air purificationShare on PinterestSome people use pink Himalayan salt lamps as air purifiers, though no research supports this use.Many people claim that salt lamps purify the air of a person’s home or office. This is specifically useful to those with allergies to dust, insect droppings, animal dander, or other environmental allergies.Salt lamps may also benefit people with respiratory problems, such as asthma.However, there is little evidence to suggest that salt lamps remove allergens or germs from the air. Additionally, there is no concrete proof that salt lamps improve air quality.Ease respiratory symptomsAnother major claim from salt lamp makers is that these products help reduce respiratory symptoms in those with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is due in part to the salt lamp’s ability to remove irritants.Not only can a person use a salt lamp, but they can also purchase a Himalayan salt inhaler online or at a drug store.The notion of inhaling Himalayan salt comes from the ancient practice of halotherapy, in which people with asthma would spend time in salt caves. Apparently, breathing in tiny salt particles can help clear the airways and break down mucus.There are some studies that look at the effectiveness of salt therapy for asthma and COPD, but they are not high-quality."

Yes, it's possible to get pregnant any time from about three weeks after giving birth. This is true even if you're breastfeeding and haven't had a period yet. Many women are less fertile while they're breastfeeding, especially in the early weeks and months. This is because breastfeeding reduces your levels of certain hormones (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and luteinising hormone), which are needed for ovulation and pregnancy. The more your baby breastfeeds, the lower your hormone levels will be, and the less likely you are to become pregnant. If your baby is under six months and exclusively breastfeeding day and night, your chances of conception are low."

Evidence:"The Food and Drug Administration released a warning in 2012 about cases of apparent short-term cognitive impairment with statin use, while acknowledging that the cardiovascular benefits outweigh their risks. However, systematic reviews have shown insufficient evidence on the impact of statins and research has shown mixed results, with some showing a neurocognitive benefit of statins and others reporting a null effect. According to the researchers of this study, since statins are widely used among older adults and expected to increase in use, determining the effects of statin therapy on cognition in older individuals is vital to help clinicians weigh their benefits against associated risks. “With statins being increasingly prescribed to older adults, their potential long-term effects on cognitive decline and dementia risk have attracted growing interest,” said Zhen Zhou, PhD, Menzies Institute for Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia and lead author of the study. “The present study adds to previous research by suggesting that statin use at baseline was not associated with subsequent dementia incidence and long-term cognitive decline in older adults.” Researchers of this study analyzed data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. ASPREE was a large prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial of daily low-dose aspirin, which included 19,114 participants 65 years old or older with no prior CVD event, dementia or major physical disability, between 2010 and 2014 from Australia and the U.S. One of the key selection criteria of ASPREE was that participants had to have a score of <78 for the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination test, a screening test for cognitive abilities, at enrollment."

The average American gets the common cold two to three times a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are tons of cold virus strains, which means you’re at risk of catching a new one all the time. The general advice for avoiding the common cold is plenty of hand-washing, and the best methods involve soaping your hands for at least 20 seconds. In addition, it’s wise to avoid touching your face throughout the day so you don’t introduce the virus to your eyes, nose, and mouth."

Evidence:"If you ate hot dogs and bologna regularly as a kid (many of us did), that doesn’t automatically mean you’re doomed to develop colon cancer. However, if you ate lots of processed meat, very little vegetables and fruit, and grew up never exercising, that combination of bad habits will likely increase your risk for developing colon cancer. The risk increases further if you have a genetic disposition for the disease.That said, our lifelong dietary habits do affect our health as we age. You may have some cellular-level damage to your colon from years of eating processed meats. The chemicals in processed meat coat your colon and damage the cells. These damaged cells then duplicate, which can cause cancer.Reducing your intake of processed meats now can help prevent further damage and reduce your risk for developing colon cancer."

Evidence:"There is no evidence to suggest that common skin tags are contagious. While classic skin tags are typically very characteristic in appearance and occur in specific locations such as the underarms, necks, under breasts, eyelids and groin folds, there are tags that may occur in less obvious locations.Other skin growths that may look similar to a skin tag but are not tags include moles (dermal nevus), nerve and fiber-type moles (neurofibromas), warts, and "barnacles" or the so-called "Rice Krispies" (seborrheic keratoses).Warts tend to have a "warty" irregular surface whereas skin tags are usually smooth. Warts tend to be flat whereas tags are more like bumps hanging from thin stalk. While warts are almost entirely caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), tags are rarely associated with HPV.Groin and genital skin lesions resembling skin tags may actually be genital warts or condyloma. A biopsy would help diagnose which of these growths are not skin tags."

Evidence:"Could help reduce bad breathHalitosis, also known as bad breath, is a condition that affects an estimated 50% of the population (5).There are many potential causes of bad breath.Some of the most common include infection, gum disease, poor oral hygiene, and tongue coating, which is when bacteria become trapped on the tongue (9).Treatment typically includes the removal of the bacteria, either through brushing or by using an antiseptic mouthwash like chlorhexidine (10).Interestingly, one 2011 study found that oil pulling was as effective as chlorhexidine at reducing bad breath.In the study, 20 children rinsed with either chlorhexidine or sesame oil, both of which caused a significant decrease in levels of the microorganisms known to contribute to bad breath (11).Though more research is needed, oil pulling may be used as a natural alternative to reduce bad breath and could be as effective as traditional treatments.3. May help prevent cavitiesCavities are a common problem that stems from tooth decay.Poor oral hygiene, eating too much sugar, and a buildup of bacteria can all cause tooth decay, which leads to the formation of holes in the teeth known as cavities (4).Plaque can also cause cavities. Plaque forms a coating on teeth and is comprised of bacteria, saliva, and food particles. The bacteria begin to break down the food particles, forming an acid that destroys tooth enamel and causes tooth decay (4).Several studies have found that oil pulling can help reduce the number of bacteria in the mouth, preventing tooth decay.In fact, some research has found that oil pulling may decrease the number of harmful bacteria found in saliva and plaque as effectively as a mouthwash (7, 8).Decreasing these strains of bacteria through oil pulling could help prevent tooth decay and reduce the risk of cavity formation.4. Seems to reduce inflammation and improve gum healthGingivitis is a type of gum disease marked by red, swollen gums that bleed easily.The bacteria found in plaque are a major cause of gingivitis, as they can cause bleeding and inflammation in the gums (12).Fortunately, oil pulling may be an effective remedy to improve gum health and reduce inflammation.It works primarily by decreasing the harmful bacteria and plaque in the mouth that contribute to gum disease, such as Streptococcus mutans.Using certain oils with anti-inflammatory properties like coconut oil may also aid by reducing the inflammation associated with gum disease (13).In one study, 60 participants with gingivitis began oil pulling with coconut oil for 30 days. After 1 week, they had reduced amounts of plaque and showed an improvement in gum health (14).Another older study in 20 boys with gingivitis compared the effectiveness of oil pulling with sesame oil and a standard mouthwash.Both groups showed a decrease in plaque, an improvement in gingivitis, and a reduction in the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth (15).While more evidence is needed, these findings suggest that oil pulling may be an effective supplementary treatment to prevent plaque formation and promote healthy gums.5."

Evidence:"The current trend of increasing numbers of newly marketed grapefruit-affected drugs possessing substantial adverse clinical effects necessitates an understanding of this interaction and the application of this knowledge for the safe and effective use of drugs in general practice.Key points
Currently, more than 85 drugs have the possibility of interacting with grapefruit; of these drugs, 43 have interactions that can result in serious adverse effects. Drugs that interact with grapefruit have all of the following characteristics: they are administered orally, they have very low to intermediate absolute bioavailability, and they are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4). All sources of grapefruit and certain related citrus fruits can irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4 in the gastrointestinal tract; to prevent this interaction, affected drugs should not be consumed with any of these fruits during the treatment period, or noninteracting alternative medications should be prescribed. Older patients have the greatest possibility of ingesting grapefruit and interacting medications and are the most vulnerable to the adverse clinical consequences.Supplementary Material

      Using e-cigarettes to stop smoking
In recent years, e-cigarettes have become a very popular stop smoking aid in the UK.Also known as vapes or e-cigs, they're far less harmful than cigarettes, and can help you quit smoking for good.They are not recommended for non-smokers and cannot be sold to people under 18 years old.What are e-cigarettes and how do they work?An e-cigarette is a device that allows you to inhale nicotine in a vapour rather than smoke.E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco and do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most damaging elements in tobacco smoke.They work by heating a liquid (called an e-liquid) that typically contains nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine, and flavourings.Using an e-cigarette is known as vaping.Will vaping help me stop smoking?Many thousands of people in the UK have already stopped smoking with the help of an e-cigarette. There's evidence that they can be effective.A 2021 review found people who used e-cigarettes to quit smoking, as well as having expert face-to-face support, can be up to twice as likely to succeed as people who used other nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum.Using an e-cigarette can help you manage your nicotine cravings. To get the best out of it, make sure you're using it as much as you need to and with the right strength of nicotine in your e-liquid.You will not get the full benefit from vaping unless you stop smoking cigarettes completely.Getting expert help from your local Stop Smoking Service gives you the best chance of quitting smoking for good.Find your local Stop Smoking ServiceHow do I choose the right e-cigarette for me?There are different types of e-cigarette, including vape pens, vape bars, pod devices, mods, and cigalikes. They can be rechargeable or disposable.It's also important to choose the right strength of nicotine in your e-liquid, which will depend on how much you smoke. You can get advice on models and e-liquids from a specialist vape shop.Find out more about e-cigarettes, e-liquids and vaping to quit smoking on the Better Health website.How safe are e-cigarettes?In the UK, e-cigarettes are tightly regulated for safety and quality.Vaping is not completely risk-free, but it poses a small fraction of the risk of smoking cigarettes. The long-term risks of vaping are not yet clear.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at a much lower level.What about risks from nicotine?While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, most of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Are e-cigarettes safe to use in pregnancy?Little research has been conducted into the safety of e-cigarettes and e-liquids in pregnancy."

Evidence:"However, eating too many bananas can cause trouble for people with diabetes due to their higher carbohydrate counts, which may lead to blood sugar swings. When eaten to excess, bananas may also cause digestion issues such as bloating, gas, and upset stomach. They may contribute to sleepiness and weight gain, and the sweetness of bananas may contribute to dental health issues such as cavities and gum disease. Unripe bananas have the fewest number of carbohydrates and calories, and contain the highest levels of both pectin and resistant starch, while still having the high amounts of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that ripe bananas have. This may be the best choice for people with diabetes who want to incorporate bananas into their daily diet. Moderation is key, so if you choose to incorporate bananas into your diet, work with your doctor and/or nutritionist to find a balanced way to add this healthy fruit into your meal plan, with keeping your diabetes and health goals in mind."

Evidence:"They believe that consuming apple cider vinegar makes it easier to lose weight, and may even improve their metabolic health. Is there any truth to this idea? Let’s look at what science has found so far about apple cider vinegar and its potential weight loss benefits.How Apple Cider Vinegar Might Enhance Weight LossStudies show that apple cider vinegar modestly lowers the rise in glucose you get after eating a food. With apple cider vinegar on board, your glucose doesn’t rise as much after a meal, and your body doesn’t need to make as much insulin. When there’s less insulin around, your body can more easily break down fat and is less likely to store it, leading to weight gain. Another way to look at it is apple cider vinegar improves insulin sensitivity, which is good for your waistline and metabolic health."

Evidence:"It is particularly popular in traditional Asian and Arabic medicines. Many people use ginger supplements when treating nausea, although fresh, dried, and crystallized ginger may also help soothe nausea when consumed as foods or spices. While it's not known how ginger might ease nausea, some scientists suspect that certain chemicals found in ginger may influence the nervous system, stomach, and intestines to help reduce nausea. Steven Morris Photography / Getty Images 
   The Science Behind Ginger and Nausea  
Ginger for nausea works directly on the stomach and is thought to increase the movement of the GI tract. A 2005 report from Obstetrics and Gynecology analyzed six clinical trials (with a total of 675 participants) and found that ginger was superior to a placebo and similar to vitamin B6 in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.﻿﻿
In addition, in a 2006 report from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, investigators sized up five clinical trials (with a total of 363 patients) and concluded that taking ginger is more effective than placebo for post-surgery nausea and vomiting.﻿﻿
In 2012, another study reported in Integrated Cancer Therapy found that ginger was effective in reducing nausea caused by chemotherapy. Ginger was administered to women being treated for advanced breast cancer; the study found that " A significantly lower prevalence of nausea was observed in the ginger group during 6 to 24 hours post chemotherapy."
