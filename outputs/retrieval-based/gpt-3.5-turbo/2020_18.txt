Evidence:"However, vitamin D is also known to help the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses. Shutterstock
Vitamin D's effect on Covid-19 may be exaggerated. Here's what we know
      Research has shown that vitamin D deficiency impairs the immune system, and some studies have found vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of respiratory virus infections and calm immune system overreaction. During the early days of the pandemic, physicians on the front lines began noticing people with lower levels of vitamin D appeared to have a higher risk of dying from Covid-19. Suddenly, the internet was flooded with speculation that taking supplemental doses of vitamin D – even if not needed – would prevent the coronavirus from taking hold. However, “unlike vitamin C, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can ‘build up’ in the system and cause toxicity if taken at very high doses over long periods,” Martineau explained."

Evidence:"Lastly, oral polio vaccination showed no significant association to COVID-19 outcomes [34].DiscussionSummary of the findingsOverall, most studies indicate an inverse association between BCG vaccination policies and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. However, this review presents a different finding from the study done by Ricco et al. early on in the pandemic, which previously concluded that there is no sound evidence to recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19 [38]. Findings may result from the inclusion of more recent studies on the topic, including those from early to mid-2021 [30, 32, 34, 35]. For one, Ricco et al. report that only two out of the 14 studies reviewed controlled for confounding variables."

Evidence:"Please support this special project, so we can continue to tell stories that matter. Thank you – Team WebQoof)A long text message that has gone viral on the internet claims that German scientists have found that we can stop the novel coronavirus from reaching our lungs by "gargling with a semi-hot solution of salt and water" several times a day. The claim goes on to say that by following this practice, an alkaline environment would be created in the mouths, which would prevent the COVID-19 virus from multiplying. However, we found that the claims made in the viral post were false. We didn't find any such recommendations made by German scientists. Additionally, claims like gargling with hot water kills COVID-19 and that the virus is sensitive to changing pH had gone viral at the beginning of the pandemic and have resurfaced amid rising cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant.ADVERTISEMENTCLAIMThe viral claim starts by saying, "German scientists announced, after a series of studies, that the Coronavirus not only reproduces in the lungs like the SARS virus in 2002, but also spreads widely in the throat during the first week of infection."

Evidence:"How the pneumococcal vaccine works
Both types of pneumococcal vaccine encourage your body to produce antibodies against pneumococcal bacteria.Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralise or destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins.They protect you from becoming ill if you're infected with the bacteria.More than 90 different strains of the pneumococcal bacterium have been identified, although most of these strains do not cause serious infections.The childhood vaccine (PCV) protects against 13 strains of the pneumococcal bacterium, while the adult vaccine (PPV) protects against 23 strains. Effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine
Children respond very well to the pneumococcal vaccine.The introduction of this vaccine into the NHS childhood vaccination schedule has resulted in a large reduction in pneumococcal disease.The pneumococcal vaccine given to older children and adults is thought to be around 50 to 70% effective at preventing pneumococcal disease.Both types of pneumococcal vaccine are inactivated or "killed" vaccines and do not contain any live organisms. They cannot cause the infections they protect against. Find out more about why vaccination is safe and important
Who should not have the pneumococcal vaccine
Occasionally, you or your child may need to delay having the pneumococcal vaccine or avoid it completely.Vaccine allergyTell your GP if you or your child has had a bad reaction to any vaccination in the past.If there's been a confirmed severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the pneumococcal vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine, it may not be possible for you to have it.But if it was only a mild reaction, such as a rash, it's generally safe to have the vaccine.Fever at the vaccination appointmentIf you or your child are mildly unwell at the time of the vaccination, it's safe to have the vaccine.But if you or your child are more seriously ill (for example, with a high temperature and feeling hot and shivery), it's best to delay the vaccination until after recovery.Pregnancy and breastfeedingHaving the pneumococcal vaccine is thought to be safe during pregnancy and while you're breastfeeding.But as a precaution, you may want to wait until you’ve had your baby if you're pregnant, unless the benefits of having the vaccine outweigh the risks to your child. Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine
Like most vaccines, the childhood and adult versions of the pneumococcal vaccine can sometimes cause mild side effects.These include:a slightly raised temperatureredness where the injection was givenhardness or swelling where the injection was givenThere are no serious side effects listed for either the childhood or adult versions of the vaccine, apart from an extremely rare risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).

Evidence:"A recent study takes a fresh look at the connection between the hormone and COVID-19 outcomes. Their findings appear in the journal BMJ Open.The study’s senior author, Dr. Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, a clinical research fellow at Umeå University, told Medical News Today: “The results of this particular study showed that postmenopausal women taking estrogen had a lower risk of death from COVID-19 than those who were not taking supplemental estrogen. It’s an intriguing result that definitely warrants further study. For example, earlier research investigating possible treatments for COVID-19 also cited estrogen as a potential therapeutic agent.” A previous study found that females have a lower risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team also found that older females who were taking or had taken hormone therapy were less likely to have the infection than age-matched females who had never taken hormone therapy. These and similar findings have led some scientists to ask whether estrogen could play a role in future treatment options."

Evidence:"That is why it is critical for people to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19, especially given the possibility that there are people who have the coronavirus in their bodies and can spread it, but are not showing any symptoms. Theseexperiments prove that wearing a mask is effective at reducing the spread ofdroplets, and complements safe distancing measures. Leave your home only whenabsolutely necessary, and put on a mask securely, when you do. If you are illbut asymptomatic, the mask protects others from you, when you are out andabout.

We searched PubMed to identify all relevant clinical and laboratory studies published up to 15 May 2020; the guidelines on the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 were further directly searched on the website of the main international scientific societies and agencies. Available evidence is currently scarce and of low quality. The recommendations issued for COVID-19 vary from positions clearly against the use of LPV/r to other positions that are more favorable. In our opinion, despite the controversial results of an important randomized clinical trial, and some recommendations, clinicians should not abandon the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19, possibly using this drug inside a prospective randomized trial, waiting for the results of the numerous ongoing trials evaluating its efficacy.

Evidence:"Curcumin from turmeric
•Study shows lower SARS-CoV-2 mortality among physically active individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa
A recent study published in the journal Computers in Biology and Medicine demonstrated that the phytochemical curcumin is a potent therapeutic prospect against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 508 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and six million deaths to date globally. As of now, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is the dominant strain worldwide. Omicron was designated a variant of concern (VOC) since it can evade vaccine- and infection-induced immunity due to several mutations in its spike (S) protein, including 15 amino acid substitutions across the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Recent studies indicate that many of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccinations offer little or no immunity against Omicron infection."

Evidence:"The effect of ACEIs/ARBs use on COVID-19 patients has been a controversial topic since the beginning of this pandemic, and some studies even have interposed a risk of taking ACEIs/ARBs using data from previous coronavirus outbreaks and preclinical studies (99). Previously published systematic reviews suggested a lower mortality (25–43%) in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID19 (100–102). Furthermore, a large-scale retrospective study demonstrated that in-hospital use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with a lower risk of 28-day death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension (adjusted HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15–0.66) (80). These data suggested that patients with hypertension might obtain benefits from taking ACEIs/ARBs compared with the non-ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID-19 and support the hypothesis that a drug that diminishes angiotensin-2 activity, such as ACEIs and/or ARBs, can reduce the deadliness of inflammation associated injury in COVID-19. Our result trends in contraindicating the above study results but did not reach statistical significance. Our meta-analysis suggests that the use of ACEIs/ARBs neither increase nor decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The analysis identified that an enzyme (ABO) that determines blood group was causally associated with both an increased risk of hospitalisation and a requirement for respiratory support. This supports previous findings around the association of blood group with higher likelihood of death. Taken together with previous research showing that the proportion of group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests blood group A is candidate for follow-up studies. Co-last author Dr Christopher Hübel from King's IoPPN said, “The enzyme helps determine the blood group of an individual and our study has linked it with both risk of hospitalisation and the need of respiratory support or death. Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19 but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is more likely candidate for follow-up studies.”
What we have done in our study is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research. Out of 1000s of blood proteins we have whittled it down to about 14 that have some form of causal connection to the risk of severe COVID-19 and present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies.– Professor Gerome Breen, co-last author and Professor of Genetics at the IoPPN, King's College London
Assessing how blood proteins are linked to disease can help understand the underlying mechanisms and identify potential new targets for developing or repurposing drugs."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"On the other hand, a recent evidence review by London researchers suggests people who currently smoke may be less likely to be infected with coronavirus. One study suggests this could be because nicotine interferes with ACE2 receptors, which may prevent the virus from entering cells. The researchers said that more scientific research is needed to understand these mixed findings, as the link is still not clear. And this kind of study can’t show cause and effect – so we don’t know whether the association found is caused by smoking or something else that was different about smokers (for example smokers may have had a higher rate of exposure to Covid-19 for some reason). One paper claiming that smoking may reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection (from the University of Piraeus and University of Utah) was retracted after two of its authors were found to have ties to the tobacco industry. Regardless of whether smoking reduces the risk of catching coronavirus, we know it increases your risk of severe illness, hospitalisation and death if you do become infected."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"At day 14, 11 (16.4%) subjects assigned to HCQ and 6 (9.8%) subjects assigned to placebo met the severe disease progression end point, but this did not achieve statistical significance (P = .350). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 clinical scores, number of oxygen-free days, SARS-CoV-2 clearance, or adverse events between HCQ and placebo. HCQ was associated with a slight increase in mean corrected QT interval, an increased D-dimer, and a trend toward an increased length of stay.ConclusionsIn hospitalized patients with COVID-19, our data suggest that HCQ does not prevent severe outcomes or improve clinical scores. However, our conclusions are limited by a relatively small sample size, and larger randomized controlled trials or pooled analyses are needed. COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, randomized controlled trial, SARS-CoV-2Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute pneumonia syndrome caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is currently responsible for over 25 million infections and 850 000 deaths worldwide [1]. Effective therapies combating SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to prevent severe outcomes related to COVID-19.The antimalarial and immunomodulatory drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is one candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2."

Evidence:"If more intensive cleaning is required steam cleaning should be used.All consumables, such as opened toilet rolls or tissue boxes, should be discarded unless they can be cleaned.The room should be allowed to air dry before being used again.LinenCleaners should always take care when handling used linen and wear personal protective equipment (PPE) – see below section PPE for cleaners. Linen does not require special laundering but should be washed at the hottest possible temperature.Cleaning productsCleaning of hard surfaces should be done using either:a cleaning and disinfection procedure in two steps:  first clean with a detergent, then follow with a disinfectant listed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) with specific claims against COVID-19 or a 1:1,000PPM sodium hypochlorite solution.a 2-in-1 step process:  use a product that cleans and disinfects at the same time. Any hospital-grade TGA-listed disinfectant that has specific claims against COVID-19 is suitable if used according to manufacturer’s instructions.Disinfectant solutions should be made fresh daily and gloves should be worn when handling and preparing solutions.Cleaning equipment, including mop heads and cloths, should be laundered in hot water and completely dried before reuse.

Breastfeeding if you have COVID-19
If you have COVID-19 (coronavirus) and you are caring for your baby, you should continue to breastfeed as normal.There is no evidence that the virus passes through breast milk. But we are still learning about COVID-19. The main risk to your baby of getting the virus is being in close contact with you. You could pass it on through droplets when you cough or sneeze.You may decide to express breast milk so that someone else can feed your baby if you feel too unwell. This is usually your partner or a close family member. Do
wash your hands properly before touching your baby or any breastfeeding equipment like pumps or bottles
wear a face mask if you are doing breast or bottle feeds yourself
ask your midwife or other staff to show you how to clean the pump after each use
Treating symptoms when breastfeeding Avoid medicines that contain decongestants, for example Sudafed."

A vaccine will never get there. But this is an over-the-counter medication in most parts of the world,” he said.“I think people have to make up their own minds, and individual physicians will make their own decisions, but I think we’ve shown that anyone who presents with COVID symptoms should be given a steroid inhaler.”The research team, which is co-lead by University of Oxford Clinical Research Fellow and Edith Cowan University PhD candidate Sanjay Ramakrishnan, is preparing to look for more uses for the treatment which they believe has application for a range of diseases including many strains of the flu and even the common cold.“We’ve never had a good treatment for the common cold, it does make people sick, especially older people, and perhaps this could be it,” Professor Nicolau said.“These pandemics are now coming every five years or so, and this treatment should work for the next one, because hyper-inflammation is not particular to COVID, it happens with all respiratory infections.”*A previous version of this story stated that the steroid inhalers were available over the counter."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The video added that Omega-3 could control the flu and inflammation caused by the virus. The source said the coronavirus was similar to the cold and flu virus in terms of inflammation. Therefore, this acid could be effective in treating Covid-19. Another website “World of Economics” published an article titled: “Protect your body against coronavirus with this advice.”
One of the key factors is protein, which is essential for the functioning of the immune system and it is recommended to use low-fat dairy, a variety of meats such as red and white meat, due to its high Omega-3, fish oil reduced inflammation in the body and it is better to eat it twice a week. IRNA, another Iranian media outlet, also reported: “Higher levels of Omega-3 in the blood reduce the risk of death from coronavirus.”
But media experts say that Omega-3 pills have not been proved to be effective in treating the coronavirus. Dr. Baz Mohammad Sherzad, a former advisor to the Ministry of Public Health, told Pajhwok Afghan News the use of multivitamins, Omega-3, probiotics or vitamin-D supplements may reduce the risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test."

MESOBLAST TO EVALUATE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CELL THERAPY REMESTEMCEL-L FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19 LUNG DISEASE
Melbourne, Australia; March 10, 2020; and New York, USA; March 9, 2020: Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq: MESO; ASX:MSB) today announced that it plans to evaluate its allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) product candidate remestemcel-L in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, Australia, China and Europe. The Company is in active discussions with various government and regulatory authorities, medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies to implement these activities. Mortality in COVID-19 infected patients with the inflammatory lung condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is reported to approach 50%, and is associated with older age, co-morbidities such as diabetes, higher disease severity, and elevated markers of inflammation.1 Current therapeutic interventions do not appear to be improving in-hospital survival.1 
Remestemcel-L has potential for use in the treatment of ARDS, which is the principal cause of death in COVID-19 infection.1 This is supported by recently published results from an investigator-initiated clinical study conducted in China which reported that allogeneic MSCs cured or significantly improved functional outcomes in all seven treated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.2 
Additionally, in post-hoc analyses of a 60-patient randomized controlled study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), remestemcel-L infusions were well tolerated, significantly reduced inflammatory biomarkers, and significantly improved pulmonary function in those patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Since the same inflammatory biomarkers are also elevated in COVID-19, these data suggest that remestemcel-L could be useful in the treatment of patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. The COPD study results have been submitted for presentation at an international conference, with full results to be submitted for publication shortly. Remestemcel-L is being studied in numerous clinical trials across several inflammatory conditions, including in elderly patients with lung disease and adults and children with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).3-5  This product candidate is currently being reviewed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for potential approval in the treatment of children with steroid-refractory aGVHD."

Could Echinacea Purpurea Be Used To Prevent Respiratory Tract Infections?￼18/08/2022 |

Echinacea purpurea flowers. (Photo by Prof. Wim Vanden Berghe). Two years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV-2, various new waves of COVID-19 have swept across Europe. This has been driven by new variants due to the lifting of restrictions and increased social mixing, which will likely further increase in the autumn and winter months as schools reopen and people return from vacation. This could again place a huge burden on healthcare systems throughout the world, which are already under enormous pressure from dealing with the previous COVID-19 waves. Our researchers have been searching for ways to lower this COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems."
