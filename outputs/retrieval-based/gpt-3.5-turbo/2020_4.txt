Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Its publication may have played a part in an explosion of vitamin C supplement sales in the country, where Chinese e-commerce giant, JD reported a five-fold increase​​ in consumer purchases.Sales of health products including vitamin C effervescent tablets, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) brand Banlangen, and Xiao Chaihu (herbal formula) saw big increases.JD said the virus outbreak was the cause of the surge consumption, and its higher online sales was attributed to consumers preferring to order delivery online instead of going to supermarket to purchase products.Unlikely to cure COVID-19​However, in a separate article, Peter McCaffery, professor of biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen questioned the use of high-dose vitamin C in the treatment of COVID-19.Writing in The Conversation​, ​the professor said that while vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it’s unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection – or have a large effect at all.Referring to the clinical trials that used high doses of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, he said that even if IV vitamin C worked to shorten or cure COVID-19, it would likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, took over.“The most effective way to avoid the virus still remains washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and keeping your distance from anyone exhibiting symptoms,”​ he added.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Specifically, the study indicated that BGC vaccinated healthcare workers were less likely to suffer COVID-19 related symptoms (fatigue, dry cough, and muscle aches), were associated to have a reduced rate of testing positive either with a COVID-19 diagnosis by a medical doctor or a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and had a significantly lower positive serology against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) (62). Overall, these finding suggest that BCG vaccination may mitigate sickness associated with COVID-19 infection and ongoing clinical trials are aimed at specifically address this question. Since the BCG vaccine has proven protection against viral respiratory infections, several laboratories are exploring the possibility that the BCG vaccine could be used alone or synergistically to reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Nowadays, around 20 controlled randomized clinical trials ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, Germany, Greece, the United States, Egypt, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Denmark, and France (Table 1) to evaluate whether the BCG vaccine decreases the incidence and the severity of COVID-19. The importance of establishing age groups that might be protected against SARS-CoV2 infection by BCG-vaccination is evident, as well as the timing of the vaccine before potential exposure to the virus, as this may determine whether the BCG-vaccine is effective. This represents a critical step to assess the potential of BCG-vaccination to protect the elderly against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infectious agents."
Question:Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that “the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.”
For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are multiple over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. FDA suggests speaking to your health care professional if you are concerned about taking NSAIDs and rely on these medications to treat chronic diseases. FDA advises the public to read the full Drug Facts Label on OTC medications prior to use. OTC medications are safe and effective when you follow the directions on the label and/or as directed by your health care professional."
Question:Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"That’s false, according to Capt. Terra Forward, chief of Fort Leonard Wood’s Department of Public Health. “While gargling salt water may sooth a sore throat, it won’t work to stop infection with COVID-19 or any other virus,” she said. “Interestingly, this myth was spread on social media as a cure for SARS, MERS, and Zika as well, but there is no evidence that gargling warm water with salt or a vinegar solution prevents any viral infection.”
Whether spread intentionally or not, COVID-19 misinformation is harmful to individual and public health, Forward said. Knowing where to find accurate information is important as the way people get information continues to change. It seems it’s fairly easy for bad information to spread, both in speed and scale, due to how a message is written and the nature of where people get most of their news these days."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Aziz called ginger the best remedy against Covid and urged the people not to forget using ginger. Heath experts: ginger’s efficiency has no scientific basis. Dr. Hashmatullah Faizi, a senior official of the Afghan-Japan Covid-19 Hospital in Kabul, told Pajhwok: “Ginger is a herbal that we recommend to patients after the outbreak of the virus.”
He said ginger had anti-inflammatory nature and boost the immunity and effective in treatment of Covid. But he said that the efficiency of the ginger was yet to be proven against Covid-19. Dr. Mohammad Hashim Wahaj, director of Wahaj private hospital, told Pajhwok no research had so far been done over the effectiveness of ginger against Covid. “Although ginger is a nutritious food and is used both as flavoring and medicine, researchers in the world have warned that some people should be careful in its consumption it may have side effects and even dangerous consequences.”
According to him, with all the things that ginger has, it may harm the patients nerve system and brain."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"While typically harmless, this bacterium is well known for causing pneumonia and other diseases, often in interaction with viruses. This new Kaiser Permanente study provides evidence that these bacterial-viral interactions may play out in ways that shape the course of COVID-19. While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing COVID-19, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine. In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection. This study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1 to July 22, 2020. Among that population, 3,677 had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 1,075 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 334 died from COVID-19."

Evidence:"CONCLUSIONS
This study provides indirect epidemiologic evidence on the effects of female sex hormones on the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Female sex hormones were not associated with the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we showed that HT use was not associated with the clinical outcomes. Our findings could assist in the effective allocation of valuable health care resources and patient management during the current pandemic.REFERENCES

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Doctors ExplainNew research suggests that dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant, may not be the best choice.By Korin MillerPublished: May 4, 2020SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY//Getty ImagesAnother medication has made its way on the possible “do not take” list for coronavirus symptoms: dextromethorphan, an over-the-counter cough suppressant that is commonly used in cold medicines, especially cough syrup.A new research paper published in the journal Nature found that dextromethorphan might increase replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The coronavirus thrives when it’s able to replicate and hijack your cells, which can make you feel sicker.As a result, the researchers caution against using cough syrup and other cold and flu medicines that contain dextromethorphan specifically. However, the study was conducted on cells in a lab—not actual humans—and the authors added that more research is needed to understand which medications are truly safe to take.Given that a dry cough is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, these new findings are definitely raising eyebrows—but should you really be worried about your cough syrup? We asked doctors to break down the findings.What is dextromethorphan and how does it work?Cough syrups generally fall into two categories: suppressants, which help prevent you from coughing, and expectorants, which help you cough up phlegm."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Demands by rationalists to restrain Chakrapani and others from promoting dubious cures for COVID-19 infections have been ignored by the openly pro-Hindu government, which is committed to promoting Hindu beliefs and rituals. If anything, members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been extolling the virtues of cow urine. Suman Harpriya, a lawmaker in north-eastern Assam state, solemnly declared on 2 March in the provincial legislature that cow urine and cow dung could be used to treat COVID-19. Chakrapani’s rituals, which consisted of waving spoonfuls of cow urine at COVID-19, depicted as a half-lion half-man beast, were enthusiastically supported by trained bodyguards provided to him by the government. Images of the event received wide publicity and circulated online and shared on social media. Official commitment to research on cow urine and other bovine products was apparent in an advertisement released by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) on 14 February, calling for research proposals into ‘Scientific Utilisation through Research Augmentation of Prime Products from Indigenous Cows (SUTRA-PIC)’."
Question:Can drinking cow urine cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Social distancing is a beneficial practice for avoiding the spread of germs by maintaining a certain amount of space between you and those around you. In the case of COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping at least six feet of distance between yourself and anyone around you, particularly indoors. Social distancing greatly reduces the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 by minimizing the transfer of respiratory droplets from one person to another. Because some patients with COVID-19 can be completely asymptomatic, it is essential that social distancing and other safety measures are practiced, regardless of whether or not a person is showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The symptoms of coronavirus can vary from person to person, with some infected patients being completely asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms and even life-threatening complications."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Myth #1: Sun exposure can protect you from COVID-19While sunlight does contain UV light, it’s mostly UVA and UVB light. These types of UV light are less effective at killing SARS-CoV-2. Perhaps more importantly, prolonged exposure can also lead to skin damage, sunburn, or even skin cancer.Myth #2: Using a UV lamp on your body can protect you from COVID-19While a UV lamp may be used to disinfect surfaces, avoid using one to kill the new coronavirus on your hands or other parts of your body. Remember, most types of UV light can be harmful to people. Exposure can result in skin irritation, damage, or burns.Myth #3: Sitting in a hot bath can prevent COVID-19This method won’t prevent you from becoming ill with COVID-19. In fact, your body temperature will remain pretty much the same in a hot bath."

                            A randomised-controlled trial that is awaiting peer review suggests that Covid-19 patients who received a combination of honey and Nigella sativa recovered more quickly than those given a placebo. Treatment with honey and Nigella sativa (also known as black cumin) was found to alleviate Covid-19 symptoms within six days, compared to 13 days in the control group.In addition, subjects on the honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) treatment achieved a negative PCR test - used to diagnose Covid-19 - about four days earlier than subjects without the treatment.According to the researchers, this is the first such trial studying a combination of HNS in Covid-19 patients.The paper is published on the preprint server, medRxiv and has not yet been peer-reviewed yet.Dr Sohaib Ashraf, who is the principal investigator of this study, and a research fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA told NutraIngredients-Asia​: “When COVID-19 struck in late March, soon it was clear to us that this disease is going to cause havoc across the globe and will act as a reset button for world economy​.So, we ​searched for clinical trials published regarding proven efficacy of any drug against COVID-19 but unfortunately, we identified no drug proven effective against COVID-19. ​“We searched on scientific literature for any miracle drug that can be globally accessible with wide range efficacy against viruses and other microbes along with anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, anti-coagulant properties and wide range of safety profile. In that search, we found honey and Nigella sativa were a perfect fit.”​Researchers said both honey and Nigella sativa show similar pharmacological profiles with its anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory effects especially in upper respiratory tract infections.“We reasoned that the combination could be more effective in attenuating severity of the disease, controlling viral replication and curing COVID-19 patients​,” they wrote.Study design​The trial was conducted between May to July 2020 as an urgent study during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan.In total, 313 patients were enrolled in the RCT, and recruited from four medical care facilities in Lahore, Pakistan.210 subjects were categorised as moderate cases, identified by cough, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath, while 103 subjects were severe cases, identified by fever, cough, pneumonia, and respiratory distress.The subjects were randomised into the treatment or placebo group.In the treatment group, subjects were given honey (1g/kg/day) and Nigella sativa (80mg/kg/day) for up to 13 days.These were given two to three times a day depending on the patient’s comfort. Honey was dissolved in 250mL of warm water, while Nigella sativa was provided in capsules.Both honey and Nigella sativa were provided by Smile Welfare Organization, a non-profitable organisation based in Pakistan.The control group received empty capsules.In addition, all Covid-19 patients received standard care therapy as advised by the physician, comprising of anti-pyretic drugs, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation if required.Subjects were assessed for clinical symptoms daily for 13 days, and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests if found to remain asymptomatic for at least 48 hours.For patients who were discharged before day 13 or were home-quarantined, the follow-up was done by telemedicine.The primary outcomes were viral clearance (negative PCR test) and alleviation of symptoms."

Background
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2, continues to increase morbidity and mortality across the world. Mitigation strategies and vaccinations have declined the infection rate and severity; however, there are limited therapeutic options that are currently available for treating COVID-19. Traditional herbal medicines are a promising option for the complementary treatment of COVID-19. The rhizome of Curcuma longa, which is more commonly known as turmeric root, is one popular option that is associated with potent antiviral properties."

Evidence:"Vegetarian plant-based diets also strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress (14), and may help prevent chronic kidney disease and preserve kidney function (21). Hence, we propose the hypothesis that vegetarian diets might prevent heart and kidney diseases as well as strengthen the immune system and lower comorbidities. The presence of fewer comorbidities may influence the severity of COVID-19 indirectly.An epidemiologic prospective cohort study by Merino et al. (1) suggests that plant-based foods were associated with lower severity of COVID-19, especially in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. In our study, the hospital setting enrolled a more severe and critical COVID-19 population and when there was no COVID-19 vaccination during pandemics, our findings agree with the results of their study. However, we did not explore other supplements of Vitamin B12, D3, or blood tests in our study population because it was a retrospective study."

And that's a lot of medical resources, which are being used for influenza, which otherwise could be used to take care of patients with COVID-19 or other serious illnesses. The effects of the vaccine actually last a long time, for months. So now in the fall is really the perfect time to get vaccinated for the flu."

Evidence:"There have been some early indications that not stopping your ACE inhibitor or ARB is linked to better outcomes from Covid-19. In most cases so far, this research has involved looking at existing hospital or clinical trial data to study potential links. A study part-funded by the BHF looked at the healthcare records of 1200 patients who has been hospitalised with Covid-19 in London and found that being on ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not make the disease worse. Their data also showed that, in this particular group of people with Covid-19, those who were on ACE inhibitors or ARBs seemed to be less likely to die or need to be transferred to a critical care unit. More recently, researchers carried out a meta-analysis study (where data from multiple studies in a particular area is combined to see overall trends) looking at data for 28,872 patients hospitalised with Covid-19. The team found that overall there was no link between taking an ACE inhibitors or ARB and the likelihood of developing severe coronavirus complications."

Evidence:"The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and the long duration of the disease have led to a massive influx of patients admitted in health services and intensive care units. According to current knowledge, there are no treatments that prevent the spread of the infection, especially in exposed populations, or the disease progression to a severe form. Daily active smokers are infrequent among outpatients or hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Several arguments suggest that nicotine is responsible for this protective effect via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Nicotine may inhibit the penetration and spread of the virus and have a prophylactic effect in COVID-19 infection. However, the epidemic is progressing throughout French territory and new variants (in particular the "English B1."

Evidence:"And an early study from China also found that people with Type O blood were at a lower risk of being infected with COVID-19, while those with Type A were at a higher risk.“There have been multiple studies on blood types and COVID risk,” Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. “A few have not supported this association, but the majority have. It’s really fascinating.”Experts say there is potentially something to this. “Blood proteins may be correlated with immune function and inflammatory response,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Dr. Russo points out that the exact reason for this is still being studied, but there are some theories on why this may happen. One is that having Type O blood gives you antibodies against Types A and AB that may lower your risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through a particular receptor in your cells."

Acute methanol poisoning is a life-threatening type of metabolic and neurological intoxication that commonly occurs following the accidental ingestion of methylated spirits (Kraut and Kurtz 2008). Methyl alcohol toxicity in Iran related to the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has attracted the attention of the medical professionals. Just a few days after the widespread coronavirus outbreak, unfounded rumors circulated on social media that drinking or gargling alcohol could prevent or cure COVID-19. Subsequently, hospitals encountered a spike in the referral of poisoning cases for the ingestion of industrial-grade ethanol, resulting in an unprecedented high death toll due to alcohol poisoning. As of April 20, 2020, at the time of writing this letter, 700 people have died as a result of ingesting denatured alcohol in an attempt to fight the novel coronavirus."

Respiratory viruses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread when mucus or droplets containing the virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat. Most often, this happens through your hands. Hands are also one of the most common ways that the virus spreads from one person to the next. During a global pandemic, one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Here’s everything you need to know about how to wash your hands the right way:

Evidence:"Early studies in Wales and France are testing nicotine replacement therapy as a potential treatment for COVID-19, and more trials may soon be underway. It has also been suggested that studies currently testing nicotine replacement therapy for other conditions, such as a US study looking at nicotine replacement for reducing cognitive impairment, could look at COVID-19 outcomes as well. If the evidence begins to suggest that nicotine replacement therapy does improve COVID-19 outcomes, there would be a reason to rejoice. We need treatments urgently and nicotine replacement therapy is considered safe, is widely available, and is relatively cheap as it’s not protected by patent. But we are unlikely to know whether nicotine replacement has a role in COVID-19 any time soon. In the meantime, there is no value in people purchasing nicotine replacement to help protect themselves against COVID-19."

Evidence:"Cannabis compound CBD stops coronavirus in test tube, but can it treat COVID? | Reuters
Skip to main contentReuters homeWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsMoreMy ViewRegisterFuture of Health4 minute readJanuary 26, 20221:52 AM UTCLast Updated  agoCannabis compound CBD stops coronavirus in test tube, but can it treat COVID?By Nancy Lapid[1/2] A marijuana leaf is displayed at Canna Pi medical marijuana dispensary in Seattle, Washington, November 27, 2012. REUTERS/Anthony Bolante12Jan 25 (Reuters) - Early research suggesting that a popular non-psychoactive compound derived from marijuana might help prevent or treat COVID-19 warrants further investigation in rigorous clinical trials, researchers say.Several recent laboratory studies of cannabidiol, or CBD, have shown promising results, attracting media attention.However, many other potential COVID treatments that showed promise in test tubes, from hydroxychloroquine to various drugs used to treat cancer and other diseases, ultimately failed to show benefit for COVID-19 patients once studied in clinical trials.Marsha Rosner of the University of Chicago led a team that found CBD appeared to help curb SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells in laboratory experiments. "Our findings do not say this will work in patients. Our findings make a strong case for a clinical trial," she said.Using small doses of highly purified CBD that approximate what patients receive in an oral drug already approved for severe epilepsy, Rosner and colleagues found that CBD did not keep the coronavirus from infecting cells in test tubes.Rather, it acted soon after the virus entered the cells, blocking it from making copies of itself in part via effects on the inflammatory protein interferon. They found similar effects in infected mice, according to a report in Science Advances.When they looked at a group of adults with severe epilepsy, the researchers found those who were taking the approved CBD drug had lower rates of COVID-19."

Evidence:"Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in this setting. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine did not result in higher rates of serious adverse events including sudden death, ventricular arrhythmias, or retinopathy.Implications of all evidence availableThe COPE trial and the related meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was similar between treatment groups with no concerns regarding safety. The 95% confidence interval around the effect estimate shows that potential benefits or harms cannot be clearly excluded. Therefore, the definitive answer about the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients with COVID-19 remains uncertain and this treatment should not be routinely used in this clinical setting.IntroductionAs of March 2022, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 450 million people and caused approximately 6.0 million deaths worldwide since 2019.1World Health Organization (WHO)WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard.

Evidence:"We also take calls from health professionals for advice on how to manage poisonings. But over the past 18 months, we’ve seen an increasing number of people calling us about home remedies to prevent or cure COVID-19, particularly during an outbreak. They’re calling for advice before using items such as bleach or disinfectant. Or they’re calling to ask about side-effects after gargling, spraying or bathing in them. When asked about the reason for using such products, callers say they did not know they could be harmful. Some say they thought it was better to do something, rather than nothing."

Evidence:"Our retrospective study has analyzed 18 different vaccines and identified key vaccines that are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for confounding factors (see “Results” section). In particular, we find that individuals who have been recently vaccinated with one of Polio, HIB, MMR, Varicella, PCV13, Geriatric Flu, or HepA–HepB vaccines have lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These vaccines are promising candidates for follow-up pre-clinical animal studies and clinical trials in the COVID-19. For the rest of the 18 vaccines that we considered, the correlations with SARS-CoV-2 infection were either insignificant or varied across the time horizons of interest. In some cases, these vaccines may serve as negative controls in clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of novel COVID-19 vaccines. For example, a clinical trial evaluating the COVID-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 uses Meningococcal vaccine as a comparator arm16."

Evidence:"Inhaled budesonide, a common corticosteroid used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can reduce the recovery time for people not hospitalised with coronavirus by three days. The UK’s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said that while inhaled budesonide is “not currently being recommended as standard of care”, it can now be prescribed by GPs to those with Covid-19 on a case-by-case basis. The PRINCIPLE trial is the world’s largest Phase III platform randomised controlled trial to find a Covid-19 treatment that significantly shortens recovery time. All patients in the budesonide arm of the study were either over 50 with an underlying health condition that put them at greater risk from Covid-19, or aged over 65. Participants treated with budesonide were asked to inhale 800 micrograms twice a day for two weeks, and were followed up for 28 days. The study found that the median time to self-reported recovery for people taking inhaled budesonide was around three days shorter than for those following usual care."

Omega-3 fatty acid,             COVID-19,             Junk food
                            Higher levels of Omega-3 intake, including DHA and EPA, coupled with less junk food consumption, could be two key nutritional factors in explaining Japan’s fewer COVID-19 casualties compared to the US. According to an aggregation of findings in the review titled “Influence of Nutritional Intakes in Japan and the United States on COVID-19 Infection”​ published in the journal Nutrients​, the US diet contains very low levels of DHA and EPA compared to the Japanese diet.However, high intakes of EPA and DHA from sources like fish can improve health and possibly prevent cardiovascular diseases in the Japanese.“The key questions (to be asked) are why certain people are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the role of good nutrition in supporting immune function.​“Japan and the US are modern democratic countries with populations of over 100 million. Although both countries have loose COVID-19 regulations, the numbers of patients and deaths per million people due to COVID-19 differ markedly (119,026 and 1965, respectively, in the U.S. compared with 11,381 and 126, respectively, in Japan, as of 28 August 2021). ​“Even among the vaccinated, these differences are very large: cases and deaths per million were 167,302 and 2537, respectively, in the U.S. but only 13,776 and 146, respectively, in Japan, as of 2 January 2022. Therefore, the present study focused on the reasons for these differences,” ​said the researcher Yasuo Kagawa.Kagawa hypothesised that the dietary difference between Japan and the US is one of the major factors explaining the large difference in COVID-19 infections between the two countries.For this review, 1,209 papers from databases such as PubMed and CiNii were accessed, deriving 10 major factors for comparison, like nutritional prevention, obesity and immunity, and nutritional intake.Proving the hypothesis​Based on the data retrieved, there were significant differences in nutrient and food intakes between Japan and the US.For example, the intake of saturated fatty acids in Japan was around 20g for men and women, but the intake in the US was around 34g for men and 26g for women.The US diet also consists of a large amount of junk food, high dietary inflammatory index (DII) and low fibre, polyunsaturated fat and antioxidant content, which may increase vulnerability to COVID-19.Compared with food intakes in Japan (100%), the US beef consumption was 396%, sugar and sweeteners 235%, fish 44.3%, rice 11.5%, soybeans 0.5%, and tea 54.7%. The last four of these foods contain functional substances that may reduce the risk of infection, stated the paper.The sugar and sweetener intakes were 66.8 and 27.1 kg per capita annually in the US and Japan, respectively."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Transferring of pathogens, serum sickness, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) [67, 68], and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE requires prior exposure to similar antigens, suggesting that sera-containing antibodies against other coronaviruses may play a role in this phenomenon. But, it is still debatable that whether the IVIG can promote ADE or not [62, 69, 70].In conclusion, it is still difficult to determine whether or not IVIG should be included in the treatment strategy of COVID-19 patients. More randomized clinical trials with large sample sizes are required to decide the amount of IVIG efficacy.ConclusionThis study does not recommend IVIG therapy as a definitive cure for the acute phase of COVID-19 but instead summarizes the evidence and gives clues for upcoming trials. Several studies reported the advantage of IVIG therapy for COVID-19 patients. However, these studies are primarily case reports with small sample sizes and uncontrolled confounding factors."

Evidence:"In December, the FDA granted a fast track designation to remestemcel-L as a potential treatment for ARDS associated with COVID-19 infection. Based on findings from the updated analysis, Mesoblast announced plans to meet with the FDA to discuss next steps.The study enrolled 222 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, with 217 going on to be randomized 1:1 to receive standard of care alone or with 2 infusions of remestemcel-L. The cell therapy was administered at 2 x 10^6 cells/kg 3 to 5 days apart. Throughout the course of the study, the standard of care evolved, with the later incorporation of dexamethasone. In the first 50 patients enrolled, only 2% received dexamethasone compared with 84% in the subsequent 172 patients. Additionally, the age of patients enrolled increased throughout recruitment, starting with a mean age of 59 and advancing to an age of 67."

How to defend against the coronavirus with homemade hand sanitizer.With the coronavirus spreading, some stores have sold out of hand sanitizer.Buzz60Tito's Handmade Vodka is warning consumers to not use its spirits in do-it-yourself hand sanitizer recipes to protect against the coronavirus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says hand-washing with soap and water is the best way to clean your hands, but when that's not an option, the agency recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.The Texas-based vodka brand said Thursday in a statement on Twitter that its vodka is 40% alcohol, which is below the CDC's recommendation. Several brands of vodka are 80 proof as well.With stores across the nation sold out of hand sanitizer or with limited supplies, many are making batches with recipes circulating online versus paying marked-up prices from online sellers.Experts say it's important to pay attention to the percentage of alcohol in the vodka or isopropyl alcohol or ethanol alcohol being used in the homemade recipes.Can't find Purell or hand sanitizers? Here's how to make it at home with vodka or rubbing alcoholGouge much? Purell for $149, face masks for $20: Coronavirus price hikes are making everyone madPer the CDC, hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol. Tito's Handmade Vodka is 40% alcohol, and therefore does not meet the current recommendation of the CDC. Please see attached for more information."

Evidence:"Prevention of severe Covid-19 illness remained high throughout the time post vaccination and irrespective of virus mutation in contrast to overall SARS-CoV-2 infections and viral loads, both correlated with the risk of transmitting infections (Cohn et al., 2021). Additional options are urgently needed to effectively attenuate non-severe infections and naso-oropharyngeal virus concentrations in order to further contain viral dissemination (Goldberg et al., 2021). This applies in particular to variants with a proven higher peak virus load and transmissibility even in fully vaccinated individuals, i.e., the Delta or Omicron variants (Pouwels et al., 2021; Migueres et al., 2022).Broad antiviral effects, including virucidal activity against coronaviruses (CoV) were attributed to the medicinal plant Echinacea (Pleschka et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2009; Signer et al., 2020). In vitro, a hydroethanolic extract prepared from freshly-harvested herb and root parts of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce®, EF) inhibited infectivity of human CoV-229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoV, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 (Signer et al., 2020). Two earlier prevention studies in adults and children suggested clinically relevant benefits of EF for enveloped viral pathogens including coronaviruses (Nicolussi et al., 2022). The same extract exhibited adaptive immuno-modulating properties in vivo by reducing the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Ritchie et al., 2011)."

While most of these are fake and baseless, there are people who end up following these measures and further complicate their health. It is highly recommended that one should not follow any of these remedies as they are likely to impact your health.Recently, PIB cleared the myth that claimed that pouring two drops of lemon juice in the nose could completely kill COVID19 virus in the body.In the same league, another message doing rounds on social media titled 'Cure for Coronavirus' from Israel says that hot water, lemon slices, and soda bicarbonate together when consumed as 'hot tea' every afternoon could "immediately kills #COVID19 & completely eliminate it from the body". However, PIB fact-checked this and revealed that this claim is also fake.
