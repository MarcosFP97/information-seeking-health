Evidence:"The highest folate deficiency rates in the population occur among older adults, with estimated prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 20%.2 3 Evidence suggests that serum folate deficiency increases the likelihood of deficits in cognitive performance and neurological functioning.4 This situates serum folate as a possible biomarker positioned to modify the risk of dementia.5 However, the few observational studies that have examined the association between serum folate deficiency and the risk of dementia have shown inconsistent results.6–11 In total, four studies have shown low serum concentrations of folate/serum folate deficiency to be associated with an increased risk of dementia,6 7 9 11 and two studies have shown a null association.8 10 With one exception,10 all studies comprised of small sample sizes,6–9 11 and no study of the association between folate deficiency and the risk of dementia has considered that mortality precludes dementia, a bias that is appropriate to account for in studies of older adults.12
Folate deficiency is associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality in the general adult population.13 Despite the increased rate of folate deficiency in older adults,1 few observational studies have scrutinised the association between serum concentrations of folate and the risk of mortality, focusing on this population segment.14 In a large population-based cohort study, serum folate deficiency was associated with an increased risk of mortality in old age,15 whereas most small-scale survey-based longitudinal studies have yielded null results.14
Prior studies of the associations between serum concentrations of folate and the risks of incident dementia or all-cause mortality have been unable to directly exclude the possibility that such associations are a by-product of reverse causation. Reverse causation has been demonstrated to be particularly relevant to studies of dementia,16 because the neuropathological processes of dementia may start decades before a formal diagnosis is given.17 Thus, plausibly, serum folate deficiency is a consequence of preclinical dementia rather than its cause.ObjectiveThe current study aims to examine the association between serum folate deficiency and the risks of incident dementia and all-cause mortality in a large national sample of older adults, and to scrutinize reverse causation .MethodsPopulation and study designThe current study data are derived from electronic health records (EHRs) held at ‘Meuhedet Healthcare Services’ (hereafter Meuhedet), which provides healthcare services with national coverage to 14% of the total population of Israel as detailed elsewhere.18
A prospective birth cohort study design was applied (online supplemental figure 1). The eligible sample consisted of Israeli citizens from across the nation, aged 60–75 years in 2013, without pre-existing dementia (either a previous diagnosis or medication for dementia) for at least 10 years before serum folate measurements began. Individuals with pre-existing dementia were excluded from this study. All study participants were selected by their physician to be screened for serum concentrations of folate and had a least one serum folate blood test reported.Supplemental material

Evidence:"Studies show that diet and exercise can sharply lower the likelihood of diabetes, even in people at high risk of developing it.Other studies show that lifestyle interventions such as diet, exercise, and education can improve risk factors that are often associated with cardiovascular disease in individuals already living with type 2 diabetes, as well as help lower blood sugar levels. So not only does eating a nutritious diet and getting enough physical activity help manage blood sugar if you already have type 2 diabetes, but it can also aid in weight loss and high cholesterol — issues often closely tied to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Also, a major clinical study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases observed individuals at risk for diabetes for three years and found that including 150 minutes of exercise a week decreased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. This means sticking to physical activity and a nutritious diet may not only help you avoid or reverse a type 2 diabetes diagnosis now but in the future as well.Exercise: Begin with the basicsWhile diet can sometimes be tailored for you by a doctor or nutritionist (i.e., you can’t tolerate gluten, you prefer low carb, if you are a vegan, etc. ), the kind of exercise that works for evading or managing type 2 diabetes is a bit broader.Essentially: All exercise counts! Especially because doing something you enjoy helps you to stick with it. According to the American Heart Association, most adults need at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both.For instance, you could choose to go on two 30-minute powerwalks 2 days out of the week, combined with two 20-minute runs 2 other days of the week.Keep in mind: Moderate aerobic exercise elevates your heart rate, so if it’s possible for you, make sure those powerwalks are brisk!If moderate exercise isn’t possible, the American Diabetes Association says that even low-volume activity (expending just 400 kcal/week) improves insulin action in previously sedentary adults."

Drinking kefir -- a fermented probiotic milk known to help maintain the balance of good bacteria in the digestive system -- can have a positive effect on blood pressure by promoting communication between the gut and brain, a study conducted on rats has found. After nine weeks of kefir supplementation, the treated rats had lower levels of endotoxins -- toxic substances associated with a disruption in the cells -- lower blood pressure and improved intestinal permeability when compared with the untreated group. In addition, kefir supplementation restored the natural balance of four different bacteria in the gut and of an enzyme in the brain essential for normal nervous system function, suggesting that the nervous and digestive systems work together to reduce hypertension, the results showed.

It's not advisable to wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers, as it's often too late for the medicine to work.

Evidence:"DISCUSSION
The results of this study corroborate the effectiveness of pharmacologic doses of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing triglyceride concentrations in persons with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Relative to the placebo treatment, fasting triglycerides were reduced by 27% after the 3.4-g/d dose, consistent with previous reports (12, 42–46). The percentage reduction achieved was related to the subjects’ triglyceride concentrations after the placebo dose so that, on average, the subjects with the highest triglycerides achieved the greatest percentage reduction after the higher dose. The lower dose (0.85 g/d) did not alter lipid values, and fasting measures of glucose metabolism were not altered by either dose relative to placebo.As expected, the omega-3 fatty acid composition of erythrocytes increased in a dose-responsive manner, confirming compliance and uptake of omega-3 fatty acids into cellular membranes. After 8 wk of supplementation, the 3.4-g/d dose achieved an average omega-3 index associated with a reduced CVD risk (> 8%) (33). Because the duration of supplementation was only 8 wk, these values do not reflect maximum omega-3 uptake into RBC fatty acids (47)."

Probiotics linked with fewer respiratory symptoms in overweight and older people
				by 
					Benjie Coleman
					14 May 2021
An Imperial led study, which will be presented at Digestive Disease Week 2021, provides further evidence of a relationship between the gut and lungs. Daily probiotic use was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract symptoms in overweight and older people, according to a study that suggests a potential role for probiotics in preventing respiratory infections. “This is not necessarily the most intuitive idea, that putting bacteria into your gut might reduce your risk of respiratory infection,” said Benjamin Mullish, a lead researcher on the study and clinical lecturer in Imperial's Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, “but it's further evidence that the gut microbiome has a complex relationship with our various organ systems. It doesn’t just affect how our gut works or how our liver works, it affects aspects of how our whole body works.” 
Researchers re-analyzed detailed daily diaries of 220 patients who participated in an earlier double-blind placebo-controlled study on probiotics and weight loss. Reviewing the entries for common symptoms of upper respiratory infection, including cough, sore throat and wheezing, researchers found that participants who took probiotics during the six-month study had a 27 percent lower overall incidence of upper respiratory tract symptoms compared to the placebo group. The effect was largest among participants who were aged 45 years or older, as well as those with obesity."

The purpose of the research was to explore the effects of aromatherapy on pain, sleep quality, and psychological distress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The subjects of the study adopted the intentional sampling method, and the place of collection was patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the outpatient department of the rheumatology and immunology department of the hospital. The study was conducted with a randomized controlled trial design. It is estimated that 159 patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be admitted, and the participants will be randomly allocated into the experimental group, the comfort group and the control group with 53 participants. The experimental group received base oil and essential oil massage, the comfort group only received base oil massage for 10 minutes each time, three times a week for three weeks, and the control group did not receive any intervention measures. Repeated measurements were used to collect data using structured questionnaires."

Evidence:"Additional case histories supporting his claims are described in a 1954 publication by Defender Magazine (251). In his book, Hoxsey noted that cancer patients sought his treatment “as a last resort.” He wrote:
We don’t pretend to cure all of them. The vast majority are advanced and even terminal cases by the time we get them. Many come to us after the disease already has spread through the body; after surgery or irradiation has so impaired circulation of the blood to the affected areas that our treatment cannot reach them…Nevertheless we believe we cure a far greater percentage of cases treated than is cured by any other method at present known to science (418). In 947, the medical director of Hoxsey’s clinic stated it more specifically: he claimed they had been curing “85 percent of external cancers, and approximately 25 percent of internal cancers.”(664) In particular, it was noted that the outcome of treatment was “dependent to a great extent upon the lymphatic system, and our best results are in cancers that have a large lymphatic supply.” He stated that many of their patients had had “the limit of X ray and radium” and “in many of these, we cannot hope to cure the cancer itself because of the extensive prior destruction,” but that the Hoxsey treatment might “limit the further extension of the cancer and keep the patient free from pain thereafter.” This director noted, “in almost every case that the general health of the patient improves” as a result of the treatment. He concluded that “we know that the Hoxsey treatment cures cancer, and it is only reasonable to believe that we have within our grasp the cause, and eventually the complete solution, of the cancer problem” (664)."

Evidence:"The scientists found that 200 to 400 mg L-theanine per day (as 1 or 2 doses) consistently reduces stress and anxiety responses in people exposed to stressful conditions. Importantly, in the 8-week long studies, side effects in the L-theanine groups did not differ from the placebo groups, showing that L-theanine seems to be perfectly safe and well tolerated, even when taken for months. So, if you know you have a stressful event coming up and want to try L-theanine, I’d take the amount shown to be effective by this analysis. Take the first dose about 1 h before the event, although I’ll add that the timing of L-theanine intake hasn’t been well studied. Effects of L-theanine on sleep

Exercise can improve depressive symptoms in people with depression. However, similar to other treatments, exercise is not a panacea and may not work equally for all. A seminal study by Dunn et al. (30), the Depression Outcomes Study of Exercise, found a response rate of about 40% in depressed people free from other treatments. These results are comparable with more recent data found in the REGASSA trial, the largest study with exercise and depression, which found a response rate of about 50% (31). The remission rate (people who no longer meet criteria for MDD diagnosis) was evaluated in the Treatment with Exercise Augmentation for Depression (TREAD) study (32) using and adapting (16 kilocalories per kilogram of weight spent in exercise per week) the pioneering idea of Andrea Dunn in determining the exercise dose based on the energetic expenditure did find a remission rate of about 28%."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Some people recommend applying liquid soap to a cotton ball until it's soaked through and covering the tick for 30 seconds. However, smothering the tick is generally advised against, since it can make the bite worse. Experts agree the safest, most efficient tick removal method involves gentle, firm tweezing. Sadly the rumours are not true and smearing Vaseline (or any petroleum jelly) on the tick won't make the removal easier, and could in fact make the bite worse. By antagonising the tick, it might release more saliva – or worse, regurgitate its stomach contents – into your bite wound."

New Study Reveals Zinc Really Might Help Treat a Cold, But There's a Catch
Health01 November 2021By Carly Cassella

In 1771, the German physician Hieronymus David Gaubius introduced the western scientific community to "a medication with many promises" – zinc.More than 200 years later, we can find it amongst the many supplements on pharmacy shelves. It's even known to be one of the rare things that might help fight off a common cold. Or does it? Evidence for zinc supplement use is limited, study results have been mixed, and dosage, formulation and length of prescription have not been investigated properly to date.A new meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials has now strengthened the notion that supplementing zinc could prevent symptoms and shorten the duration of viral respiratory infections, like the common cold or the flu. "It is commonly thought that zinc's role in preventing and treating infections is only for people who are zinc deficient; our findings really challenge this notion," says integrative medicine doctor Jennifer Hunter from Western Sydney University in Australia. "The two large trials from China found very low dose zinc nasal spray reduced the risk of clinical illness."
Question:Can zinc help treat the common cold? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"However, it will not cure athlete’s foot on the bottom or sides of the feet, which is known as moccasin type. Lamisil AT Cream can also cure athlete’s foot in those aged 12 years and above. The spray pump and solution forms only cure the condition between the toes if used twice daily for 1 week, but the cream can also cure the infection on the bottom and sides of the feet when used twice daily for 2 weeks. A newer product, Lamisil AT Gel, can cure athlete’s foot between the toes of patients aged 12 years and above when used just once daily for 1 week. This presents enhanced convenience in use, as no other product cures this quickly when used only once daily. With such an array of OTC options available to treat and even cure athlete’s foot, it is always a good idea to ask your pharmacist for a recommendation for the most appropriate product."
Question:Can fungal creams treat athlete's foot? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"If your child does experience diarrhea or other stomach problems while taking an antibiotic, the most important thing to do is ensure your child is drinking enough water and staying hydrated. If GI symptoms do not resolve within 7-10 days, call your pediatrician. Another well-known approach to prevent or relieve diarrhea from antibiotics is taking a probiotic. Research suggests there may be some preventive benefits to taking probiotics when starting an antibiotic. However, Dr. Gurram cautions not to take all the research at face value."

Evidence:"The evidence also suggests that low intensity, active music therapy for ≤60 minutes per week by a non-music therapist, or other music interventions by any specialty therapist had no impact on depression. For settings with limited resources or those that have no access to the services of a trained music therapist, music medicine by listening to music of older adult's own preference for >60 minutes per week should be considered as an alternative approach. If a music intervention is deemed appropriate for older adults, we encourage clinician and caregivers to consider our findings when deciding music interventions protocol to achieve the best outcome on depression.ContributorsTD updated the search, undertook study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analysis. TS and NP performed the original search and divided the task to undertook study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. TD wrote the first draft of the manuscript with TT, NC and BD. All authors revised and approved the final version of the manuscript."

Evidence:"Vitamin D supplementation did not, however, affect the risk for adverse events, nor did it improve lung function or everyday asthma symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath. “Meta-analysis of a modest number of trials in people with predominantly mild to moderate asthma suggests that vitamin D is likely to reduce both the risk of severe asthma exacerbation and healthcare use,” the researchers concluded. “It is as yet unclear whether these effects are confined to people with lower baseline vitamin D status; further research, including individual patient data meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed to clarify this issue. Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.”

Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease in infants 
Review questionDoes feeding infants with a formula containing hydrolysed protein result in decreased risk of developing allergic disease such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever and food allergy during infancy and childhood?BackgroundAllergic disease is responsible for a substantial health burden among infants, children and adults. Early dietary intake may influence the development of allergic disease. When babies are not exclusively breast fed, use of hydrolysed formula instead of ordinary cow's milk formula may reduce allergic disease among babies and children, although additional studies are needed to confirm this. Infant formulas have been designed to lower the chance of infants developing allergic disease. These include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy milk formulas. Hydrolysed formulas break down milk proteins into smaller, potentially less allergy-producing proteins.ResultsThis review of trials found no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease in preference to exclusive breast feeding."
