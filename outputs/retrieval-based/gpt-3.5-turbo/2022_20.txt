Evidence:"(Adele reportedly lost her crystals right before her Grammys performance this year, and believes it may have triggered all those technical issues, The Sun reports. )Now for the reality: There’s zero scientific evidence that crystals can do anything to heal the brain or the body, and just about any M.D. But here’s the thing—if you believe crystals will make you feel better, that all-powerful placebo effect and the power of suggestion could help you feel just that.“I used to find this kind of stuff irritating and weird, but I’ve become more open-minded,” says Eden Fromberg, D.O., an osteopathic physician based in New York City. “If my patients are connecting to something and it improves their symptoms, I can’t roll my eyes at that.” However, you should always seek help from a medical professional for physical or mental ailments—because crystals definitely won't cure you.

I remember hearing about using WD-40 on stiff knee joints a few months ago and many people say it helps lubricate thier knee joints. People swear by it, saying before they used WD-40 thier knees felt stiff and hurt, but after spraying WD-40 pain and stiffness went away.I think the whole things crazy and GP's advise is not to use it as it contains petroleum-related products that could irritate the skin. There a news article about how WD-40 helps arthritus and a 70-year-old retired sales manager from Stamford, Lincs, says: Its been an absolute godsend for me, WD-40 has given me a hell of a lot of relief, A few weeks ago, I was even running around the garden with my grandson.

Fructose from whole fruit doesn’t add to your intake of free (or added) sugar, but in fruit juice or a smoothie it does.What is free (added) sugar?Free (added) sugar includes the sugars added to foods by manufacturers, eg in cakes, chocolates, jam, some pasta sauces, fizzy drinks and breakfast cereals. It also includes the sugar found in fruit juices, smoothies and honey.A recent report by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), stated that we need to reduce our intake of free (added) sugars by half.The report recommends that we should consume no more than 5 per cent of our energy from free sugar. This means the maximum daily intake of free (added) sugar should be:19g, equal to 5 cubes or 5 tsp of sugar, for children (aged 4 to 7)24g, equal to 6 cubes or 6 tsp of sugar, for children aged (7 to 10)30g, equal to 7 cubes or 7 tsp of sugar, for children (over 11) and adultsEating too much free (added) sugar contributes towards obesity, tooth decay and also puts people at risk of Type 2 diabetes. The report clearly states that we do not need to cut down our intake of whole fruit and, in fact, recommends that we eat more.The best thing you can do is to get label savvy, so that you are aware of all the hidden free (added) sugars in the foods that you buy."

Hence, such children, on being forced to swap the pencil or pen from their left hand to their right hand to write, often do not know the right way to write and thus have very illegible handwriting. This affects their examination performances in school and college and even causes their colleagues to question their abilities at work.

Colorado  A group of people in Colorado are convinced that drinking their own urine and using it to treat skin conditions is beneficial to their health and well-being.The Urine Therapy of Colorado meetup Group meets once a month in the Downtown Boulder Public Library for about an hour and a half to listen to a presentation and then hold a question-and-answer session to discuss urine-drinking benefits.Group member Christopher Macor told NBC 9 that he has used his own urine for eczema on his hands when creams and ointments were not available. He said the practice known as Shivambhu goes back 4,000 years. "It's the fluid of your body that's being given to you," Macor said.The Shivambhu website calls it "The Golden Age of Well-Being. "Indira Bhatt Gupta, another group member, said she has used her own urine since 1983 as a topical treatment and a way to cure other ailments."

Evidence:"There has been lots of research into Omega 3 fats and oily fish and how they can improve heart health. In countries where people eat more oily fish, such as in the Mediterranean, Greenland and Japan, fewer people have heart disease compared to countries where people eat very little oily fish, such as the UK. The Omega 3 fats EPA and DHA can help protect the heart and blood vessels from disease: They can help:
lower triglycerides (a fat that enters your blood after a meal)
improve circulation (blood flow around the body)
prevent blood clots
lower blood pressure
keep the rhythm of your heart steady. Higher levels of the Omega 3 fats EPA and DHA in the blood have also been linked with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. There is still research on-going, but doctors think that the benefits come from eating foods that contain omega 3s rather than over-the-counter supplements. However, some high-dose Omega 3 supplements may be prescribed by your doctor to treat hypertriglyceridaemia."

Although there are theoretical concerns for the fetus, including teratogenesis, tissue heating, and acoustic damage, there exists no evidence of actual harm. With regard to teratogenesis, there are no published human studies documenting harm, and the preponderance of animal studies do not demonstrate risk 1. Tissue heating is proportional to the tissue’s proximity to the scanner and, therefore, is negligible near the uterus 1 7.

Evidence:"(Research cited by The Skin Cancer Foundation indicates almost 25 percent of our lifetime exposure to UV radiation is sustained during childhood.) Additionally, children are more vulnerable to retinal damage from UV rays because the lens inside a child’s eye is clearer than an adult lens, enabling more UV to penetrate further into the eye. Prevent cataracts and protect your eyes from the sun’s rays with quality sunglasses
According to a national Sun Safety Survey conducted by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, only about half of people who wear sunglasses say they check the UV rating before buying. The good news is you can easily protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful UV and HEV rays, by looking for sunglasses that block 100 percent of UV rays and that also absorb most HEV rays. It is also important to protect as much of the delicate skin around your eyes as possible, look for sunglasses with large lenses or a close-fitting wraparound style. Depending on your outdoor lifestyle, you may also want to consider performance or sport sunglasses."

Chimpanzees may have evolved resistance to HIV precursor
          11 December 2019        
                  Simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey- and ape-infecting virus that HIV originated from, may have influenced the genetics of chimpanzees, finds a new UCL-led study. The virus is a leading contributor to differences between chimpanzee subspecies, according to the findings published in PLOS Genetics.While chimpanzees are not badly affected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the researchers say the findings suggest that some subspecies may have evolved a degree of tolerance to the virus.“Unlike humans, who when infected by HIV suffer devastating health consequences, chimpanzees can remain healthy when infected with the SIV virus,” said the study’s senior author, Dr Aida Andrés (UCL Genetics Institute and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology).“This suggests that chimpanzees may have evolved biological mechanisms to limit the virus’ pathogenicity - that is, the virus’ ability to cause disease.”By analysing the genomes of four subspecies of chimpanzees living in Africa, the research team found that the genetic variants that evolved uniquely in eastern chimpanzees were disproportionately related to immune responses, particularly to the response to infection by SIV.The strongest selective pressure (any factor contributing to how subspecies have evolved differently) that the authors could identify was on immune system function, believed to be due to adaptation to SIV, as the virus appears to have significantly contributed to genetic differences between subspecies.“Only two subspecies of chimpanzees seem infected by the virus in the wild (central and eastern chimpanzees) and it is precisely those two subspecies that accumulate genetic changes in genes related to SIV infection,” said Dr Joshua Schmidt, the first author of the paper (UCL Genetics Institute, now at the University of Adelaide).Co-author Dr Sergi Castellano (UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology), said: “As the genes we identified may have contributed to a reduction of the pathogenicity of SIV in chimpanzees, it would be interesting to study them in humans infected by HIV.”Chimpanzees, humans’ closest relatives, are in danger of extinction, and transmissible disease is among the top threats, so the findings may also be relevant to conservation efforts.The study involved researchers at the UCL Genetics Institute, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (Barcelona), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, and Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (Barcelona), and was supported by Max Planck Society, Wellcome, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research and the NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre."

      Water, drinks and your health
It's easy to overlook, but choosing healthier drinks is a key part of getting a balanced diet.Many soft drinks, including instant powdered drinks and hot chocolate, are high in sugar.Food and drinks that are high in sugar are often high in calories, and having too many calories can make you more likely to gain weight.Some energy drinks are high in both sugar and caffeine.

Evidence:"However, the HIV virus is  present in the following body fluids in infectious quantities:
Blood and blood products
Semen and pre cum 
Vaginal and cervical secretions 
Breast milk. An  HIV-positive person may have HIV in very small amounts in other body fluids  such as tears, saliva and blister fluid, but usually not in enough amount to be  infectious. Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result  in transmission of HIV. Transmission: How is the HIV virus transmitted? It is via the exchange of  bodily fluids containing HIV virus that person-to-person transmission can  occur. The  main routes of HIV transmission are through:
Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person
Sharing needles with an infected person
From an infected mother to child during pregnancy, during birth or after birth while breastfeeding."
Question:Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"Here are 7 health benefits of Himalayan Salt Lamp:
Cures Coughing
Most of the dust particles in our home have positive ions which reduce the effectiveness of our breathing tract and induce coughing. Himalayan Salt Lamps attract the positive ions and improve the air quality. Thus, we get a clean throat and fresh breath. Builds Up Concentration
Negative ions released by the Himalayan Salt Lamps increase the blood flow and oxygen supply to our body, which leads to an increase in our concentration power. So, they are ideal to be placed on the study table of your kids! Purifies Air
Salt lamps have the quality to trap the contaminants like dust particles, cigarette smoke, pollens and several other allergens."

Evidence:"Here are the answers to some frequently asked questions about breastfeeding while pregnant. Some people believe that continuing to breastfeed when you’re pregnant can increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm labour. This is a myth, says Halifax midwife CJ Blennerhassett, stemming from the fact that breastfeeding releases oxytocin, the same hormone that helps create contractions during labour. But there’s no legitimate evidence this can be harmful. “Studies have shown the uterus isn’t as responsive or sensitive to oxytocin until the final weeks of a normal pregnancy,” says Anita Arora, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant based in Oakville, Ont."

Evidence:"Supplements with moderate evidence
The evidence regarding the benefits of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc is often mixed, but it suggests a positive effect. Vitamin C
Vitamin C is marketed as the go-to supplement for preventing and treating colds. Mechanistically, it makes sense: vitamin C helps immune cells form and function, and it supports the physical barriers (such as the epithelial cells of your skin) that protect you from pathogens. [3] Moreover, at least 148 animal studies have found that vitamin C administration helps prevent infections caused by microorganisms. [4]
Those animal studies, however, don’t answer the question that most matters to us: can vitamin C supplementation help humans ward off colds? A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of human studies tried to answer this question,[5] and here are the takeaways:
People who start taking vitamin C when they already have a cold don’t appear to see much of a benefit."

Evidence:"The idea behind the trend is quite simple: squeeze some lemon into your coffee to help burn fat and, consequently, kickstart your weight-loss journey.Plenty of TikTok users posted videos of themselves trying the trend and some of them have been quite candid in saying that they don't exactly dig the flavor combo. @kennybosslady Time for Inner and Outer Healing...Mind and body alignment...#SelfLove #LetsDoThis #CoffeeandLemonChallenge #day1 #ProudofMe ♬ original sound - kennybosslady   Some folks said "hell no" after giving it the old college try, including one TikTok user that said she actually gained weight after drinking lemon in her coffee for a week straight (heads up: there are some expletives in that one!). Still, many swear that a touch of lemon in their coffee has helped them shed some pounds, including this TikTok user claiming an 8-pound weight loss in two weeks (though she also outlines other diet changes she made).So does it really work? TODAY spoke with a few registered dietitians to find out.Where did the idea for this viral challenge come from anyway?We can't be sure of its origin, but it's likely that whoever kicked off this viral challenge was thinking about the much-touted value of adding a lemon slice to your water.

Evidence:"Most other citrus fruits, such as lemons, limes, citrons, naturally sweet oranges and tangerines are not thought to have this effect. However, tangellos, a hybrid of grapefruit, may also interfere with drugs. How Grapefruit and Its Juice React with Certain Medications
There are substances in grapefruit that can interfere with the way your body absorbs and breaks down (metabolizes) certain drugs. This interference allows a higher amount of the drug than usual to circulate in your bloodstream, which can occasionally result in serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. As little as one glass of grapefruit juice (8 oz. or 250 mL) can cause an increased blood drug level and the effects can last for three days or more."

Evidence:"People using wi-fi, or those in the proximity of wi-fi equipment, are exposed to the radio signals it emits and some of the transmitted energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies. This guidance sets out the UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) position regarding such exposure. General position
There is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio signals from wi-fi and WLANs adversely affects the health of the general population. The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point), and the results so far show exposures are well within the internationally-accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency (RF) exposures from wi-fi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones. Also, the frequencies used in wi-fi are broadly the same as those from other RF applications such as FM radio, TV and mobile phones."

Evidence:"Some people have read online that taking apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, and they may commit to taking a shot of the sour stuff every day, sometimes at bedtime. But experts recommend against this practice for several reasons. “Apple cider vinegar hasn’t been shown to aid with weight loss in humans, despite the things you may have read on social media, and it may be harmful if people ingest it the wrong way or at the wrong time of day,” says Elliot Rudnitzky, M.D., cardiologist at JFK University Medical Center. Here’s what you should know about apple cider vinegar:
Apple cider hasn’t been proven to help with weight loss
Some research has shown that obese rats who consumed apple cider vinegar consumed less food and lost weight, but similar results have not been proven in humans. Little research has been done to study the effects of apple cider vinegar on appetite and weight loss in humans, and the handful of studies have been inconclusive. In studies where people did curb their appetite or lose weight with the help of apple cider vinegar, the weight loss was modest, not dramatic."
