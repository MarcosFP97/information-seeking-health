Evidence:"“We all want to effect change, and crystals are tools that can help us.”Do crystals have healing powers?While no legitimate studies have been conducted to back up the claims that crystals emit vibrations that affect our minds and bodies, some stones can conduct energy. In 1880, French physicist Pierre Curie (Marie Curie’s husband) discovered that putting pressure on various crystals – including quartz, topaz and tourmaline – created electricity. This phenomenon, called the Piezoelectric effect, is why crystals are used as essential elements in computers, TV screens, iPhones and satellites. Limited studies have indicated that crystals can increase the alkalinity of water – so the makers of Glacce water bottles, which expose H2O to stones such as obsidian and rose quartz, might be on to something. There is also science to support the benefits of using crystals in skincare beyond the finely milled quartz often found in exfoliators. Magnetized tourmaline, for example – a key ingredient in La Mer The Cleansing Foam – energizes skin to improve cleansing efficacy and boost circulation."

Evidence:"Collagen increases the integrity of cartilage - the elastic structure that protects joints, and its decreasing amount in cartilage with age has been linked to osteoarthritis. Taken for joints, collagen can alleviate symptoms of already existing degeneration, reduce the formation of new lesions, and reduce joint pain. Supplementation with collagen for joints is necessary for a minimum period of 3-6 months. Not only calcium and vitamin D3 are responsible for healthy and strong bones. Do not forget about collagen - an important component of the bone. Its supplementation for a minimum of 3 months is linked to a lower risk of osteomalacia, osteoporosis and bone fractures."

Evidence:"New studies show a correlation in lab rats, but the evidence may not resolve ongoing debates over causality or whether any effects arise in people. The ionizing radiation given off by sources such as x-ray machines and the sun boosts cancer risk by shredding molecules in the body. But the non-ionizing radio-frequency (RF) radiation that cell phones and other wireless devices emit has just one known biological effect: an ability to heat tissue by exciting its molecules. Still, evidence advanced by the studies shows prolonged exposure to even very low levels of RF radiation, perhaps by mechanisms other than heating that remain unknown, makes rats uniquely prone to a rare tumor called a schwannoma, which affects a type of neuron (or nerve cell) called a Schwann cell."

Mosquito-borne illnesses
Back to Bugs and Outbreaks page
Mosquitoes can quickly ruin a nice day or evening outdoors with their itchy bites. However, mosquito bites can also cause illnesses, some of which can be quite serious. These are mosquito-borne illnesses you’ve likely heard of, and that cause the biggest health issues: Zika virus, malaria, chikungunya, and West Nile Virus (WNV). Zika virus is spread through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. Only about 1 in 5 people infected with Zika will develop symptoms. If a person does develop symptoms, they’re usually mild and include fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis."

No link between autism and childhood vaccinationsWe don’t know exactly what causes autism, but there are many theories. Some theories have good evidence, but other theories are unproven, with little or no scientific evidence behind them.One of these unproven theories is that autism is caused by childhood vaccinations, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunisation. Another theory is that the mercury-based preservative (thiomersal) that was once used in vaccinations is to blame.Although these issues were of particular concern in the 1990s and early 2000s, many studies have been conducted since then. We now know that there is no scientific evidence that either the MMR vaccine or mercury is involved in the development of autism.In other words, vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism.There’s no one proven answer to the question of what causes autism. But causes might include brain development and genetic factors.MMR and autism: discredited theoriesIn 1998, researcher Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a paper in the medical journal The Lancet describing an apparently new syndrome linking developmental disorders (like autism) and bowel problems in children who had previously been developing typically.In 8 of only 12 cases studied, parents linked the beginning of the behaviour difficulties with the MMR vaccination.The researchers stated that they did not prove a link between the MMR vaccine and the new syndrome. But their paper discussed the proposed link extensively."

Evidence:"Oramorph SR (discontinued). While morphine is effective in treating pain, it also has a high potential for misuse, also often called “abuse.” Morphine misuse includes using at higher doses or taking it in ways other than prescribed, such as using morphine to get high.3,6
Is Morphine Addictive? Morphine is an effective pain relief medication, but it can also result in pleasurable feelings. It is often misused for this purpose.4 Regular use of morphine, even when used therapeutically as prescribed by a doctor, can result in tolerance and physiological dependence. Both are adaptations of the body to a drug and are often precursors to developing an opioid use disorder, a chronic medical illness marked by the compulsive use of opioids despite harmful and negative consequences.3,7 
If you’ve been using morphine as directed and have experienced uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms as a result of missing a dose or two, your body has likely developed a physiological dependence on the drug."

Similarly, drinking one or more cups of orange juice per day increased the risk of diabetes by about 24% compared with drinking less than one cup a month. They also found that drinking carbonated beverages, colas (sugar sweetened and low-calorie) and fruit punch increased the risk of diabetes between 4 and 11% per increase in daily single servings. What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results? The researchers conclude that the study has shown a positive association between fruit juice consumption and diabetes risk.

A study from the 70s examined more than 7 000 school children and found no difference in intellectual ability between left handers and right handers. “The world is not a left handed-friendly place – utensils, scissors and other items of daily use are designed for the right-handed person,” says Dr. Ochoa. “Left handed people have to think flexibly and come up with ways to use those tools and navigate.”Left handed people have shorter tempersThere’s a general perception that left handed and ambidextrous people are more prone to negative emotions."

EpidemiologyMethanol poisoning or intoxication is rare and often occurs after suicidal or accidental oral ingestion of methanol-containing agents, or after consumption of adulterated or "moonshine" alcoholic beverages 1,2.Clinical presentationPatients can present with a variety of devastatingly disabling clinical features, often after a 12-24 hour latency:
visual disturbances characterized by optic neuritis and eventual blindness 1,3 
CNS features such as a headache, dizziness, fatigue, and eventual permanent neurological dysfunction 1-3
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 1,4
severe uncompensated metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap 1,2,4
eventual coma and death are common 1,2

Who can have one
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very safe and most people are able to have the procedure.But in some instances an MRI scan may not be recommended.When your doctor refers you for an MRI scan, tell them if:you think you have any metal in or on your bodyyou're pregnant or breastfeedingyou've ever had an allergic reaction to a contrast agentyou have kidney problemsThe strong magnets used during the scan can affect any metal implants or fragments in your body.There's no evidence that MRI scans are a risk for pregnant women, but whether you'll be offered one depends on why you need it.A doctor can discuss with you whether an MRI scan or contrast agent (dye) is suitable for you. If you do have an MRI scan, the radiographers will make sure it's as safe as possible for you and your baby. Metal implants or fragments
Having something metallic in your body doesn't necessarily mean you can't have an MRI scan, but it's important for medical staff carrying out the scan to be aware of it.They can decide on a case-by-case basis if there are any risks, or if further measures need to be taken to ensure the scan is as safe as possible.For example, it may be possible to make a pacemaker or defibrillator MRI-safe, or to monitor your heart rhythm during the procedure.You may need to have an X-ray if you're unsure about any metal fragments in your body.Examples of metal implants or fragments include:a pacemaker – a small electrical device used to control an irregular heartbeatan implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – a similar device to a pacemaker that uses electrical shocks to regulate heartbeatsmetal plates, wires, screws or rods – used during surgery for bone fracturesa nerve stimulator – an electrical implant used to treat long-term nerve paina cochlear implant – a device similar to a hearing aid that's surgically implanted inside the eara drug pump implant – used to treat long-term pain by delivering painkilling medication directly to an area of the body, such as the lower backbrain aneurysm clips – small metal clips used to seal blood vessels in the brain that would otherwise be at risk of rupturing (bursting)stents, filters and vascular coils – small metal devices that are surgically implanted in blood vesselsmetallic fragments in or near your eyes or blood vessels (common in people who do welding or metalwork for a living)prosthetic (artificial) metal heart valvespenile implants – used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence)eye implants – such as small metal clips used to hold the retina in placean intrauterine device (IUD) or coil – a contraceptive device made of plastic and copper that fits inside the wombartificial joints – such as those used for a hip replacement or knee replacementdental fillings and bridgestubal ligation clips – used in female sterilisationsurgical clips or staples – used to close wounds after an operationtattoos or permanent make-upobjects such as bullets or shrapnelbreast expanders – used after a mastectomyinsulin pumps and glucose monitors – electronic devices used by some people with diabetes
Tattoos
Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal, but most tattoos are safe in an MRI scanner.Tell the radiographer immediately if you feel any discomfort or heat in your tattoo during the scan. Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022

      If you've been diagnosed with borderline or high cholesterol, you probably already know the importance of losing weight and eating a healthy diet. But there's another part of the lifestyle prescription that's just as important: exercise. "When it comes to cholesterol, there are three things your doctor is looking at: your LDL ("bad" cholesterol), HDL ("good" cholesterol) and your triglycerides (a type of fat found in your blood)," explains Suzanne Steinbaum, DO, a cardiologist in New York City and spokesperson for the American Heart Association (AHA).

Evidence:"showing people who wore hats and sunglasses to protect their eyes from strong sun shine could substantially reduce the risk of cataracts [3]. We confirmed ocular protection against sunlight might decrease risk of cataract formation and our results corresponded with prior suggestion that additional protection means such as broad-brimmed hat might have additive protective effect of UVR when combined with glasses [23]. The current study also could be comparable with the French study, which reported professional exposure to sunlight might increase 63% of posterior subcapsular cataract, but frequent use of sunglasses might offer a 40% decrease in the risk of posterior subcapsular cataract [24]. Based on such evidence, encouraging the public to use hats, sunglasses and umbrellas during period of high UVR is therefore beneficial, effective, and imperative.Interestingly, knowledge and attitudes toward sunlight protection did not necessarily translate into behavior of practices of ocular protection under harsh daylight as noticed in the current study. Although sunglasses can be used to protect eyes from UVR to reduce risk of cataract, the actual percentage of individuals to wear sunglasses for sunlight protection might be suboptimal. In Hawaii, direct observation in public outdoor recreation settings revealed that only one third of the population wore sunglasses [10]."

HIV-1 strain. These three separate findings each yielded different SIVcpz
strains but shared key features: All came from Pan troglodytes troglodytes
chimps that originated in central west Africa; all are genetically 70 percent
to 90 percent identical to human AIDS viruses; and in no case did the viruses
appear to sicken the chimps or cause any illness. So it's probable, experts now say, that HIV-1 did come
from chimpanzees and perhaps has been introduced frequently from chimp to
human over the last four or five decades."

Evidence:"]HIV is a relatively fragile virus, which is not spread by casual contact. HIV is not easy to “catch”—it must be acquired. In order for HIV to be transmitted, three conditions must occur:There must be an HIV source.There must be a sufficient dose of virus.There must be access to the bloodstream of another person.Body Fluids That Can Transmit HIVAnyone infected with the virus is potentially a source of HIV infection. Transmission occurs primarily through infected blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or breast milk. Sweat, tears, saliva, urine, and feces are not capable of transmitting HIV unless visibly contaminated with blood.In settings such as hospital operating rooms, other fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid may be considered infectious if the source is HIV positive. These fluids are generally not found outside the hospital setting."

There’s some evidence that breastfeeding reduces the likelihood of pregnancy. Known as the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), this temporary form of birth control relies on a lack of a period (and thus, absence of ovulation) as its driving force. LAM only really works if your period is delayed, and that delay depends on the production of the hormone oxytocin."

Evidence:"Meanwhile, some statins may be able to cross into the brain and disrupt its cholesterol metabolism. Further complicating the discussion, this drug class is known to have occasional cognitive side effects: memory loss; confusion. However, research shows these effects don’t last: There is currently no established evidence that statins have any bearing on long-term cognitive function or dementia risk. Some vocal opponents of statins have made the unfounded leap that because some statins cross into the brain, and because they may lead to cognitive issues in a small portion of the population, they can lead to dementia. “These symptoms are immediate and reverse with stopping the medication,” Ferris told Being Patient. The bottom line: There’s no evidence that statins cause Alzheimer’s or dementia."

Evidence:"This means that over time, not getting enough vitamin C may increase your risk of disease. (1)
Does vitamin C help prevent colds? According to a study published in the journal Nutrition , vitamin C helps maintain the integrity of the epithelial barriers in our bodies (which are all surfaces that prevent any external pollutants from entering our bodies) such as the skin and intestinal walls. Vitamin C also helps protect our skin from pathogens by strengthening its structure and enhancing its ability to "scrape" free radicals, and boosts our immune system's ability to detect and destroy microbes before they begin to pose a threat to our health. So in theory, vitamin C should protect us from these minor respiratory infections. But according to a Cochrane systematic review, there is no evidence that vitamin C supplementation reduces the incidence of the common cold in the general population."

Evidence:"Red meat
Experts from the International Association for Research on Cancer Reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was “limited” evidence to suggest that excess red meat consumption caused bowel cancer. For this reason they concluded it was a “probable carcinogen”, but couldn’t conclude exactly how much it increased your cancer risk by – or say how much needed to be consumed to increase the risk. However, there did appear to be an association with increased cancer risk when more than 100g a day was consumed. Processed meats
Evidence suggests that there is a link between excess consumption of processed meats, and cancer risk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has found that consuming excess processed meats is a cause of bowel cancer. Experts concluded that over the long term, consuming a 50g portion of processed meat consumed daily (that’s two slices of bacon) increased the risk of bowel cancer by 18%."

Evidence:"Skin tags are not contagious. Treatment of Skin Tags at Derma
Your appointment will begin with a skin check and medical history, followed by recommended treatment options. Treatment for a skin tag depends on several factors, including its location on your body, its size, and the degree to which it interferes with your day to day activities, but together with the dermatologist, you will discuss the latest and most effective treatments. The dermatologist will explain all potential side-effects, enabling you to select the best option for you, and depending on insurance, treatment can often be carried out the same day as the consultation. It’s important to note that while the dermatologist can usually remove most skin tags effectively, it depends on whether removal is medically suitable – for example, if it is likely to resolve on its own without causing any serious problems, it might be better to monitor the skin tag and let it heal without intervening, since removal might not be appropriate in a certain area, like the eyelid, or could risk leaving a scar that would be more noticeable. Most people can safely have their skin tags removed, but like any medical treatment, it is important to undergo a thorough consultation beforehand."

Evidence:"But do you really need to stay away from bananas if you have diabetes? Not necessarily, and here are a few reasons why:
Glycemic index
The glycemic index (GI) is a gauge of the rise in blood sugar after eating a food that contains carbohydrate. The higher the GI, the more likely the food will cause a high blood sugar. Ripe bananas have a GI of 51, which is considered low (a GI of 55 or lower means that the food will not significantly raise blood sugars). And a slightly unripe banana has a GI of 42, which is even lower. (You might want to limit eating overripe bananas, however, as they have a higher GI of around 62)."

Evidence:"When it comes to cell phones, scientists have looked at findings from animal research and cells in test tubes exposed to RF radiation in a lab, as well as observational studies in humans. These human studies have tried to see whether heavy users of cell phones have higher rates of brain cancers and other health problems compared with people who use cell phones less often. All that research—in test tubes, animals, and humans—has been mixed, with no definitive proof that cell-phone radiation harms human health, but also unable to completely clear it of any potential risk. The research into the RF signals used with WiFi is even more preliminary, focused on lab and animal studies, making it even more difficult to reach firm conclusions about their safety or risk. But researchers can make some judgments about the potential for harm based on how WiFi and similar technologies work, as well as on how people tend to use their devices. Those factors do provide some reasons to think that WiFi and Bluetooth devices may be less of a concern, says Leeka Kheifets, Ph.D., a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health who has studied the potential health effects of low-level radiation."

Researchers found that the participants who took apple cider vinegar:lost more weighthad a lower body mass index (BMI)improved their cholesterol and triglyceride levelsThese findings suggest apple cider vinegar may support other proven weight loss approaches.Another small study with 20 participants looked at the effects of taking 20 milliliters of apple cider vinegar per day in water. The researchers found a lower BMI in the 10 people who were overweight and lower fasting glucose in the other 10 subjects who had type 2 diabetes.Apple cider vinegar may also cause people to feel full for longer after eating. A crossover study in the Journal of Diabetes Research notes that acetic acid, one of the compounds in apple cider vinegar, helps to slow the rate at which food leaves the stomach in healthy people and those with type 1 diabetes.It is important to note that while some studies find apple cider vinegar aids weight loss, these studies are small, with a low number of participants and only modest results. Apple cider vinegar alone is unlikely to change a person’s BMI dramatically.Other health benefitsApple cider vinegar may have other health benefits for some people. Many studies on apple cider vinegar are small, but there is early evidence to suggest it may help:control blood sugar levelssupport the treatment of varicose veinskill harmful bacteria and fungiOther studies scientists have carried out on rats show that apple cider vinegar may help with wound healing, brain health, and reducing blood pressure."

Since sexual contact is the major means by which genital herpes is transmitted, the illness does not usually arise before adolescence. When a child develops genital herpes, healthcare providers must consider the possibility of abuse. This is true whenever a person contracts a sexually transmitted disease prior to the teen years.People at heightened risk for HSV-2 infection include those who have multiple sexual partners, women, people with low incomes, and those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In fact, among people who tested positive for HIV, one study found that the prevalence of HSV-2 infections ranged from 70 to more than 90 percent."
