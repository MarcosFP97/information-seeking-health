Evidence:"Applying the tea bag to the area will allow for this acid to leak out slowly over time as your saliva wets the bag. The acid is known for aiding in blood clot formation, so it may even be better than gauze for this purpose.You can use a tea bag in the same way you use gauze, but you want to be sure that the bag is cold. Using a hot tea bag may soothe your discomfort, but it can dislodge the blood clot and cause more problems than it solves.Ice Cube and Gauze TrickSome patients find more success with stopping their bleeding if they cool their mouth’s temperature. One trick is to wrap ice cubes in gauze and place them on the extraction site.You want to avoid sucking on the ice cube or biting it.Instead, allow them to remain in the gauze and sit on the extraction site. You want to avoid placing the ice cube directly on the socket, which is why using gauze is the right choice when adding ice cubes to the process.Why is Clotting Important?The first 24 hours of healing are very important for tooth extractions and will revolve around the blood clot. Since we’ve removed your tooth, it will leave an empty socket behind where your bone exists.Blood will fill this hole and stop air from reaching the bone.Allowing the clot to form and dry fills in the empty tooth socket and will protect your bone while the area heals."

Evidence:"It is made up of amino acids, and the reason why it has been linked to arthritis relief is that these amino acids will work to protect and rebuild your joint cartilage, making it easier for you to move around. How could collagen help with arthritis? Although our body naturally produces collagen, our natural rate of production decreases with age. Marine collagen supplements are pre-digested, meaning that they make amino acids more easily available to your tissues. Taking these supplements will give your body a boost of protein, which could aid in pain relief.Taking marine collagen for arthritis could help by making the joints more elasticated, cartilage and bones more strong and could even improve muscle mass, making it perfect for anyone over a certain age looking to stay physically active and agile.

Evidence:"This might lead to a bias that underestimates the effect of mobile phones on the risk of cancer. In addition, we did not consider ipsilateral and contralateral use of the cellular phones, which is beyond the scope of our study. Lastly, although we reported exposure-response relationships between the cellular phone use and the cancer risk, it would be ideal to investigate those associations based on the actual time spent on cellular phones provided by the mobile telecommunication companies. However, most studies did not use those data. Further studies using the exact data on the time spent on cellular phones are warranted to confirm our findings.5. ConclusionsIn sum, the updated comprehensive meta-analysis of case-control studies found significant evidence linking cellular phone use to increased tumor risk, especially among cell phone users with cumulative cell phone use of 1000 or more hours in their lifetime (which corresponds to about 17 min per day over 10 years), and especially among studies that employed high quality methods."

OVERVIEW
Approximately 5-10% of all cancers are hereditary. An additional 10-30% of individuals may be at increased risk because they have close family members who also had cancer, suggesting a familial link, even though no specific hereditary link was found. There are many types of familial cancers. For example, in certain families, women have a higher propensity to develop breast and/or ovarian cancer. This is known as Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome (HBOC), which is often caused by an inherited mutation in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene (BRCA1/2). Harmful variants in BRCA1/2 may lead to an increased chance of developing other cancers as well, such as fallopian tube, peritoneal, melanoma, pancreas, and/or prostate cancer."

The argument was deteriorating into an “us versus them” conflict, and evidence, facts, or objective findings did not seem to matter a great deal. Anahad O’Connor and Gardiner Harris, science writers for the New York Times, uncovered disturbing evidence of hostility against researchers who reject the vaccine/autism connection.Since the [Center for Disease Control] report’s release, scientists and health officials have been bombarded with hostile e-mail messages and phone calls.

Whether you’re setting records in the gym or going for a run, you’ve likely experienced knee pain. In fact, chronic knee pain affects about 25% of adults, according to the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. It’s one of the most common sports– and workout-related injuries there is, and that pesky pain can hinder even the toughest athlete from getting reps in on the squat rack. “Most commonly, the knee pain people refer to in the gym has to do with the anterior (front) part of the knee,” says David Otey, C.S.C.S., a personal training manager at Equinox."

Introduction
Arterial hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor and represents a significant public health problem that affects more than one billion adults and is presumed responsible for almost 7 million deaths each year worldwide [1]. The advent of antihypertensive therapy rendered more than 100 antihypertensive drugs available on the market for the effective management of arterial hypertension. Each therapeutic class targets a specific mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and has its own advantages and disadvantages, indications and contraindications."

Morphine addiction
Description
Morphine is an alkaloid from the plant extracts of opium poppy. Although morphine is highly effective for the treatment of pain, it is also known to be intensely addictive. We now know that the most important brain-reward circuit involves dopamine (DA) -containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and their target areas in the limbic forebrain, in particular, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and frontal regions of cerebral cortex. Morphine can cause indirect excitation of VTA dopamine neurons by reducing inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABAergic neurons. The chronic use of morphine is characterized by adaptive changes in neurons and neuronal communication; such adaptations (e.g., 'superactivation' of adenylyl cyclase) must underlie altered behaviour associated with morphine dependence and withdrawal syndrome, as well as drug-induced craving and relapse to drug use."

Evidence:"They also looked at consumption of apple, orange, grapefruit, and “other” fruit juices. People who ate at least two servings each week of certain whole fruits — particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples — reduced their risk for type 2 diabetes by as much as 23% in comparison to those who ate less than one serving per month. Conversely, those who consumed one or more servings of fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 21%. The researchers found that swapping three servings of juice per week for whole fruits would result in a 7% reduction in diabetes risk. The fruits’ glycemic index (a measure of how rapidly carbohydrates in a food boost blood sugar) did not prove to be a significant factor in determining a fruit’s association with type 2 diabetes risk. However, the high glycemic index of fruit juice — which passes through the digestive system more rapidly than fiber-rich fruit — may explain the positive link between juice consumption and increased diabetes risk."

 Why Sit Ups Might be Bad for Your Low Back			 June 20, 2019/in Uncategorized /by Dennis McGee, DCMany of our patients are surprised to learn that sit ups can be bad for the low back. Sit ups and crunches are a common exercise done to strengthen the abdominal muscles, but researchers tell us that sit ups can damage the lumbar discs and they can even strengthen the wrong muscles. Compression
During a sit up, the lumbar spine bends forward. This forward bending causes increased compression on the lumbar discs. The typical sit up creates about 700 pounds of compressive force on the intervertebral disc. Doing sit ups repetitively, over time can damage the lumbar discs."

Evidence:"(The web is full of references to high IQ society claiming that 20 percent of its members are left-handed, but a call to the high IQ society revealed they do not track such data.) Famous lefty super geniuses include Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin and Sir Isaac Newton, according to lefthandersday.com . Some suggest that “left-handed genius” stems from being forced to use both sides of the brain more often, allowing lefties to process large amounts of information more readily, according to anythinglefthanded.co.uk , but the evidence to support that claim is largely contradictory. In fact, the most recent study by Joshua Goodman, an associate professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, found lefties scored about 10 to 12 percent less than righties on “measures of cognitive skill”, even after controlling for health as babies and family background.5 (Several studies in the 1970s and 80s linked birth stress to handedness, but more recent reports are less conclusive.) Looking at five large studies of individuals in the U.S. and United Kingdom, and data on education and employment, Goodman further found lefties also had more behavioral and speech problems and were more likely to have learning disabilities. Lefties work in more manually intensive occupations than do righties, further suggesting that lefties’ primary labor market disadvantage is cognitive rather than physical,” Goodman writes in his 2014 abstract."

Evidence:"Though similar to a lymphatic drainage massage in that it reduces swelling caused by water retention, Miracle Sculpt has the added benefit of working on areas of stored fat as well. The suctioning maneuvers break up the fat deposits while the massage strokes push the fat deposits and retained water through the body so they can be eliminated by the lymphatic system, helping the body get rid of both excess fat and liquids. As lymphatic drainage massage affects the more superficial tissues that cause cellulite, the result is a smoother, more even skin tone in the areas where a client has cellulite. The strokes used in Miracle Sculpt are unique in that they use a suctioning and massage strokes together to not only reduce inflammation and bloating but also break up fat deposits, significantly reducing the appearance of cellulite.

However, there are a few health implications that are more common in vegans, so if you’re considering going vegan you should be aware of these and take steps to prevent them.“The main health implications of being vegan are nutritional,” says Mathew. “Anaemia is a key one, especially for women, so it’s really important to ensure you get enough iron in your diet.

Methanol is non-toxic, but its metabolites (formic acid, methanol) are incredibly toxic. The main toxic effects do not become apparent until methanol is metabolized to formic acid and accumulates to toxic levels. Therefore, clinical symptoms typically evolve within 6 to 24 h but can be postponed to 72 to 96 h if ethanol is co-ingested (7). Initially, the patient became drowsy, unsteady, and out of control, and is often unnoticed.

When most people think about sun-related damage, they probably worry about their skin. But the sun’s ultraviolet rays also pose a threat to a person’s eyes. According to a 2014 study funded by the U.S. National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, UV radiation can damage proteins in the eye’s lens. Over time, this damage can raise a person’s risk for cataracts, which impair vision."
Question:Can sunglasses help prevent cataracts?

Evidence:"The majority of HIV researchers subscribe to the bushmeat theory and raise several arguments against the OPV theory. Hahn's recent research confirming that HIV-1 M and N arose from Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps in Cameroon presents one problem: The Kisangani lab is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it's home to a different subspecies of chimp than the one that was the source of HIV-1 M and N. However, it is possible that the chimps used in the Kisangani experiments were not from the area. In the spring of 2006, Hooper found a paper indicating that at least one of eight chimps at the Kisangani lab was a Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The 1959 sample also presents a problem for the OPV theory. Judging by how fast the virus mutates, it had already diverged significantly from its SIV ancestors by the time doctors extracted it from a patient. However, the African polio vaccination program had begun only two years earlier, so under the OPV theory, the virus would have had only those two years in which to evolve."
Question:Did AIDS come from chimps?

Evidence:"Conclusions:  Among subjects with early mild cognitive impairment and low to moderate serum cholesterol levels at baseline, lipophilic statin use was associated with more than double the risk of converting to dementia over eight years of follow-up compared with statin non-use, and with highly significant decline in metabolism of posterior cingulate cortex -- the region of the brain known to decline the most significantly in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, no such clinical or metabolic decline was found for users of other statins, nor statin users having higher baseline serum cholesterol levels. Previous

Evidence:"The vitamin C you consume naturally plays important roles in your body, but does taking a megadose of it actually provide benefit? Can a vitamin C supplement really keep you from getting sick? Despite it's popularity as a remedy for the common cold, there's actually no evidence to suggest that a large dose of vitamin C can actually prevent one — or any other type of illness, for that matter. And while you may have heard that a large dose of vitamin C can slightly reduce the duration of a cold, this only applies if you take that large dose every single day of the year — even when you're not sick. This means that if you rip that vitamin C packet open after your symptoms begin, there's no evidence to suggest it'll actually shorten the length of your cold. As it turns out, boosting your immune system is more complicated than just downing a packet or a pill."

Evidence:"Previous observational studies have linked drinking coffee with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, yet coffee’s effects on blood sugar metabolism have not been well defined. In the current study, coffee did not affect the study participants’ sensitivity to insulin – the hormone that regulates sugar levels in the blood. The study did yield an unexpected result: Drinking coffee was associated with a modest loss of body fat. According to a January 13, 2020 HealthDay News article, Derrick Alperet, a study coauthor and research fellow in the Department of Nutrition, and colleagues think that the fat loss may be due to the caffeine in coffee increasing the drinker’s metabolism, which may burn more calories and cause a decrease in body fat.

Evidence:"Sausages, beef jerky, hot dogs, ham, and cured meats like prosciutto and salami all fall into this category.In an October 2015 report, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) warned that consuming processed meats such as deli slices and cured meats on a daily basis increases colorectal cancer risk by 18 percent. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosis and cause of death by cancer in the United States.In the IARC report, Kurt Straif, MD, MPH, head of the division that identifies preventable causes of cancer, said that the amount of processed meats eaten on a global scale is what makes this finding substantial.“For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” said Dr. Straif.The ANSES report recommends that the industry eventually adjusts the amount of nitrates in processed meats to the lowest level possible while still ensuring product safety.NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Diet and Nutrition Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Unlike warts, skin tags don’t spread to other parts of the body or to other people, even through direct contact. Removing one skin tag doesn’t directly lead to the growth of new tags, either. Some people might notice new skin tags after having one removed from a certain part of the body. However, this simply means that the affected area is more prone to skin tags by default.5."

The virus can be spread when someone with HSV has an ‘episode’ or an outbreak – characterised by having a sore, blister, ulcer or skin split (this is known as viral shedding). It can also be spread between episodes, when there is no sore, blister, ulcer or skin split present – called asymptomatic viral shedding. During viral shedding the virus is on the skin surface and can be spread through genital skin-to-skin contact, or from the mouth or face to genital skin during contact.
