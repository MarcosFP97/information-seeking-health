Evidence:"The achilles tendon connects your heel to your calf and helps with movement and flexing of the foot. Achilles Tendonitis is inflammation of the achilles tendon and is often caused by overuse, increasing activity too quickly, tight calf muscles, or flat feet. If you are injured, the area on the back of your foot above your heel may hurt, your achilles may feel tender or tight, and it might be difficult for you to move your foot. Severe injuries can involve the rupture of your achilles tendon, you might hear and feel a pop when this occurs and you may experience severe pain. Aside from the typical rest, ice, compression and elevation for your foot treatment, wearing a brace to support your achilles tendon and applying a compression sleeve to your calf can help alleviate pain. An ankle brace like the Trizone Ankle offers the same benefits of taping you might consider for applying pressure and improving arch support."

Evidence:"Dementia is a substantial public health concern in China due to the increasing number of older adults.Therefore, academics from Tianjin Medical School randomly assigned 168 people with mild cognitive impairment to folic acid supplementation or conventional-treatment groups.The researchers recorded significant improvements in cognitive function among the supplementation group, particularly in memory tasks.“Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines…in the treatment group during the follow-up period,”​ they wrote in the journal Scientific Reports.​The reduction in peripheral inflammatory cytokines is significant because they have emerged as a useful source for predicting individuals who are at a greater risk of developing dementia.Preclinical periodSeveral population-based studies have reported an association between peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels and the risk of cognitive impairment/dementia.“Dementia develops over a long preclinical period, and its association with inflammatory markers may be a consequence of the disease process rather than a causal association,” ​the researchers wrote.“Therefore, investigations of the role of inflammatory markers in the early stages of the disease process where cognitive decline is apparent but has not yet developed into the full clinical dementia syndrome are important. In this context, we selected individuals suffering from MCI and utilized a folic acid intervention to attenuate inflammation, as we believe this treatment would be a feasible public health strategy for preventing dementia.”​They concluded that folic acid has significant anti-inflammatory and memory-enhancing properties.“Supplementing the subjects’ diets with 400mg of folic acid daily for twelve months significantly improved their cognitive performance and reduced systemic inflammation. ​“Cognitive improvement resulting from folic acid supplementation depends on regulating the peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels. Folic acid is a promising treatment for individuals with mild cognitive impairment,” they added.​Source: Scientific Reports​doi:  10.1038/srep37486​“Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function by reducing the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines in elderly Chinese subjects with MCI”.​Authors: Fej Ma, et al​.

Some have been inconclusive, but other studies seem to indicate some kind of association.Here are a few:A 2017 study looked at the impact of low serum selenium on survival of women with breast cancer. The research suggested that a selenium level over 64.4 µg//L (micrograms per liter) might be beneficial for women in treatment for breast cancer.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In 2 studies, zinc was incorporated directly into the prenatal supplements (12, 14); of these studies, only one reported significant improvements in maternal serum zinc concentrations during pregnancy in zinc-supplemented women (14). The women in these studies (11–14), however, had higher intakes of zinc and iron than would be true for most women in developing countries. Because maternal needs for both zinc and iron during pregnancy appear to influence zinc absorption and metabolism (15), the relevance of these findings for women in developing countries is not clear.As part of a randomized trial of maternal zinc supplementation and pregnancy outcome and maternal and infant health, Peruvian women were randomly assigned to receive prenatal iron and folate supplements with or without zinc. Because Peruvian guidelines indicate universal prenatal iron supplementation, we could not directly assess the effect of iron supplementation on zinc status; however, we could examine whether adding zinc to prenatal iron and folate tablets improved the zinc status of these women during pregnancy and of their neonates at delivery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Between 1995 and 1997, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal zinc supplementation to improve maternal and infant health was conducted at the Hospital Materno Infantil “Cesar Lopez Silva” in Villa El Salvador, an impoverished shantytown in Lima, Peru. Previous information indicated some degree of maternal zinc deficiency in this area."

Overall, the researchers found that taking evening primrose or borage oil offered no clear improvement of eczema symptoms over placebos. Commonly used placebos included olive oil and paraffin oil. There was also no improvement in quality of life with the complementary therapies, although only two studies considered this measure. "There is no evidence that taking either evening primrose or borage oil is of benefit to eczema sufferers," said lead researcher Joel Bamford of the University of Minnesota Medical School and Essentia Health System in Duluth, Minnesota, US. "Given the strength of the evidence in our review, we think further studies on the use of these complementary therapies to treat eczema would be hard to justify.""

Evidence:"Migraine sufferers are especially likely to be lacking in magnesium.Can magnesium help prevent migraine attacks?According to multiple scientific studies, the American Headache Society, and the American Academy of Neurology, the answer is yes. Not every clinical trial has shown magnesium to be effective at preventing migraine headaches, but there’s enough evidence that it helps that it’s a good option to consider.How can it help? Experts think magnesium may help prevent the wave of brain signaling, called a cortical spreading depression, that is thought to cause migraine. It can also reduce pain during an attack by blocking pain-transmitting chemicals in the brain.Research suggests that it’s especially helpful for people who have migraine with aura or menstrual migraine. Scientists believe it may help prevent aura by stopping your brain from producing the signals that cause it, but they aren’t quite sure why it’s so effective against menstrual migraine.What other conditions can magnesium help with?Magnesium isn’t just beneficial for migraine sufferers.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"However, because the pancreas cannot keep up the necessary pace, blood glucose levels eventually rise.Exercise helps counter the effects of type 2 diabetes in several ways. It increases insulin sensitivity, which helps the cells use any available insulin to take up glucose from the blood. Also, when muscle cells contract during exercise, they are able to take in glucose even when insulin is unavailable. The blood glucose-lowering effects of exercise last up to about 24 hours following a workout.Although all exercise helps counter the effects of diabetes by promoting weight loss and increasing insulin sensitivity, the specific types below provide additional advantages:Aerobic exercise: Regular aerobic training lowers blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and A1C test results, which provide the average blood glucose level of the past 2–3 months. Research has linked moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise to substantially lower cardiovascular and overall death risks in people with diabetes.Resistance exercise: Diabetes is a risk factor for poor muscle strength. Resistance training helps counter this effect, as it increases muscle mass and strength.Other types of exercise: Older adults with diabetes tend to have limitations in balance and flexibility."

Evidence:"“The morning is when your body is most likely to stimulate these mood centers in your brain,” she said. In other words, the light's capacity to boost your mood is highest in the A.M.However, we know that there is less intense natural light in the winter, which is why you may want to consider buying a light therapy lamp. One of the best things about light therapy lamps is that they’re a low-risk, low-side-effect intervention for seasonal depression that can be very effective, according to Stern.Light therapy lamps typically help 80% of people with seasonal depression, if you get the right lamp and use it properly, Hoffman said. There are, however, certain conditions or medications, like photosensitizing antibiotics, that can make light therapy inadvisable. Therefore, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting treatment.For example, people with eye conditions that affect the retina, which can happen with diabetes, may want to avoid light exposure. Those with bipolar disorder can be extra sensitive to light, so you may need to work with a healthcare professional to find the right amount."

Evidence:"There were 6 primary outcome measures. The primary outcome measures were chosen because they represent the spectrum of the key symptoms responsible for disability in migraine and measure both the early (2-hour) and sustained (24-hour) relief of these symptoms. The first 4 of these outcome measures, which compared sumatriptan–naproxen sodium with placebo, were the percentages of patients who had headache relief 2 hours after dosing (ie, the reduction of pain from moderate/severe intensity to mild/no pain without use of rescue medication at each of the prespecified time points), absence of photophobia, absence of phonophobia, and absence of nausea. The other 2 outcome measures, which compared sumatriptan–naproxen sodium with its individual components, were the percentages of patients with sustained pain-free response (ie, moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to no pain from 2 hours through 24 hours after dosing with no use of rescue medication). A secondary efficacy outcome measure 2 hours after dosing was the percentage of patients with pain-free response (moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to no pain). Secondary efficacy outcome measures also included the percentages of patients with sustained headache relief (ie, moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to mild or no pain from 2 hours through 24 hours after dosing, with no use of rescue medication); sustained freedom from nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia from 2 through 24 hours after dosing; use of rescue medication through 24 hours after dosing; and headache recurrence (ie, return of moderate or severe pain within 24 hours of dosing among patients with headache relief 2 hours after dosing)."

Evidence:"We also provide some ideas for alternative remedies and treatments.RisksShare on PinterestThe ingredients in some toothpastes may be harsh on the skin.Historically, toothpaste contained an antibacterial agent called triclosan. However, in 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned triclosan as an ingredient in antiseptic washes after finding evidence to suggest that it can decrease thyroid hormone levels and potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance.As of early 2019, commercially available toothpaste no longer contains triclosan.Toothpaste contains many ingredients that benefit dental health, such as:glycerinsorbitolcalcium carbonatesodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)However, many of these ingredients are too harsh to use on the skin. People may find that toothpaste irritates or dries their skin out. This effect could be particularly dangerous for those with dry or sensitive skin.Having overly dry skin can stimulate excess oil production, which could, in turn, trigger further breakouts of spots and pimples.Having a new pimple pop up the night before a big event or experiencing a stubborn breakout that lingers for weeks on end can be frustrating. However, before people reach for their toothpaste, they may wish to consider the following alternative pimple remedies instead.MedicationPeople who experience frequent breakouts can try using over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription strength acne treatments.Although these treatments can be highly effective, they may also lead to side effects and might not be right for everyone.

After the AMA Journal criticized Hoxsey as a "cancer charlatan" in 1949, Hoxsey tried to silence the organization with a defamation suit.

      The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at 15 studies involving over 190,000 people to determine how much exercise was needed to reduce depression. Adults who did activities equivalent to 1.25 hours of brisk walking per week had an 18% lower risk of depression compared with those who did not exercise, the study said. Moving up to an “activity volume equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking per week was associated with 25% lower risk of depression,” the study authors said. Adobe Stock

Evidence:"The majority of these are myths and using them for tick removal could actually make the situation worse. Myth 1: Use Petroleum Jelly
Some sources on tick removal suggest that covering the embedded tick with petroleum jelly will suffocate the tick and force it to back out. The fact is, petroleum jelly does not force the tick to back out and may actually cause the tick to release additional toxins into your pet’s body. Myth 2: Use Nail Polish or Polish Remover
Due to its acidic properties, many believe that nail polish or nail polish remover is caustic to ticks and that covering the tick with either of these chemicals will force the tick to back out. The truth is, nail polish and nail polish remover won’t get rid of the tick, can be harmful to your pet’s skin, and may cause chemical burns if applied to your pet’s body.

Evidence:"This means a healthy coating of thick, pungent mayo must remain on your child’s scalp and in their hair for eight hours in order for it to have any success in killing their head lice. Yet that will only address part of the problem. While mayonnaise may help kill some bugs, it has no effect whatsoever on their eggs, or nits. Without killing or physically removing every nit in the hair, a new generation of lice will hatch, and the infestation will remain active. Instead of slathering mayonnaise onto your kids’ heads and crossing your fingers, pay a visit to the experts in lice treatment: Lice Clinics of America – Columbus. Our patented AirAllé heated air device dehydrates and kills over 99% of lice and eggs in just one hour."

Over-the-counter antifungal creams are sufficient for treating most cases of athlete's foot. Apply them as directed to the toes and foot. Common brands include clotrimazole (Lotrimin) and terbinafine (Lamasil).If the topical antifungal medications do not clear up the infection, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication.If you are unsure of your diagnosis and/or you plan to visit a physician within the next month, the application of 1% hydrocortisone cream purchased over the counter would be a reasonable therapeutic tactic.

Evidence:"Results of random-effects meta-analysis showed omega-3 fatty acids exhibited an overall significant decreasing effect on overall BPD symptoms severity, with a standardized difference in means (SDM) of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.91-0.17) and no heterogeneity. The researchers observed significant effects on affect dysregulation (SDM = 0.74; 95% CI, 1.21-0.27) and impulsive behavior (SDM = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.84-0.059) according to a priori differentiation of relevant symptom domains. Effects on cognitive-perceptual symptoms did not reach the threshold for significance. “Marine omega-3 fatty acids could be presented as an (add-on) treatment option for BPD patients in a shared decision-making context,” Karaszewska and colleagues wrote. “As with all supplement interventions, it is important to stress that they do not form an alternative to a healthy diet and lifestyle, and they are not free from side effects, although side effects are generally considered manageable. Clinically relevant effects could be particularly expected on impulsivity and affective symptom domains.”

Evidence:"Whether vitamin D can be employed clinically to control childhood asthma remains to be verified due to inconsistent findings (12–17). Through the analysis of 8 high-quality RCTs (16, 17, 20–25), we directly compared the influences of vitamin D and placebos on the treatment for childhood asthma, and this is the first meta-analysis based on RCTs exploring the effects and safety of vitamin D supplementation on childhood asthma. Our meta-analysis provides the latest clinical evidence that vitamin D supplementation can significantly enhance serum vitamin D levels, which fails to improve asthma control for pediatric patients. However, vitamin D supplementation may reduce patients' lung function. Regarding vitamin D toxicity, the pooled outcomes showed similar results between the two groups in the form of AEs. Compared with the placebos, vitamin D affected serum vitamin D levels in a stronger way."
