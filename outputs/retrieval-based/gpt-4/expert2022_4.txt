Evidence:"Pressure and Clotting
Tea bags also provide a soft but solid mass that you can bite down on firmly but gently. When you bite down, that increases the pressure on the extraction site. Pressure, of course, promotes good clotting and stopped bleeding. While you could continue to use gauze, the moisture in the tea bag may make the site feel more comfortable to you, compared to having dry gauze rubbing against your gums. Tea Types and Tannins
As mentioned, green or black tea is necessary. While some herbal teas contain tannins, those teas are not known for their effects on bleeding."

Evidence:"One common belief is that crystals interact with the body’s energy fields, also known as vibrational energy. The idea is that crystals can redirect and re-channel energy flow with their unique energetic vibrations, helping to unblock areas of the body or energy field that have become “stuck.”“Crystals have potent healing powers, and when we touch them, healing is immediately activated,” says cosmic energy healer Eva Antoniadou. As the crystal vibrations interact with the body’s natural energetic frequency, the body is said to be left feeling focused, relaxed, and clear. “Crystals absorb energy from pressure and movement and convert it into an electronic frequency,” says Polack. “It’s this frequency, unique to each type of crystal, that users are relying on when working with crystals, and given that many pain and anxiety relief devices work on similar principles, we do believe they can help in these areas.”Methods of treating pain and other disorders with electrical current include:radiofrequency ablation (RFA)electronic muscle stimulation (EMS)transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Compared to these therapies, any frequency a crystal might emit would be infinitesimal.

Evidence:"I turned to the scholarly literature, and quickly found a meta-analysis, published in the journal International Orthopaedics, claiming to summarize the most rigorous research on oral collagen supplements and osteoarthritis. The authors found 114 published articles and winnowed them down to just five that had assigned patients at random to take collagen or a placebo. After calculating a weighted average of the trial results, the authors concluded that “collagen is effective in improving [osteoarthritis] symptoms.”
Halfway through the article, though, I was starting to have doubts. I’m a statistician who’s published research on meta-analysis. This one, as I pointed out in a letter to the journal that had published it, was full of red flags. The first red flag was that the results were all over the place."

Evidence:"Since mosquito bites are usually an inconsequential annoyance, you might not even connect your headache or fever to the mosquito bite you had three days before. If you’re experiencing symptoms or sickly feelings, knowing that you were bitten and passing this information along to your doctor can lead to the right diagnosis — especially if you have been exposed to a mosquito-borne illness. Symptoms to Look for: The three most common symptoms of mosquito-borne illnesses are:
Fever
Fatigue
Headache
Whether you have recently traveled somewhere where outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses are common or you’ve recently been bit at home, if you’re experiencing any of these symptoms – visit your doctor, even if the mosquito bite has completely healed. Diseases You Can Catch From Mosquitoes: What are some of the most common mosquito-borne illnesses? Watch out for the following symptoms, especially if you have traveled anywhere where there are outbreaks:
West Nile Virus — West Nile Virus is spread by mosquitoes and can lead to meningitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, back and body aches, stiff neck, vomiting or nausea."

Evidence:"Damaged cancer susceptibility genes can be inherited, and passed on, by men just as easily as women. If a parent carries a cancer susceptibility gene, each of their children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene, and thus the susceptibility to cancer. Each child also has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the working copy of the gene, in which case their cancer risk would be no higher than that of the general population. It should be noted that some cancer susceptibility genes only have links to cancers that may not be seen in both sexes, such as ovarian and prostate cancers. Parents of the unaffected sex can still carry and pass on these genes. Hereditary cancers generally are not significantly different from non-hereditary cancers."

Evidence:"Squatting is a functional move. It helps you do activities in your daily life, such as getting pots out of a bottom cabinet or picking up shoes off the floor. Squatting also helps build strength in the legs and hips, and stronger muscles mean more stable joints. But if you don’t squat correctly, it can be painful to sore knees. Too many people compensate for sore knees by bending over at the waist, which can lead to a sore back, says Cynthia Harrell, physical therapist and clinical coordinator of the arthritis and osteoporosis programs at the Duke Center for Living at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The Right Way to Squat 
For example, when you go to reach into a low cabinet hold on to the countertop and “sit” down, using the muscles in your arms and buttocks for lowering and pulling yourself up."

Evidence:"The researchers attribute the initial decline in sexual interaction to the psychological effects of hypertension diagnosis and first treatment, and conclude that the "low incidence of sexual dysfunction with ACE inhibitors [is] probably due to the fact that these drugs work through channels other than the sympathetic nervous system in lowering [blood pressure]." What Does Cause Erectile Dysfunction? While it seems that the connection between lisinopril, ACE inhibitors, and erectile dysfunction is slim at best, there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction. In general, conditions that negatively impact the strength of blood flow or volume will have a negative impact on erections. The most common physical issues that are connected to erectile dysfunction are high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. For every underlying condition or "co-morbidity", your risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases; however, erectile dysfunction is not just a physical condition."

Evidence:"Although some studies suggest that the addictive potential of morphine decreases when it is used to treat neuropathic pain, this has not been studied in a SCI model. Accordingly, the present studies investigated the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI using conditioned place preference (CPP) and intravenous self-administration paradigms. A contusion injury significantly increased the expression of a CPP relative to sham and intact controls in the acute phase of injury. However, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than sham and intact controls, but this was dose-dependent; at a high concentration, injured rats exhibited an increase in drug-reinforced responses over time. Exposure to a high concentration of morphine impeded weight gain and locomotor recovery. We suggest that the increased preference observed in injured rats reflects a motivational effect linked in part to the drug's anti-nociceptive effect."

Evidence:"However, recent research has shown that they are not nearly as good for us as we think. One study that we covered on Medical News Today in July this year, for instance, indicated that they could increase a person’s risk of cancer.Now, research from an international team of investigators from Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, MA and Fudan University in Shanghai, China, suggests that all sugary drinks, including natural fruit juices and artificially sweetened beverages, could increase diabetes risk.However, the study, which appears in the journal Diabetes Care, also offers some hope. It notes that people can decrease this risk by replacing sugary drinks of any kind with non-sweetened beverages, such as water, tea, and coffee.“The study provides further evidence demonstrating the health benefits associated with decreasing sugary beverage consumption and replacing these drinks with healthier alternatives like water, coffee, or tea.”First author Jean-Philippe Drouin-Chartier, Ph.D.Sugary drinks linked to 16% increase in riskDrouin-Chartier and colleagues analyzed data collected over 22–26 years from 76,531 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study between 1986–2012, 81,597 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II between 1991–2013, and 34,224 men from the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study, enrolled between 1986–2012.The researchers gave the participants questionnaires that asked them how often they consumed certain foods and beverages. By analyzing the results, the study authors found out how often participants drank certain sugary drinks and were able to calculate any changes in their drink consumption patterns.The researchers found that people who increased their total intake of soft drinks with added sugars and naturally sweet fruit drinks by over 4 ounces (oz) per day over 4 years saw an associated diabetes risk increase of 16% over the following 4 years.However, those who increased their total intake of artificially sweetened beverages — such as diet soda — by the same quantity over the same period saw an associated 18% increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.These associations remained in place even after the researchers adjusted for confounding variables, including body mass index (BMI), different dietary changes, and relevant lifestyle habits.The investigators caution, however, that the finding regarding artificially sweetened beverages may be unreliable because it remains unclear which way the association runs. They explain that people who know that they are already at high risk of developing diabetes may switch from sugary drinks to diet sodas to try and mitigate that risk.Moreover, the study authors also point out the risk of surveillance bias in their research. This refers to the fact that people who are at high risk of developing diabetes are more likely to undergo screenings for diabetes, therefore receiving a diagnosis sooner than other individuals.Overall, the research suggests that people might want to consider caution about their intake of sweet drinks of all kinds."

Evidence:"Research has not shown any benefit with use of copper or magnets
for arthritic pain.”
Occupational
therapist Karen Jacobs, EdD, OT, OTR, CPE, FAOTA, who works with arthritis
patients on a regular basis, also doesn’t recommend them. “With copper
bracelets, there isn’t any evidence research to support its use,” says Jacobs, who
is also a clinical professor at Boston University. “A search of the evidence
literature does not indicated that wearing a copper bracelet reduces pain and
swelling.”
Here’s
what the science found. About five years ago, the first randomized controlled
study to assess copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps was conducted by researchers
at the University of York in the UK. Seventy rheumatoid arthritis patients with
symptoms wore either copper, magnet, or placebo bracelets over a five-month period
and reported on how they felt; they were also given blood tests to check
inflammation levels. The results: Neither the copper nor the magnets were any
more effective than the placebo."

Evidence:"Another reason besides back pain associated with the sit up is neck strain, this is due to clasping the hands behind the head, but this can result in individuals pulling on their head for leverage and thereby can possibly injure their neck muscles and connective tissues. Avoiding spine flexion is not necessary for everyone; it really depends on how you spend the rest of your days. If you are like the majority of people out there sitting at a computer all day, you are constantly sitting in a flexed position. So for someone like this the last thing we want them to do is go exercise by sitting or flexing the spine even more. Now if you are an individual who stands all day or spends most of the day on your feet then flexion type exercises may not be so bad, and in fact may be encouraged. Top 4 tips for getting started

Evidence:"All 16 had reverted to writing with their natural hand and, according to the authors, their stuttering either ceased or was substantially ameliorated. Other researchers, including Orton, reported similar findings. Reviewing the past two decades of research on “the study of handedness and its relation to speech,” renowned London neurologist W. Russell Brain (1885–1966) reported in The Lancet in 1945 that “there is considerable evidence correlating stuttering with anomalies of handedness.”
Although most experts no longer see a direct cause and effect between hand switching and stuttering, they nevertheless oppose forcing left-handers to convert to right-handed writing. Despite the “early and impressive statistical reports” psychologist Lauren Julius Harris, writing in 1990, concluded that the evidence that retraining caused stuttering was weak. Still, he admitted that we “know little more on this question [than] in the 1930s” because studies since then “have ignored the question of hand training and have focused on the broader question of whether speech disorders are more common in left-handers generally.”
I hope my forthcoming book will reawaken interest in determining whether there is a link between left-handedness and stuttering, not least of all because, unlike in the U.S. and Europe, most of the planet’s left-handers remain subjected to discrimination and retraining.

Here are the massages to tackle it - and how they workMassages can help reduce cellulite and this is a goal shared by many. While dimples may look cute on the cheeks of children, they’re suddenly a lot less desirable when they’re lodged in our thighs and bottom. For many women, cellulite can cause distress to the point they stop wearing the clothes they’d like to wear; but it is a very common skin problem.What is cellulite?Anyone can develop cellulite, regardless of size. Put simply, it occurs as a result of bulged up fat deposits under the skin, causing lumpy irregularities mainly over the buttocks, thighs and stomachs of many women (although it can also affect some men). When these fat cells build up between connective tissues, it pulls on and protrudes through different areas on the dermis layer of skin; causing those pesky dimples.How to get rid of cellulite?Although there’s no miracle cure for cellulite, there are ways to help reduce it."

Evidence:"While DHA and EPA are both omega-3s, they have different effects on cholesterol levels. To that end, a study from Current Atherosclerosis Reports suggests the following:
DHA and EPA can both reduce “bad” triglycerides
DHA can raise levels of “good” HDL cholesterol, while EPA may not
DHA can raise levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, while EPA may not
The bottom line: Does fish oil improve cholesterol levels? Overall, fish oil can have a largely positive impact on cholesterol. Several studies have demonstrated that fish oil—both in fresh and supplement forms—can lower your triglycerides while increasing your “good” cholesterol numbers (HDL).,
While increased LDL levels are also possible after ingesting fish oil, the overall benefits of fish oil are hard to ignore. That said, the best results seem to come from fish oil supplements that contain DHA and EPA. Knowing what are good cholesterol numbers and how to test cholesterol at home can help track how these supplements can aid in controlling your numbers."

Evidence:"While the evidence isn’t very strong for the vegan diet specifically, Cade says, the vegan diet seems to be linked to better general health, apart from bone density and fractures, which may be more common due to possible lower calcium intake, and the likelihood of B12 deficiency. (Read more about whether we should drink dairy milk to strengthen bones). Vegans have a lower body mass index (BMI) which means better cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.Flax seed is rich in essential omega 3, which a vegan diet can lack (Credit: Getty Images)The vegan diet is much like any other. It can help to lower your risk of disease, or increase it – depending on the foods you eat. “If you compare a plant-based diet with an unhealthy diet that includes meat, the plant-based diet is certainly better,” Faidon says. “But if you follow a relatively prudent omnivorous diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, which is high in fruit, vegetables, legumes and low in meat, there’s evidence to suggest this type of omnivorous diet is at least as healthy as a vegan diet,” he says."

Older men tend to get more UTIs than younger men. I usually see men get recurrent infections when they do not properly empty their bladder because of an enlarged prostate. Men may not empty their bladder for other reasons such as nerve damage from stroke, diabetes or trauma to the spine. Men also can get infections that start from their prostate or even their testicles that travel up into the bladder  — or the opposite can happen when an infection goes from the bladder to the other body parts. Infections also can happen if kidney stones block the flow of urine. Younger men also may develop urinary infections because of sexually transmitted diseases."

A less obvious concern is the potential risk of acoustic damage to the fetus, due to the loud tapping noises generated by the coils of the MR scanner as they are subjected to rapidly oscillating electromagnetic currents, especially with EPI, which is the noisiest sequence in current clinical use. In a follow-up study of 18 patients who had undergone EPI as fetuses, 16 passed their 8 month hearing test, compared to 16.7 expected [1]. In a second study, a microphone was passed through the esophagus into the fluid filled stomach of a volunteer [2]. The aim was to simulate the acoustic environment of the gravid uterus.

Some Statins Appear to Increase Dementia in Patients With Mild Cognitive Issues
By staff
Does the use of some of the most commonly prescribed statins significantly increase the risk of developing dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment?Research presented at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2021 Annual Meeting advises that positron emission tomography (PET) scans of lipophilic statin users revealed a highly significant decline in metabolism in the area of the brain that is first impacted by Alzheimer's disease when those cholesterol-lowering drugs were used in certain circumstances.In other words, according to the University of California at Los Angeles authors, taking lipophilic statins—which include atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and pitavastatin—appears to more than double those patients’ risk of developing dementia compared with those who do not take statins. While hydrophilic statins focus on the liver, lipophilic statins are distributed to tissues throughout the body.“There have been many conflicting studies on the effects of statin drugs on cognition,” said Prasanna Padmanabham, project head of the statins and cognition in the molecular and medical pharmacology student research program at UCLA. “While some claim that statins protect users against dementia, others assert that they accelerate the development of dementia. Our study aimed to clarify the relationship between statin use and subject’s long-term cognitive trajectory.”The study team looked at several factors:• Neuropsychological status at baseline, • Relatively high versus low serum cholesterol levels at baseline• Statin use versus nonuse • Among users, type of statin used. “The present analysis focuses upon outcomes of subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), comparing users of statins with known moderate (atorvastatin) or high (simvastatin) lipophilicity and blood-brain barrier penetrance (LS), to non-users (nonS), or users of other statins (OS),” the authors explain.Participants were enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative at over 50 North American sites. The patients were then grouped into those above (n = 103) or below (n = 200) the median cholesterol level of the nonuser subjects (206 mg/dl).Researchers report that, while serum cholesterol levels at baseline ranged widely (101-358 mg/dl), among all eMCI subjects, the average baseline cholesterol levels did not significantly differ between those who converted to dementia within 96 months as opposed to those who did not.After excluding statin users with less than 96 months of use, the below-median cholesterol group consisted of 157 patients—67 nonusers, 72 on lipophilic statins, and 18 on other statins; within that group, according to researchers, average serum levels also did not differ between those who did (166 mg/dl) and did not (171 mg/dl) convert to dementia."

For comparison, the RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.At that time, no reliable studies had proved this to be true.But in the following few decades, multiple randomized controlled studies examined whether the vitamin had any effect on the common cold.The results have been fairly disappointing.An analysis of 29 studies including 11,306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of catching a cold (1).However, regular vitamin C supplements had several benefits, including:Reduced cold severity: They reduced the symptoms of a cold, making it less severe.Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.A supplemental dose of 1–2 grams was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18% in children, on average (1).Other studies in adults have found 6–8 grams per day to be effective (2).Vitamin C appears to have even stronger effects in people who are under intense physical stress. In marathon runners and skiers, vitamin C alantost halved the duration of the common cold (1).Summary Although vitamin C supplements have no effect on the risk of catching a cold, they appear to reduce its severity and duration.How Does Vitamin C Reduce the Severity of Colds?Vitamin C is an antioxidant and necessary to produce collagen in the skin.Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, keeping skin and various tissues tough but flexible.A vitamin C deficiency results in a condition known as scurvy, which isn’t really a problem today, as most people get enough vitamin C from foods.However, it’s less known that vitamin C is also highly concentrated in immune cells and quickly depleted during an infection (3).In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens the immune system and increases the risk of infections (4).For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during an infection is a good idea.Summary Vitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells. It is depleted during infections, so a vitamin C deficiency may increase their risk.Other Nutrients and Foods That May HelpThere is no cure for the common cold.However, some foods and nutrients can help the body recover."

Although previous findings suggest that every 50 grams of processed meat a person eats daily increases his or her bowel cancer risk, the results of this study lowered the number of grams to 25 a day. “Our results strongly suggest that people who eat red and processed meat four or more times a week have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than those who eat red and processed meat less than twice a week,” said coauthor Tim Key, Cancer Research UK’s expert in diet and deputy director at the University of Oxford’s cancer epidemiology unit. According to Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, this doesn’t mean that people need to cut processed and red meat from their diets entirely. But she suggests that they reduce their intake of these meats. “You could try doing meat-free Mondays, looking for recipes using fresh chicken and fish or swapping meat for pulses like beans and lentils in your usual meals,” she said."

Evidence:"“The ACV diet claims drinking it before, during or after meals in varying quantities and dilutions will help you drop some weight, but there is little scientific evidence to support it,” said Reiland. “In studies where people did lose weight it was a few pounds and was also taken alongside a calorie-restricted diet. Therefore, these studies don’t tell us if ACV alone can help with weight loss.”
Are there other potential health benefits of apple cider vinegar? “ACV contains acetic acid, magnesium and probiotics. The probiotics in ACV are derived from  the fermentation process of sugar from apples, which is converted to alcohol and then to acetic acid, creating the ‘mother’ or floating particles in ACV,” said Reiland.

Evidence:"But does it actually work? Gastroenterologist Ali Rezaie says there’s some evidence that ginger mitigates nausea, especially in morning sickness. The caveat, he says, is that we still don’t really understand why nausea happens in the first place. It's likely that various mechanisms within the human body contribute to nausea, according to Rezaie, many of which we don’t quite understand yet. This makes it hard to pinpoint if and how ginger might help combat it.“You can't necessarily treat every single nausea with similar treatment,” he says. The nausea that he says ginger most effectively tamps down is mild to moderate morning sickness.However, when it comes to seasickness or motion sickness, Rezaie says over-the-counter or prescription medications will probably work better."

HSV-1 usually causes oral herpes, and HSV-2 usually causes genital herpes — each strain prefers to live on its favorite area. But it’s totally possible for both types of herpes simplex to infect either area. For example, you can get HSV-1 on your genitals if someone with a cold sore on their lips gives you oral sex. And you can get HSV-2 in your mouth if you give oral sex to someone with HSV-2 on their genitals."
