Evidence:"Results of both trials should be available later this year. Meanwhile Meltzer is leading three studies of vitamin D supplementation in populations with mixed ethnicity: one investigation in medically complex patients, a second in health care workers and a third that is community-based. They will assess the impact of various dosages of the vitamin on COVID-19 symptoms and antibodies, as well as on symptoms of other respiratory diseases. Given the results of Neale’s large-scale study and the modest benefits found in Martineau’s latest meta-analysis, it seems unlikely that vitamin D will prove to be a critical ingredient in fending off COVID-19 or modulating its severity. But these and other new trials may find it is useful in certain doses for certain populations. As Neale points out, “there is data that is suggestive” and enough smoke to indicate that you don’t want to be vitamin-D-deficient in a pandemic."

ABERDEEN: Vitamin C is a common remedy that some people believe will cure the common cold and flu.Although it helps us maintain good immune function, however, there’s little evidence that it can prevent or substantially reduce either of these diseases.Yet, in the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak, some “influencers” are claiming that taking mega-doses of vitamin C can cure COVID-19.So let’s cut to the chase. Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus?Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection.CAN VITAMIN C TREAT THE COMMON COLD?Using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up.Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health."

Evidence:"Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36. This observation motivates recent studies on the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Yet the evidence is not conclusive.Our results reconcile the existing different opinions towards the protection of BCG against COVID-19. We show that the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is strongest during the very early stage of the pandemic, while as the government begins to implement social distancing policy, and other actions, the effect of BCG vaccination gradually disappears in the later stages. Although the old vaccines may protect from the virus, the self-protection actions as well as compliance to social distancing policies are still the most protective measures in absence of an effective COVID-19 vaccine.Our study differs from previous studies in several aspects."

Evidence:"There are no health concerns about 5G and COVID-19, despite what conspiracy theorists have suggested. But the transmitter density required for 5G means that more people will be exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs), and at levels that emerging evidence suggests, are potentially harmful to health, argues Professor John William Frank, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh. The advent of 5G technology has been hailed by governments and certain vested interests as transformative, promising clear economic and lifestyle benefits, through massively boosting wireless and mobile connectivity at home, work, school and in the community, he says. But it has become the subject of fierce controversy, fuelled by four key areas of scientific uncertainty and concern. The lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; and a growing but far from comprehensive body of laboratory research indicating the biologically disruptive potential of RF-EMFs  
An almost total lack (as yet) of high quality epidemiological studies of the impact on human health from 5G EMF exposure
Mounting epidemiological evidence of such effects from previous generations of RF-EMF exposure at lower levels
Persistent allegations that some national telecomms regulatory authorities haven’t based their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, amid potential conflicts of interest
5G uses much higher frequency (3 to 300GHz) radio waves than in the past and it makes use of very new—and relatively unevaluated, in terms of safety—supportive technology to enable this higher data transmission capacity, points out Professor Frank. Its inherent fragility means that transmission boosting ‘cell’ antennae are generally required every 100–300 m—which is far more spatially dense than the transmission masts required for older 2G, 3G and 4G technology, using lower frequency waves, he says."

Transfusions of blood plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 may help patients hospitalized with the virus, a new international study shows. The treatment, known as convalescent plasma, is still considered experimental by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plasma contains antibodies, blood proteins that are part of the immune system. Shaped so they can attach to the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibodies glom onto and tag it for removal from the body, researchers say."

REUTERS/Emily ElconinJan 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine can be administered along with its pneumonia vaccine and produced strong safety and immune responses in people aged 65 and above in a late-stage study.The study, initiated in May, tested the company's next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PREVNAR 20, with a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shot in 570 participants.The aim of the study was to test the safety of the combination and the immune response after adding the pneumonia vaccine to the existing COVID-19 vaccine.The company said responses elicited by PREVNAR 20 and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were similar when given together or with placebo.The data provides evidence supporting the potential to administer PREVNAR 20 and the company's COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, reducing the number of visits people make to doctors or pharmacies for recommended immunization, Pfizer said.PREVNAR 20 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June last year to help protect adults against most invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia.Study participants were recruited from the companies' late-stage COVID-19 vaccine study, and those who had received the second dose of the company's COVID-19 vaccine at least six months before entering the co-administration study.Reporting by Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru;

Evidence:"Therefore, response to treatment in patients with COVID-19 might be affected by SexHs-related factors.Recently, the effect of SexH therapy has been investigated in COVID-19, and there are ongoing clinical trials to examine the impact of SexHs on COVID-19. Studies have investigated and discussed the possible therapeutic role of spironolactone, an anti-androgenic agent, in COVID-19 [57,58]. Estrogens and progesterone are other candidates against COVID-19 [37]. Considering the important role of SexHs, clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to sex differences in the dose and scheduling of COVID-19 vaccination [59].In summary, differences in the production of SexHs might lead to a disparity between females and males in terms of dealing with the infection. Note that sex-specific production of SexHs during different life stages might contribute to COVID-19 onset, progression, and even vaccine efficacy and drug response. The role of SexHs should be considered in the design of effective COVID-19 prevention strategies."

Evidence:"A research paper published at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic found that the cough suppressant, dextromethorphan, helps increase the rate of replication (multiplying) of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The authors of this research added that more research is needed to find out which medications are safe to take during the coronavirus infection.One important thing to consider is that this study was tested using cells in a lab and not on human beings. Based on this major factor, there is not enough evidence to conclude that dextromethorphan is not safe to take if someone is COVID-19 positive. So should you still avoid dextromethorphan with a coronavirus infection? It is completely up to you.

Evidence:"At day 6 after LPV/r therapy was initiated, 68.42% of patients were virologically cured, increasing to 84.22% at day 12.Conclusion In this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r within 12 days of the onset of symptoms, clinical improvement was observed in 18/19 patients (94.74%). Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to further evaluate this strategy.KEYWORDS:lopinavir–ritonavirSARS-CoV-2COVID-19IntroductionOne of the most promising drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lopinavir–ritonavir (LPV/r). But it is dispiriting that no benefit has been observed with LPV/r treatment in recent open-label randomised controlled trials in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19.1,2 However, in a posthoc subgroup analysis of the patients who were treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms, the mortality in standard-care group was numerically greater than the LPV/r group.1 It seems that early intervention with LPV/r may be of benefit in COVID-19. This hypothesis was also supported by a retrospective analysis which identified that COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir-combined regimen with a median length of time between the onset of symptoms and therapy initiation of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3–6).3 At present, the results regarding the efficacy of LPV/r treatment in COVID-19 show inconsistency between studies.4–7 Whether this is caused by the therapeutic window of LPV/r is still not well illustrated.In this retrospective observational study, we aim to present the effects of an early intervention with LPV/r on patients with severe COVID-19 in a single centre, providing additional evidence on the clinical use of LPV/r in COVID-19.MethodsStudy design and participantsThis retrospective study included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r and discharged or died from 27 January 2020 to 24 March 2020 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. The inclusion criteria of our study were patients aged 18–80 years with molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 infections who were classified as severe cases on admission and who received LPV/r treatment as least 3 days. Cases where the length of time between the onset of symptoms and initiating LPV/r therapy was >12 days, where LPV/r therapy was used in combination with other antiviral(s) after admission, or where there was insufficient information of the evaluation indexes were excluded from the study."

Evidence:"N. Srikanth, an Ayurvedic practitioner and a deputy director general at CCRAS, tells ScienceInsider that trials of Ayurvedic therapies for COVID-19 are underway. And on 9 October, an association of government Ayurvedic scientists said IMA's claim that Ayurvedic drugs were no better than placebos was "rigorously condemnable." They pointed out that some modern medical practitioners continue to use drugs such as hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, even though there is little evidence for their efficacy. (India's health ministry recommended hydroxychloroquine both as treatment and prevention for the pandemic coronavirus in March, based on a few small and inconclusive clinical trials, a decision it didn't roll back after subsequent larger studies failed to bear out their advice.) Any system of medicine, whether modern or alternative, must back up claims of efficacy with well-conducted trials, he says."

Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2
The following questions and answers provide a brief introduction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its use for environmental disinfection, often called UV germicidal irradiation or UVGI. UV has been used for disinfection in certain settings (e.g., healthcare environments, correctional facilities) and during the COVID-19 pandemic there has been interest in expanding its use to more settings and situations. We describe what we know about UV disinfection for SARS-CoV-2, potential uses for surface and air disinfection (e.g., upper room UVGI; in-duct or in-line UVGI), as well as limitations and potential harms.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Conclusions: Higher temperature and
higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, an increase in temperature by 1 degree Celsius is associated with
a reduction in the R value of COVID-19 by 0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in
China and by 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.; an increase in
relative humidity by 1% is associated with a reduction in the R value by 0.0076
(95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and by 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in
the U.S. Therefore, the potential impact of temperature/relative humidity on
the effective reproductive number alone is not strong enough to stop the
pandemic. Subjects:

Question:Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"“Our findings support the routine use of remdesivir in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19,” says study lead author Brian Garibaldi, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “We observed that remdesivir is best used as early as possible, before the patient progresses to requiring high levels of oxygen or intubation and mechanical ventilation. Most patients who need that kind of advanced respiratory support are likely past the point where antiviral therapies like remdesivir would be effective.”
There have been several previous studies on remdesivir’s effectiveness in treating COVID-19 infection, and the results have often conflicted. However, the authors of this study have great confidence in their conclusions due to the diversity of the patients evaluated and the fact that this is one of the largest retrospective studies of remdesivir to date. “This is an important, real-world study that shows remdesivir does work in many cases,” says Garibaldi. “Our findings are particularly important as we battle a surge of delta and omicron cases."

Evidence:"Criteria for this included a positive RT-PCR tests paired with mild to moderate associated symptoms such as fever and cough.Participants were randomised into two equal groups, one involving the administration of an oral CUR-QUE supplement with SOC, and one involving SOC alone. The CUR-QUE treatment group were required to take a soft capsule of 168mg of curcumin and 260mg of quercetin twice daily for 14 days. Both groups received SOC medications including paracetamol, oral azithromycin, oral prednisolone, with or without  ceftriaxone.At the seven day follow up, it was established that 45% more patients in the CUR-QUE group were clear of the COVID inflection, suggesting they were able to clear the virus significantly faster than the control group. It was established that by day 14, all remaining patients in both groups were clear of the virus, highlighting the delayed recovery time of those within this group.In addition, it was observed that the acute symptoms initially observed had cleared in 40% of the CUR-QUE treated group at day seven, when compared to 16% of the control group.With regards to the assessed laboratory biochemistry of the patients, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers were not observed to be significantly different between the two groups.Polyphenol potential​The study results suggest that the combined intakes of CUR-QUE may have therapeutic potential for treating the COVID-19 virus in patients at an early stage.“It is speculated that the observed treatment benefits of CUR-QUE supplementation is possibly due to synergistic pharmacological effects of curcumin and quercetin.”, ​the researchers explain, suggesting that the combination may interfere with the replication of the main protease (Mpro) involved the virus’ replication.They add that the polyphenols have also been observed to exhibit “direct binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) RBD”, ​which may prevent viral entry to host cells, the scientists hypothesise.Whilst the results mirror previous study findings, there is a need for future study utilising larger sample sizes, as well as placebo-controls and double-blind trials to further validate the observations.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health showed that participants who followed plant-based diets comprising of vegetables, legumes, and nuts, with lower amounts of red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and alcohol had 73% lower odds of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease severity. Compared to these individuals, participants who followed a low carbohydrate, high protein diet, had greater odds of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease severity. Types of plant-based diets
Plant-based diets are naturally low in calories and are nutrient dense. It requires cutting down on animal meat, not necessarily avoiding animal products entirely. It is also important to avoid processed foods like white bread, cakes, and sugary drinks. There are several types of plant-based diets to choose from depending on personal preferences."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Will the flu vaccine prevent COVID? The flu vaccine won’t prevent COVID, but it can lower your risk of getting severely ill from COVID by preventing severe flu illness. People can get both COVID and flu at the same time or one after the other, and these individuals are at more risk of severe illness. Does a flu vaccine increase your risk of getting COVID-19? There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccine increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19. You may have heard about a study published in January 2020 that reported an association between flu vaccination and the risk of four commonly circulating seasonal coronaviruses, but not the one that causes COVID-19."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A systematic review finds little evidence to back those fears.The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) does not appear to worsen the severity of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), according to new research.The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, also found that there is likely no connection between such medications and the chance of a symptomatic patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The results refute concerns by some that these medications might make patients more vulnerable amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Corresponding author Devan Kansagara, MD, MCR, of the Veterans Health Administration’s Portland Health Care System, explained in the study that early evidence from China showing hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with COVID-19, and that patients with those pre-existing conditions were experiencing more severe cases, led some experts to hypothesize that the 2 types of therapies might in some way be making people more susceptible to the disease.“The proposed mechanism by which ACEIs and ARBs may play a role in COVID-19 is through upregulation of the angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is presumed to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells,” Kansagara and colleagues wrote.Still, they noted that investigators have not yet been able to consistently demonstrate such an upregulation. Furthermore, others have hypothesized that the drugs might actually help patients fight off the virus.In an attempt to get to the bottom of the question, the investigators pulled together existing literature from medical databases, including ClinicalTrials.gov, that involved patients taking ACEIs or ARBs and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates or COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The study is being structured as a living systematic review, with plans to continue ongoing surveillance for a year.Though about half of the studies were small and did not adjust for confounding variables, Kansagara and colleagues found consistent outcomes in the research. Two retrospective studies showed use of the therapies was not connected with a higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and a third case-control study found no link between the drugs and COVID-19 illness.Beyond that, the investigators located 14 observational studies, with more than 23,000 enrollees, that consistently failed to show a link between disease severity and the 2 medications.The group also found 4 registered randomized trials that are designed not to gauge ACEIs and ARBs as potential exacerbating factors in COVID-19, but rather to test them as possible therapies for the disease.Altogether, the Kansagara and colleagues said they have high certaining that the drugs are not associated with more severe disease, and moderate certainty that the drugs aren’t associated with higher rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in symptomatic patients.“On the basis of the findings from this rapidly expanding literature, no indication exists to prophylactically stop ACEI or ARB treatment because of concerns about COVID-19,” investigators concluded."

Evidence:"14, 2020, 8:21 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 15, 2020, 1:45 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsA growing body of evidence suggests that blood type may play a role in the risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus or developing life-threatening complications from the illness.But it does not mean that any single blood type is more protective or more dangerous regarding Covid-19, and the evidence may indeed raise more questions than answers.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTwo studies on the topic were published Wednesday in the journal Blood Advances, a publication of the American Society of Hematology.In the first, researchers in Denmark looked back at data on 473,654 people tested for Covid-19 from February to July. Most results were negative; just 7,422 tests came back positive.Coronavirus survivors form online group to connect plasma donors, current patientsJune 25, 202001:47Blood type, the researchers found, stood out as a potential key difference between the two groups. "Blood group O is significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection," the study authors wrote, meaning that people with type O blood seemed to be less likely to become infected. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.The findings of the study are limited because blood type information was available for just 62 percent of those who were tested.It is also important to note that people with type O blood can and do become infected. "The study suggests if you have type O, you have a slightly lower risk," Dr. Roy Silverstein, chair of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, said. "But it's a small decrease," he said, adding that blood type does not equate to zero percent risk."
Question:Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19 The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"Your sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol. If not, it won’t kill germs effectively. Path to improved health
Proper handwashing not only reduces the spread of COVID-19, it can prevent the spread of other viral illnesses such as cold and flu. Handwashing requires five simple steps:
Wet: Put both your hands under clean, running water. Lather: Apply a generous amount of soap to the inside and back of your hands as well as your fingertips. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds (sing happy birthday) and don’t forget to wash under jewelry and fingernails."

Evidence:"You can do this – your child needs his or her lung health now more than ever. Is the rumor true, from the research out of France, that nicotine protects smokers from COVID-19 and could be used as a possible treatment option? No, it is not true. Smokers are considered at higher risk for a more severe illness for COVID-19. Unsupported claims have no place in public health. The article from France about smokers protected from COVID-19 has significant research limitations, including being a cross-sectional observational study, having a small sample size from one hospital, was not peer-reviewed, which is standard for any scientific research, and one of the authors in a similar opinion piece has a long history with tobacco funding.12 Tragically, this type of unfounded research and inflammatory headline puts people’s lives at risk."

By Dr. Liji Thomas, MDJul 31 2022Reviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 6.4 million deaths to date. A new Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research journal study discusses the utility of cannabidiol (CBD) in treating the inflammatory symptoms of COVID-19. This treatment approach could help arrest or reduce the progression of COVID-19, thereby potentially decreasing its severity and mortality rate.

Evidence:"All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ.Key findings For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group.Significance Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.Trial registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/."

Evidence:"Who Should Have Monoclonal Antibody Treatment? Currently, 2 monoclonal antibody products are being used to treat COVID-19 through a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization. Although researchers are still learning which patients with COVID-19 are most likely to benefit from monoclonal antibody therapy, early data suggest greater benefit in high-risk patients, including those older than 65 years, with a suppressed immune system, or with certain medical conditions including obesity. Monoclonal antibodies are intended for patients recently diagnosed as having COVID-19 who are not sick enough to be in the hospital but who have some risk factors for severe infection. Giving the infusion as early as possible in the course of infection is important, so patients should seek medical care and testing as soon as they develop symptoms.

Evidence:"Cleaning and disinfection
Regular cleaning plays a vital role in limiting the transmission of COVID-19. Reducing clutter and removing difficult to clean items can make cleaning easier. Increase the frequency of cleaning, using standard cleaning products such as detergents and bleach, paying attention to all surfaces but especially ones that are touched frequently, such as door handles, light switches, work surfaces, remote controls and electronic devices. As a minimum, frequently touched surfaces should be wiped down twice a day, and one of these should be at the beginning or the end of the working day. Cleaning should be more frequent depending on the number of people using the space, whether they are entering and exiting the setting and access to handwashing and hand-sanitising facilities. Cleaning of frequently touched surfaces is particularly important in bathrooms and communal kitchens."

Evidence:"Over 20 hospitals will participate in the study, which is anticipated to last 3-4 months. The announcement came about a week after the company reported that treatment with remestemcel-L in a group of 12 COVID-19 patients with ARDS at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York had a survival rate of 83%. The purpose of the randomized, controlled clinical trial is to test that survival rate on a larger scale. “We were very pleased with preliminary data demonstrating the cells seem to have benefitted some of these patients,” says CEO Silviu Itescu. “If the cells work in COVID-19 ARDS, we’re in a position to provide products to as many patients as possible.” 
For coronavirus patients, ARDS is one of the deadliest complications of the disease, and often ends up requiring the use of ventilators in order to ensure they’re getting sufficient oxygen."

The pathogens mosquitoes spread by sucking our blood cause over half a million deaths each year and hundreds of millions of cases of severe illness. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest mosquitoes are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the coronavirus but based on current understandings, it’s highly unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus by biting an infected person, let alone be able to pass it on.

Evidence:"The new study gives community and hospital pharmacies the green light to make their own sanitizers quickly and easily using the WHO formulations, confident that they will be effective.The authors conclude:However, the team cautions, their findings rely on the assumption that the sanitizer is in contact with the virus for at least 30 seconds.This may not always be the case in practice. In its advice to the public on hand hygiene, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that sanitizing the hands with gel should take about 20 seconds.Active ingredientsThe scientists also tested ethanol and isopropanol — the active ingredients of each WHO-recommended formulation — in isolation and in varying concentrations. Their results suggest that either ethanol or isopropanol at a concentration of at least 30% vol/vol is sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.For comparison, the CDC recommend that hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers sold in pharmacies and shops typically have an alcohol concentration of around 60%.Homemade hand sanitizers made without the necessary skills, equipment, and medical-grade ingredients, however, may not contain alcohol concentrations high enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For example, pure rubbing alcohol, or “surgical spirit” in the United Kingdom, and vodka have alcohol concentrations of around 70% and 40%, respectively.But repeated use of rubbing alcohol on the hands can dehydrate the skin, causing inflammation and irritation. And vodka is unsuitable for making hand sanitizer, according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, because it is not the right grade of alcohol.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland — Fact checked by Hannah Flynn —  Updated on Jul 3, 2020Latest newsCould a drug for high blood pressure help slow aging?"

The post, which also claims “Coronavirus mutates and multiplies in the body through acid cells”, has over 34 shares on Facebook as of March 6, 2020. An example can be seen here .Reuters could not find any evidence that suggests the consumption of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or lemon help prevent COVID-19 infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there is no specific cure yet for the new coronavirus. “There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 and treatment is based on clinical presentation. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, and treated symptomatically”, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters.The full claim reads:“Due to the rising issue of coronavirus it’s been found that coronavirus mutates & multiplies in the body through acid cells, in simple form, if you have too much acid cells in your body you are more likely to be infected by coronavirus & if you have less acid cells you stand less chance of being infected, & we know that bicarbonate of soda reduces acid cells in the body, so in order to clear yourself of acid cells, drink a small amount of the mixture of water & bicarbonate of soda, just take 1 or even half spoon of it & pour it into your water dispenser or drinking bottle just to keep your acid cells at a minimum level."
