Evidence:"If bleeding still has not stopped, place a teabag in lukewarm water, squeeze out excess water and wrap it in gauze. Bite down on the wet teabag for up to 30 minutes. The tannic acid in the tea bag should help to stop the bleeding. Do not disturb the wound
Doing so may cause discomfort, infection and bleeding. Do not suck on a straw, smoke, blow your nose, rinse your mouth vigorously, or spit forcibly for 48 hours. Any of these activities may dislodge the important first blood clot and interrupt the normal healing process."

Evidence:"Crystal healing benefits
Crystal healing is a complementary and natural approach, meaning it can be used alongside traditional medicine and has no negative side effects. The benefits of crystal healing are varied and take place on several different levels. Perhaps the most common benefit reported is the deep relaxation that takes place during a session. This type of relaxation helps aid general well-being and is particularly useful when treating stress and anxiety. It can also help ease tense muscles which can help improve physical pain and sleeping problems. On an emotional and spiritual level, crystals can help enhance self-esteem, encourage clarity and inspire a sense of peace and centredness."

Evidence:"Experts say this is simply because a number of large studies have found no real evidence of such a link. “I think that we can make a policy or public health decision that cell phones don’t cause cancer based on the summary of the evidence,” said Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Timothy Rebbeck in an October 20, 2022 MedPage Today article. Rebbeck, Vincent L. Gregory, Jr. Professor of Cancer Prevention and director of the Zhu Family Center for Global Cancer Prevention, acknowledged that there are limitations with large human studies, but said that experts view the issue regarding cell phones and brain cancer as largely settled. “My take on it is, when you get to a certain level of human data … the risk that might be conferred by cell phone use is so small,” he said."

Evidence:"Nearly anyone who has used the familiar spray knows about its ability to lubricate everything from hinges to locks, or how it removes stains and cleans car engines and rifle parts. This year, WD-40 is marking its 40th birthday by asking consumers to write about some of the uses that are not advertised. They include luring fish and soothing arthritic joints, according to Jerry Schleif, president of the WD-40 Co., which has its headquarters here. "We get a half-dozen letters a month claiming it helps arthritis," said Schleif. "There's no medical reason it should, but people swear by it." Those who fish in Washington state and Alaska use WD-40 as a fish lure and have been spraying it on live bait to catch steelhead salmon for years."

Evidence:"Back to top
How are cancer genes inherited? Genetic conditions can be passed through a family in several ways. We have two copies of every gene because we inherit one copy from our mother and one copy from our father. In turn, one copy of each gene is passed on to a child. For some mutations, called autosomal dominant, inheriting one copy of a mutated gene is enough to increase the risk of developing cancer. When a person has an autosomal dominant mutation, there is a 50% chance that the mutation was inherited from their mother and a 50% chance that the mutation was inherited from their father."

Evidence:"The prediction would be that by reawakening these cells, you could make the tumor far more sensitive to therapy.”
	Baking soda had previously been reported to enhance cancer immunotherapy by one of the coauthors of the new study, Robert Gillies, Ph.D., of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, though the mechanism underlying the effect was unclear. In the current study, the Ludwig scientists emphasized the importance of the peripheral scattering of lysosomes in acidic conditions, an effect that has been observed in other studies, though not in the context of mTORC1 activation, which appears to be governed by the spatial positioning, or repositioning, of the mTORC1 signaling elements. These mechanistic details are relevant to the study of cancer because researchers have long known that quiescent cells cannot typically be killed by chemotherapy. Notably, Dang and his team also found that T-cell activation, which is essential to most immunotherapies, is similarly compromised under acidic conditions. “We started out with a question about oxygen starvation and the circadian clock, and we ended up discovering a new mechanism by which acidic conditions in tissues shut off a lot of things—including the cell’s molecular clock,” muses Dang. The finding that something as simple as baking soda could possibly help reverse this effect and render quiescent cancer cells susceptible to cancer therapies excites Dang."

Evidence:"Fruit juices can still be loaded with many important micronutrients, especially vitamins and minerals, that are not broken down during the process of juicing, and this is especially true when blended from whole fruits. However, though fresh fruit juices with no added sugar are certainly recommendable in comparison to sugary drinks like sodas and packaged and processed fruit beverages with added sugar or made from concentrate, the main conclusions to take away from this post are that fruit juices overall have less fiber and a significantly higher glycemic load than the whole fruits they are derived from, and are often consumed in addition to solid foods, not in substitution. Therefore, their frequent consumption can potentially increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. For diabetics and those at high risk for developing diabetes, as well as individuals looking to maintain overall health, eating whole fresh fruits, and drinking healthful beverages like water and unsweetened coffee and tea, are the best options for regulating blood glucose levels and maintaining a healthy weight.Resources and Further Reading2013 study revealing many aspects of why fruit juices increase risk of developing diabetes as opposed to whole fruits: http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001A study about sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juices and sodas and incidence of type 2 diabetes: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/3/517.longA guide that gives some solid recommendations on diabetes prevention, including limiting fruit juice intake and explanations about glycemic index and load: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#referencesGlycemic and Glycemic Load guide from Harvard: https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foodsSugar-sweetened beverages such as packaged and processed fruit juice, and diabetes incidence in African American women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663160?dopt=Citation

Evidence:"And, of course, working on muscles is totally pointless for our purposes.What cellulite massage can offer and what it can’tMany types of massage can indeed boost circulation and lymphatic drainage and consequently partially help PREVENT low-grade inflammation, fibrosis and some fat accumulation too.A real cellulite massage can additionally REDUCE fibrosis, low-grade chronic inflammation and to some extent also help boost skin firmness.But no cellulite massage can really reduce cellulite fat.So massage has its limitations, especially in relation to technology-based treatments, such as deep-acting, high-power radiofrequency/ultrasound cavitation.But for those who do not have access to such treatments, who do no want to pay the higher cost or who simply do not like technology-based treatments, a good cellulite massage can play an important role in cellulite prevention and reduction.Deep tissue massage for celluliteAnd since we mentioned working on muscles and deep fascia, let’s talk about deep tissue massage first. Deep tissue massage, also known as remedial massage or sports massage, works on muscles and deep fascia. These are the tissues where all the techniques used for deep tissue massage aim to affect, in order to restore balance on the musculoskeletal system.Because deep tissue massage is supposed to be a stronger type of massage, as opposed to the swedish/relaxation variety, people think that it can help cellulite too - at least more than swedish massage.Even though by working with a lot of pressure on muscles does somewhat affect the hypodermis, it still is not specific enough to offer any good results with cellulite, so deep tissue massage is not an effective cellulite technique.Great for the muscles and overall circulation/lymphatic drainage, not that amazing for cellulite.Swedish massage for celluliteSwedish massage is just too light to have even any half-decent effect on cellulite.Swedish massage is:great for mental relaxation for some people (and highly irritating for people who like deeper massage)kinda helpful for muscular relaxationdecently helpful for circulation improvementbut really pointless for cellulite.Clearly a much more vigorous and specific treatment is needed.Thai massage for celluliteThai massage is based on point pressures and stretching.The point pressures are just too “pointy” to affect the entire cellulite surface. Also they are not specific to the hypodermis either.The stretches are nice for the muscles but wouldn’t do anything for cellulite.And both point pressures and stretches would boost circulation to a small extent, but not to a large extent, and neither in any specific way to affect cellulite.So, all in all, Thai massage may be an overall nice type of bodywork/massage for mental and muscular relaxation, but not for cellulite removal. (MLD) Manual lymphatic drainage massage for celluliteLymphatic drainage massage is the elephant in the room when it comes to cellulite massages. Mention cellulite massage and everyone thinks ‘lymphatic massage’.But is all the hype justified?Three-four decades ago in continental Europe, and twenty years ago here in the UK, the only game in town when it came to cellulite massage was lymphatic massage:partly because that’s people believed that “cellulite is all toxins and water retention, you know”partly due to the unjustified cure-all, legend status manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) has attained among manual therapistsAnd partly because to some extent it does help cellulite - the keyphrase here being “to some extent”Manual lymph massage does help boost circulation and lymphatic drainage in people with lymphoedema (clinical water retention) better than any other technique, simply because these people need that special type of massage.But for the vast majority of the population who do not have clinical problems with water retention, the circulation boosting / lymphatic drainage that MLD offers can also be offered equally effectively even with the most rudimentary massage, including swedish and deep tissue.It can also be achieved with mechanical massage, such as pressotherapy."

This is not the case. Any mood-altering substance has the potential to become addictive, and marijuana is no exception. Estimates of marijuana addiction vary, depending on how each research team defines addiction, which people they survey, and similar factors. A 2011 study found that in the United States between 2001 and 2005, the overall probability of addiction among people who used marijuana was 8.9%, suggesting that 1 in 11 people who use the drug may become addicted.

Beyond Carrots: 5 Foods for Healthy Eyes
								  	Contributions made by								    								        								        Adam C. Martin, OD
To keep eyes healthy, include these foods in your diet. You likely grew up hearing that you should eat your carrots because they’re good for your eyes. It is true that carrots, as well as other orange-colored fruits and vegetables, can improve eye health thanks to the beta-carotene they contain. But they’re not the only foods you should eat to keep your eyes healthy. Other nutrients in addition to beta-carotene, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, zinc, vitamins C and E and omega-3 fatty acids, help protect your eyes, especially as you age. They have been shown to slow the progression of macular degeneration, which can cause vision loss, and may help prevent cataracts."

Evidence:"3. Alcohol preparation methods cause high methanol content leading to poisoning
 Using materials with wood residue (cellulose): Normally, ethanol is distilled from rice or cane sugar, so it is not toxic. However, some distilleries use molasses that is not clean of residues (cellulose contains cellulose in bagasse), leading to the phenomenon that during distillation fermentation, the residue decomposes to produce methanol. If using bagasse or using molasses with residue to make alcohol, the methanol content in the alcohol will be high, easy to cause acute alcohol poisoning; Production of alcohol from poor quality ethyl alcohol: A large amount of alcohol on the market is prepared by mixing alcohol with water. On average, 1 liter of alcohol can make 3 liters of alcohol without the effort or cost of making wine by distillation. More dangerously, many owners of alcohol production facilities use poor quality alcohol (cheap, high content of methanol, aldehyde, acetone) so when making alcohol, there will be high content of methanol, aldehyde, acetone."

Evidence:"Here are 5 effective exercises for lowering cholesterol
When it comes to lowering cholesterol, there is no single exercise that works. Reducing cholesterol levels requires a combination of diet, exercise, lifestyle modifications, and medication if necessary. However, regular exercise can help promote good health overall, especially if you incorporate aerobic exercises and resistance training. The American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every day for good heart health. With a balanced diet and daily exercise of 30 minutes about 6 days a week, it could take 8 weeks to a year to see results, depending on your current body weight."

Evidence:"“So, if you can’t apply something to the skin inside the [eye’s] bony rim because it’s going to end up harming the surface of the eye, then sunglasses can afford you that protection.”Reduce Cataract RiskReducing Your Odds of CataractsThe clouding of the lens part of our eye that leads to reversible vision loss is a cataract. And while we tend to associate cataracts with age, spending a lot of time in the sun is also a risk factor. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, about 10% of cataract cases can be attributed to UV exposure. It’s thought that the eye’s lens absorbs UV light. A 2014 study published in Journal of Biological Chemistry found that UV light harms lens proteins, causing damaging oxidative reactions, possibly leading to cataract formation. “Wearing sunglasses to prevent premature cataract formation is a good idea,” says Jessica S. Watson, M.D., an ophthalmologist and retina specialist at Northern Light Retina Care, affiliated with Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, ME."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The researchers did not find an association between statins and mental problems. However, they admitted that none of the major randomized trials with statins that they had reviewed systematically looked for cognitive decline and that the symptom could have been subtle. Therefore, the researchers concluded that no definitive statement about statins and memory problems could be made one way or the other. Another major review of research published in 2021 looked at 24 studies that included 1,404,459 people to see if statin use was linked to cognitive impairment. The researchers concluded that "there was no evidence of adverse cognitive effects, including [the] incidence of dementia, deterioration in global cognition, or specific cognitive domains associated with statin use in individuals aged ≥60 years," but that "studies should examine this association in studies with longer follow-up periods."

Evidence:""This can result in fluctuating levels of a medication in the body. "So how does grapefruit affect medications?More than half of all medications are metabolized in your small intestine by an enzyme commonly known as CYP3A4. However, just a single glass of grapefruit juice can block this enzyme and interfere with your body's process of breaking down the medication. "This causes medication levels to remain higher and longer than without grapefruit," Joy Peterson, a clinical pharmacist at Wellstar Health System, tells Yahoo Life. "The increased levels may cause patients to experience side effects. "For example, when the blood pressure drug felodipine is taken with grapefruit juice rather than water, levels of the medication in the blood can more than double and result in headache, irregular heartbeat, swelling, and fluid retention."

Evidence:"(iStockPhoto)Help keep family & friends informed by sharing this articleabc.net.au/news/cold-sores-and-genital-herpes/7537050Copy linkShareAsk anyone who gets cold sores and they'll tell you how unpleasant these little sores and blisters can be.Key points:The same virus that causes cold sores can also cause genital herpes and it can happen even if there are no symptomsPreviously HSV type 1 was common near the mouth and HSV type 2 mostly affected the genitalsBut HSV type 1 is now also common near the genitalsCold sores, which usually appear on your lips or the skin around your mouth, are also known as oral herpes and are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). This virus is also responsible for blisters and sores in the genital area, known as genital herpes.So if you have cold sores, is it possible to give your partner genital herpes?Unfortunately, the short answer is yes, according to sexual health physician Terri Foran.To understand why — the first thing you need to know is that there are two types of HSV. In the past, HSV type 1 (HSV-1) was most commonly seen on the lips (usually as cold sores), while HSV type 2 (HSV-2) preferred the genital area.However, in recent years doctors have seen more cases of genital herpes caused by HSV-1. If you have oral HSV-1 and your partner doesn't, you can spread it through any type of sexual contact where the mouth comes into contact with their mouth or their genitals — and sometimes the buttocks and legs as well. This explains why some people have the same type of herpes on both their lips and their genitals.More alarmingly, Dr Foran said you don't even need to have any outward sign of cold sores to spread the virus. Perfectly normal looking skin can still shed lots of viral particles — sometimes even more than when the blisters are actually present.Who gets herpes?Lots of people have cold sores, and lots of people have oral sex — so why don't more of us get genital herpes?The reason is because during childhood, most of us (perhaps 80 per cent) are exposed to type 1 of the herpes virus, Dr Foran said."
