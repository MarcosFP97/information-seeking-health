Evidence:"Half the participants were offered a vitamin D blood test and, of this group, 86% had suboptimal vitamin D levels and received either 800 IU/d or 3200 IU/d of vitamin D supplements for 6 months. The other half of participants did not receive testing or supplements. Neither of the vitamin D doses showed an effect on all-cause acute respiratory tract infections or COVID-19 cases specifically compared with the control group. At least 1 acute respiratory tract infection occurred in 5.7% of the lower-dose group, 5% of the higher-dose group, and 4.6% of the control group. Of 178 participants who developed COVID-19, 3.6% were in the lower-dose vitamin D group, 3% were in the higher-dose group, and 2.6% were in the control group. There were no differences in COVID-19 severity or prolonged symptoms between the 3 groups."

Evidence:"Currently, no evidence supports the use of vitamin C or D in treating COVID-19.Summary  Currently, research suggests that vitamin C may help reduce the severity of complications related to COVID-19, but it may not treat or prevent the condition itself.COVID-19 is a new disease. Research continually changes as researchers enroll more participants in more studies. As the pandemic progresses, so will medical knowledge about how to treat and prevent it and whether or not any specific home remedies are effective. Without more information, it is impossible to know for sure which treatments might work and which might make it worse.

Evidence:"Originating from China, green tea is lauded for many health benefits due to its potential antioxidant, antiviral and immune-boosting properties (1, 2).It’s recently been investigated for a possible role in managing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes illness from COVID-19. You may have heard that drinking green tea prevents or cures the disease.In this article, we explain whether green tea affects COVID-19 and offer some immune-boosting tips.Share on PinterestDylan Leeder/Stocksy UnitedDoes green tea prevent or cure COVID-19?Green tea is rich in health-promoting polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has anti-viral effects against single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like Zika, hepatitis C, influenza (flu), dengue, and others (1, 3, 4, 5).Like these, the SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA virus. Thus, green tea extracts continue to be investigated for their potential role in treating the virus and managing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2).Test-tube research shows that green tea extracts may combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus by damaging the spike protein, preventing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall volume of the virus (3, 4, 5, 6).Treatment of the test tube cells with EGCG was most effective during early stages of infection (3).However, it’s important to understand that drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. Most studies showing an effect used single green tea extracts like EGCG in concentrated amounts much higher than what’s found in the natural tea.Furthermore, EGCG is poorly absorbed when consumed orally from teas (4).Nonetheless, green tea extracts may have potential to be used for natural treatment of COVID-19 after further human research and testing.Remember, the best way to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated, maintaining physical distancing, and washing your hands often. You can learn more about COVID-19 vaccines here.SummaryDrinking green tea cannot prevent, treat, or cure the COVID-19 virus, but concentrated extracts like EGCG may have potential to be used for natural treatment after further human research and testing.Are there benefits to drinking green tea if you have COVID-19?A COVID-19 infection can cause inflammation, which is linked to symptoms like fatigue, muscle pain, and achy joints (7).Green tea may have anti-inflammatory properties. It’s shown to reduce damaging inflammation associated with the COVID-19 virus, potentially easing these symptoms (8)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The strong recommendation for patients with non-severe illness reflects the panel’s view that drug treatment in patients with a low risk of mortality and other important clinical outcomes is not justified. And although convalescent plasma should not be used routinely in any patients, regardless of how severely ill they are, the panel acknowledged that there was sufficient uncertainty in patients with severe and critical illness to warrant continuation of RCTs. They also noted several practical challenges, such as the need to identify and test potential donors, as well as collect, store and administer donor plasma, which they say further limits its feasibility and applicability. After thoroughly reviewing all the information, the panel judged that almost all well informed patients would choose not to receive convalescent plasma. Today’s guidance adds to previous recommendations for the use of interleukin-6 receptor blockers and systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe or critical covid-19; conditional recommendations for the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies in selected patients and against the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 regardless of disease severity.

Evidence:"Other research suggested that adherence to preventive practices such as use of face masks in public spaces, social distancing, and physical isolation can reduce transmission of COVID-19, flatten the curve of new cases, and save lives [7]. Empirical findings also showed that social distancing was an effective tool in reducing the number of COVID-19 infections in China [16]. Moreover, from a study of 11 European countries, Flaxman et al. [13] estimated that social distancing measures may have prevented as many as 59, 000 COVID-19 deaths through March 31, 2020. A study that evaluated the impact of social distancing measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the U.S. showed that adoption of government-imposed social distancing policies reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases [17]. One aspect of social distancing that emerges from the literature to play a role in reducing the spread of COVID-19 is its impact on travel."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"These therapies got an additional boost when the World Health Organization greenlit trials for alternative COVID-19 therapies last September. India answered the call with more than 100 different studies examining the efficacy of various traditional medicines, including everything from therapeutic yoga positions to Kadha, a type of herbal tea consumed to fight coughs and colds.But Rajan Sharma, an orthopedic surgeon and former president of the Indian Medical Association, says the studies lack credibility because of very small sample sizes. The pilot study on AYUSH 64, for example, was led by mostly government researchers and included only 140 people. The researchers concluded the herbal pill could treat COVID-19 because another study in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine found it effective for influenza-like respiratory illnesses. Even Ayurveda experts are now calling this into question.A letter in the same journal noted the AYUSH 64/influenza trial studied a mix of modern and Ayurvedic medicines, making the claims of efficacy against flu-like illness “scientifically untenable since it is not possible to identify the drug that actually cured or brought relief to patients.”Doctors have warned that unscientific practices, like smearing cow dung on one’s body, could be dangerous, leading to other infections, such as mucormycosis, known as black fungus.

Evidence:"Though there hasn’t been any research looking at how UVC affects Covid-19 specifically, studies have shown that it can be used against other coronaviruses, such as Sars. The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves. However, it's not quite as good as we might have hoped. In a recent study – which looked at whether UVC could be used to disinfect PPE – the authors found that, while it is possible to kill the virus this way, in one experiment it needed the highest exposure out of hundreds of viruses that have been looked at so far. The amount of ultraviolet required varied widely, depending on factors such as the shape and type of material the virus was on.

Bottom Line
Some of the variations in COVID-19 transmission between cities worldwide can be explained by higher temperature and humidity being associated with lower transmission rates. Evidence Summary
69,498 cases in China and 740,843 in the USA were included in the analysis. A 1°C increase in temperature was associated with a reduction in R of 0.023 (95% CI [-0.0395 to -0.0125) in China and 0.020 (95% CI -0.0311 to -0.0096) in the US. A 1% relative humidity rise was associated with a reduction in RE by 0.0078 (95% CI -0.011 to -0.0045) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI -0.015 to -0.0010) in the US. After the lockdowns in China and the US, temperature and relative humidity were still associated with changes in transmission but appeared to have a lower impact. A one thousand people per square kilometre rise in population density was associated with a 0.12 (95% CI [0.057, 0.18]) increase in the R-value before lockdown."

Evidence:""It's a very large study and it has a very robust endpoint." Martin Landray of the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the world's largest study of various COVID-19 treatments, says remdesivir "definitely doesn't work in the sickest patients where the biggest gains would be" but might help people at earlier stages of disease. Further complicating the matter, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 recover without any intervention. "The argument that the earlier you use it the better is great until you realize what the implications of that are: You won't save many lives, and you'll have to treat a lot of patients," Landray says. "It's very inconvenient, and it'll cost you a fortune." Questions have also arisen about the potential of remdesivir to do harm."

Evidence:"In case of an acute infection, the inflammatory reaction can even damage body’s own healthy tissues and organs — a condition known as cytokine storm. Ajaikumar Kunnumakkara, professor at the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, evaluated the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. The search showed numerous cases that have reported the potency of spices, including turmeric, to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation. They are cheap and relatively safe to consume and their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, he reports in Life Sciences published on January 30, 2021. The reason curcumin, and by association turmeric, has not been used as an allopathic drug is because the substance’s poor bioavailability (duration of its presence in the blood). Kunnumakkara feels that the issue of bioavailability can be easily remedied by using a combination of methods."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"One study showed that a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a 9% lower risk of COVID-19 infection and a 41% lower risk of severe COVID-19. Another study found that health care workers following a plant-based diet who had substantial exposure to COVID-19 patients had a 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Okinawa, Japan, one of the “Blue Zones” where people live long and healthy lives, is another real-world example the authors provide to show the benefits of a plant-based diet for COVID-19. Okinawa, where the diet is predominantly plant-based and rich in sweet potatoes, green leafy vegetables, and soy products, has a much lower COVID-19 mortality rate than Tokyo, which is similar in size but has a lower population density.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Well, yes. SARS-CoV-2 is not the only coronavirus in town; coronaviruses have given us SARS and MERS in the past, and a handful of them are responsible for many cases of what we call the common cold. So in this analysis, getting immunized against the flu seemingly put you at an increased risk of getting a mild cold caused by a coronavirus. Some wondered if this meant that being immunized against the flu during the COVID-19 pandemic would be a weakness, not a boon. There was a big problem with this association, though: it wasn’t real. A Canadian team showed that Wolff had made a mistake."

Evidence:"No studies were found that were designed to directly assess whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19. After adjustment for confounders, history of ACE inhibitor or ARB use was not found to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19 illness. There were no studies that address the potential benefits and harms of initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs as treatment for patients with COVID-19. ConclusionThere is low-certainty evidence that patients on long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not at higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. Preventing a covid-19 pandemic."

Evidence:"Women’s sexual arousal is also significantly negatively impacted by smoking. What’s more, we know that the benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh any theoretical protective effects of starting or continuing to smoke against coronavirus infection. Among them: improved immunity, lowered cancer risk, improved circulation and blood pressure, clearer skin, lower cholesterol, and better control over blood sugar and insulin. Simply put, even if there is a curious crop of data suggesting smokers aren’t being admitted to hospitals, seeking treatment, or testing positive for COVID-19 as frequently as non-smokers, these findings by no means confirm that smoking protects against coronavirus infection, nor should they be considered as a means to justify continued smoking or take it up. The data could be erroneous (false positives are a hallmark of new research, which is why replication is required before scientists conclude that their hypotheses are correct). And the consequences of continuing to or starting to smoke are far, far graver than reducing or eliminating cigarette consumption."

Evidence:"A comprehensive review of studies published in Seminars in Vascular Surgery in September 2021 examined peer-reviewed journal articles published from March 2020 to January 2021. Researchers found inconsistent findings but did identify certain trends suggesting that blood type A might predispose one to increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), or that type O and Rh-negative blood groups might be protective. Still, the study authors wrote, "the impact of blood type on clinical outcomes remains unclear. At this point in time, there does not appear to be any relationship between blood type and COVID-19–related severity of illness or mortality." The Role of Blood Type and Virus Risk  
While the link between blood type and COVID-19 risk is still unclear, it's important to note that there have been links between blood type and diseases in the past. Blood type has been identified as a risk factor in many diseases, from cancer to venous and arterial thromboembolism."

Evidence:"Only one study [40] involving 20 index patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 in Beijing and 79 of their household contacts investigated a specific frequency of hand washing and showed that hand washing at least 5 times per day was associated with reduced risk of transmission (52.8% vs.76.9%; p = 0.04).One study [33], conducted amongst 348 hospitalised COVID-19 cases and 348 patients hospitalised for other reasons in Al-Nasiriya city in Iraq, investigated “healthy hand washing”; however, provided no details on what this involved. Nevertheless, “healthy hand washing” was significantly associated with lower risk of infection (p < 0.001).Two studies [37, 39] focused on both, the duration of hand washing (for at least 20 seconds) and hand washing or ABHR use at specific times, including after contact with high-risk [39] or symptomatic [37] individuals, washing hands when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, before or after handling food, after using toilet, after outdoor activity, before or after attending to a child or sick person, after sneezing or coughing, after handling pets and before touching the mouth or nose area [37]. The studies were conducted in Ohio and Florida, with the involvement of 113 COVID-19 cases and 226 controls [39] and in Macao, China amongst 24 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and 1113 control participants who completed quarantine after travelling from a COVID-19 high-risk foreign country [37].Lio et al. [37] reported that washing hands after outdoor activity (aOR: 0.021; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.134; p < 0.005) and before touching the mouth and nose area (aOR: 0.303; 95% CI: 0.114, 0.808; p < 0.05) were found to be independent protective factors against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Interestingly, Lio et al. [37], also found that compared to control participants, infected individuals were significantly less likely to report washing hands after contact with someone who had respiratory symptoms (50% vs. 95.3%; p = 0.005), but not after contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% vs. 95.2%; p = 0.057), while Speaker et al."

Evidence:"Of the smokers prescribed NRT, 4.5% died, a significantly lower rate of mortality compared to 7.7% observed in smokers who did not receive NRT. “Several hypotheses have been forwarded regarding a possible mitigating effect of nicotine on COVID-19 outcomes,” said lead author Dr. Thomas Piasecki of the University of Wisconsin. “Nicotine may activate various anti-inflammatory mechanisms that might help protect against progression to severe disease. But it is critically important to note that the current, observational findings cannot establish a causal effect of this medication. It could also be that patients with less severe acute illness were more likely to receive medication to quit smoking. Randomized clinical trials are needed to rigorously determine whether nicotine reduces COVID-19 mortality."

Evidence:""But overall, it's very unlikely, in my view right now sitting here, that anything's going to change," he says. Another hope for hydroxychloroquine, that it might prevent people exposed to the virus from getting sick, also faded last week when David Boulware of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and colleagues published the results of the largest study to date of this strategy, called postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The researchers sent either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo by mail to 821 people who had been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient for more than 10 minutes without proper protection. They reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that 12% of the people who took the drug went on to develop COVID-19 symptoms, versus 14% in a placebo group, a difference that was not statistically significant. A second large PEP trial has come up empty as well, its leader tells Science. Carried out in Barcelona, Spain, that study randomized more than 2300 people exposed to the virus to either hydroxychloroquine or the usual care."

Evidence:"COVID-19 antibodies have been found in breast milk
Mounting evidence shows that breast milk of vaccinated mothers carries antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. One recent study of 84 women detected strong production of IgA and IgG antibodies in breast milk for six weeks after vaccination. The overwhelming majority—97%—had elevated breast milk antibodies. The researchers also observed neutralizing effects in the immune proteins, potentially signaling that they keep infants safe from COVID-19. "This means that mothers are not only producing antibodies within their bodies at high levels for protection against the virus that causes COVID-19, but also, they produce high enough levels that the antibodies are secreted via their breast milk," Dr. Soni says. This discovery is an exciting first step toward protecting infants, she says."

Evidence:"Hence, it is crucial to identify adjuvant and protective therapies that improve kidney function in patients with severe COVID-19. The present study found that the administration of omega-3 PUFAs significantly decreased BUN, Cr, and K and increased urine volume in ICU patients infected with COVID-19. These findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation may be protective against progression to renal impairment, consistent with observations from animal models that showed that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduces the progression of renal disease [27,28,29,30,31]. Moreover, studies in human subjects suggested that a higher dietary intake of PUFAs may improve creatinine clearance [32] and also may have a role in maintaining healthy kidney function [33].

Currently, according to ClinicalTrials.gov there are 37 studies of IVIG in patients with CO­VID-19, of which 23 are in the recruitment phase.The use of IVIG has not been found to be beneficial in hospitalized patients with influenza A or B infection [7]. This should not discourage further research in the field of viral pneumonias and COVID-19 in particular. In a retrospective study of 58 cases with severe or critical illness due to COVID-19, early administration of IVIG was associated with reduced ventilator use, reduced hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and improved 28-day mortality [8]. Given the immunomodulatory effect of IVIG, it is important to properly select patients for this kind of treatment.

NEW YORK, Oct.  29, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq:MESO; ASX:MSB), global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, today provided an update on the potential pathway to marketing approval for its lead product candidate remestemcel-L. It also provided a financial report for the first quarter ended September 30, 2020. Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr Silviu Itescu stated: “We believe the immunomodulatory properties of remestemcel-L position this potential therapy at the forefront of treatment for severe and life-threatening inflammatory conditions, including COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD). We are pursuing an accelerated approval pathway for remestemcel-L in the treatment of children with SR-aGVHD, and a parallel approval pathway for COVID-19 ARDS if the randomized controlled Phase 3 trial is positive.” Children with Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host DiseaseIn August, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC)1 of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 9:1 that the available data from a single-arm Phase 3 trial and evidence from additional studies support the efficacy of remestemcel-L in pediatric patients with SR-aGVHD. Despite the overwhelming ODAC vote, in September the FDA recommended that Mesoblast conduct at least one additional randomized, controlled study in adults and/or children to provide further evidence of the effectiveness of remestemcel-L for SR-aGVHD. Mesoblast believes that remestemcel-L meets the criteria for accelerated approval as there are currently no approved treatments for this life-threatening condition in children under 12."

As shortages of hand sanitizers mount across the country amid the coronavirus outbreak, people are investigating ways to make their own homemade versions — but most will not be effective in killing germs, based on Centers for Disease Control recommendations. Hand sanitizer is one of the most in-demand items as people prepare for the new coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, and social media posts and local news outlets have shown the sold-out shelves at grocery stores around the country. As a last resort, people are looking up recipes to make their own with everything from isopropyl alcohol to hydrogen peroxide to vodka, which led the Texas-based Tito’s to remind people on Twitter that vodka is not an effective solution to fight germs. Here’s a Map of All the Coronavirus Cases in the U.S.

Evidence:"Five months of supplementation with 2,400 mg per day of Echinaforce (A.Vogel AG, Switzerland) resulted in a 25% reduction of all respiratory virus, increasing to 43% for enveloped viruses and 48% for coronavirus infections in subjects, according to data published in Frontiers in Pharmacology​.A 99% reduction in viral loads when 4,000 mg of EF was administered during acute RTI episodes, which suggests the limited ability of respiratory viruses to evade the antiviral effects attributed to EF extract, wrote the researchers.“A commercial preparation of Echinacea purpurea in the licensed dosage (Echinaforce extract), represents a safe, easy-to-use and widely available cost-efficient antiviral with effects in preventing respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV2 and reducing virus load,” ​they stated. ​“It may add well to existing counter measures in the current Covid-19 pandemic like vaccinations, social distancing and wearing protective facemasks. Future confirmatory studies are warranted.”​The study was funded by A.Vogel AG.Further substantiation for the inherent preventative qualities of the herb​Commenting independently on the study’ findings, Dr Stefan Gafner, Chief Science Officer at the American Botanical Council, said that preventative studies can be difficult to interpret and limitations in the current trial necessitate further testimony. All the same, results conform with previous findings and further substantial the inherent preventative qualities of the herb, he said.“I hope manufacturers may take a closer look at echinacea as an ingredient, and possibly invest more resources into clinical studies, which may lead to more confidence by consumers about the benefits of their product and therefore increased sales​.”  Additional options             ​​Novel pathogens, like Covid-19, present a significant threat to public health, with vaccines often the first line of defence. Messenger RNA and vector-based vaccines were credited with 90% effectiveness in preventing infections, progression to severe illness, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.However, recent US data demonstrates the short-term potency of Covid vaccines and identified a sharp decline in efficacity after eight months, along with marked differences between vaccine variants, the authors stated.“Additional options are urgently needed to effectively attenuate non-severe infections and naso-oropharyngeal virus concentrations in order to further contain viral dissemination,”​ they said.Echinacea exhibits broad antiviral effects, including for coronaviruses in both adults and children, and particularly formulations containing fresh Echinacea purpurea​ that reduces inflammatory cytokines while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines that respond to invading pathogens.Three-cycle design​The study took place during the Covid-19 pandemic to investigate the antiviral effects of EF on 120 healthy volunteers.Subjects endured three prevention cycles (two lasting two months and the third one month) and were treated with 2,400mg of EF extract daily. Tablets contained 400mg of an hydroethanolic extract of Echinacea purpurea​ (95% external plant and 5% root).All volunteers were Caucasian with a mean age of 36 years."
