Evidence:"This epidemic continues to spread, and there are no vaccines or specific drugs approved or used to prevent or treat COVID-19. A large number of studies have confirmed that high-dose vitamin C can benefit patients with lung injury caused by various inflammatory diseases, especially ARDS and sepsis [27, 30, 33, 34]. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the efficiency and safety of high-dose vitamin C in patients with COVID-19. High-dose vitamin C could decrease mortality and improve the oxygen support status of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, high-dose vitamin C remarkably reduced serum hs-CRP and PCT levels in COVID-19 patients (Figure 3A, 3B).

Prof Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading says: "There are many studies that suggest ibuprofen use during a respiratory infection can result in worsening of the disease or other complications." But, she says, "I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25 year old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications. "Although we don't yet know whether ibuprofen has a particular effect on the severity or length of illnesses caused by coronavirus - either in healthy people or those with underlying conditions - Dr Charlotte Warren-Gash, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says, especially for vulnerable patients, "it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Paracetamol has sold out in many pharmaciesThe spreading of rumours has led to confusionWorries over the use of ibuprofen appear to have surfaced in France, after Jean-Louis Montastruc, a doctor at Toulouse University Hospital warned on Twitter that: "In this period of coronavirus, it is necessary to remember the risk of complications of the NSAIDs in case of fever or infection."

Evidence:"The press regulation campaign group Hacked Off has noted that the Daily Star published an article on 24 March – the day after Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay inside – with the headline “Coronavirus: Fears 5G wifi networks could be acting as ‘accelerator’ for disease”. The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty. One prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on.Direct action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new.

Using plasma of patients convalesced from COVID-19, whose blood contains antibodies against the disease-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been touted as a promising treatment for some patients with signs of infection. UMass Chan Medical School’s Jonathan M. Gerber, MD, the Eleanor Eustis Farrington Chair in Cancer Research, professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and medical director of the UMass Cancer Center, was the first in Massachusetts to successfully treat a seriously ill COVID-19 patient with convalescent plasma, in April 2020. He co-authored a recent report on a multicenter clinical trial from Johns Hopkins Medicine, posted on the preprint website MedRxiv, which found convalescent plasma is effective as an early treatment. Dr. Gerber explained convalescent plasma and what researchers have learned in the past two years about its use in treating COVID-19. The interview has been edited for clarity. What is convalescent plasma and how does it work?Jonathan Gerber: Convalescent plasma is plasma directly collected from the blood of somebody who has recovered from an infection, in this case, COVID-19, and it should be chock-full of antibodies against COVID."

Hindu group touts cow urine elixir for coronavirus

New Delhi (AFP) –

Dozens of Hindu activists held a cow urine party in the Indian capital Saturday to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, as countries around the world struggle to control the deadly pandemic. Members and supporters of All India Hindu Mahasabha staged fire rituals and drank from earthen cups to fight COVID-19 at the gathering in New Delhi dubbed a "gaumutra (cow urine) party".Many in the Hindu-majority nation of 1.3 billion consider cows sacred and in recent years have made several assertions about the liquid being an elixir, claims that critics have rejected as quackery. "Whoever drinks cow urine will be cured and protected," Hari Shankar Kumar, one of the volunteers at the event, told AFP as he served the "remedy" in brown clay cups. Governments and scientists have said no medicine or vaccine is available to protect or cure people of the infection that has killed more than 5,400 people and infected nearly 150,000 across six continents.Two people have died in India while more than 80 have fallen ill, and the government has ordered the closure of some land routes into the country and cancelled all visas to stop the spread of the virus in the world's second most populous country. "We have gathered here and prayed for world peace and we will make an offering to the corona (virus) to calm it," Chakrapani Maharaj, the group's leader, told reporters before gulping down a cup of urine.He then offered a glass to a devil-shaped caricature of the virus to "pacify" it.He urged people to adopt the "tried and tested" practice of drinking cow urine to ward off diseases, and desist from killing animals and eating meat."

Physical distancing is a term used to describe how you should keep your distance from people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing helps reduce the risk of a virus being transmitted and includes:
avoiding crowds and mass gatherings where it is hard to keep a reasonable distance from others (about 1.5 metres) avoiding small gatherings in enclosed spaces
keeping 1.5 metres between you and other people
not shaking hands, hugging or kissing
not visiting vulnerable people, such as those in aged care facilities or hospitals, babies or people with weakened immune systems
It's important that people stay in touch and continue to be social with their family and friends for their own mental health and wellbeing.

Or so it’s claimed.It’s reputed to prevent diabetes, aid weight loss, whiten teeth, lower cholesterol and more.But experts at the University of Mississippi Medical Center question some of the more sensational claims, while affirming others – with reservations.Bidwell“What people see and hear is that if they add apple cider vinegar to their diet, magic things happen,” said Dr. Josie Bidwell, associate professor and clinical director, preventive medicine, at UMMC. “And, unfortunately, it just isn’t the case.“It sends the wrong message to say that just adding something to your diet will fix whatever ails you even if you don’t adjust your other lifestyle factors.”A Lifestyle Medicine Clinician with a Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree, Bidwell periodically encounters patients who ask her if they should surrender to vinegar, “or they’re already using it,” she said.DentDr. Elena Dent, assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine, a registered dietician who has a doctorate in physiology and biophysics, said she has patients who have asked her about the health benefits of ACV for more than a decade.“It has its place,” said Dent, who is also the director of education for the Center for Integrative Health,” but I don’t believe the evidence shows that it will support all the claims you see on Pinterest and Facebook.“I believe it can be a healthy component of a diet, but the best way to use it is on foods – for salads or pickling.”When patients ask whether they should take ACV, both Dent and Bidwell ask them what their goals are – weight loss, lowering blood sugar, and so forth.Often, patients have already been using it.“So I usually ask also how long they’ve been doing it, have they been able to see any benefits, any side effects,” Bidwell said. “And I lay out the evidence for and against those things. If they are doing it safely, I have no problem with it.”The majority in her clinic are hoping to lose weight or control their blood sugar, Bidwell said.Some are eager to take ACV because it’s a natural product, as opposed to prescription medicine.“Many patients want to get off their medications,” Dent said, “but there is no nutritional super food that you can take once or twice a day and fix everything.”Both experts advise patients to talk first with their pharmacist or physician, and don’t abandon their prescriptions.“I also ask them to make sure there are no interactions between their medicine and vinegar,” Dent said."

Evidence:"Ayurveda cannot cure an ailment, or at least it hasn’t been scientifically proven to do so. What it can do though is to improve our resistance to ailments.Therefore, in the context of Covid-19, Ayurvedic practices can improve the chances of our body fighting back the coronavirus if we contract it, but it will not by itself cure us.For Covid-19, and any other serious illness, we should rely on allopathic medicines. That's the only well-known treatment with playbooks that are common across the world. They are a proven form under the tenets of modern science and therefore your best option in the fight against this pandemic.What the future may hold for AyurvedaAyurveda may see an increased rate of adoption, driven by the need to live healthier lifestyles. There are facets of Ayurveda that are already very popular, like Turmeric which the developed world has made edible by making it a Tea additive, and Yoga thanks to the likes of Bikram.But there are many other parts of Ayurveda that are not very popular yet, simply because big pharma and CPG companies cannot easily make money out of naturally occurring ingredients like Turmeric and Tulsi.

Evidence:"Black seed oil
People selling black seed oil — extracted from Nigella sativa, or black cumin seeds — as a COVID-19 treatment have also come under federal scrutiny. In a May warning letter to a company encouraging consumers to fight the coronavirus with black seed oil, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote that no reliable scientific evidence supported claims that black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19. The FDA has sent similar warning letters to companies selling black seed oil to treat or prevent COVID-19 as recently as September. The Journal of Pharmacopuncture, which is focused in part on alternative medicines, published an article in June on Nigella sativa as a "potential herb for COVID-19," but its conclusion was far from the claim in the Instagram post, saying that such a supplement "may reduce the adverse effects of conventional medicines" but that randomized controlled trials were needed to determine any benefits in treating COVID-19 patients. Our ruling
A post on Instagram discourages people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine and instead advocates for "naturopathic solutions," including vitamins D and C, colloidal silver and black seed oil. While research into some supplements like vitamin D has seemed promising, subsequent studies have questioned whether it can protect against COVID-19."

Evidence:"BOSTON – Alcohol sales and consumption increased during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the effect of the increase in consumption on population health is not fully understood. In new research published in Hepatology, a team led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) projected rates of liver disease and associated deaths due to increased alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from a national survey of U.S. adults on their drinking habits that found that excessive drinking (such as binge drinking) increased by 21% during the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientists simulated the drinking trajectories and liver disease trends in all U.S. adults. They estimated that a one-year increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic will result in 8,000 additional deaths from alcohol-related liver disease, 18,700 cases of liver failure, and 1,000 cases of liver cancer by 2040. In the short term, alcohol consumption changes due to COVID-19 are expected to cause 100 additional deaths and 2,800 additional cases of liver failure by 2023. The researchers noted that a sustained increase in alcohol consumption for more than one year could result in 19–35% additional mortality."

Evidence:"On April 7, 2020, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that “although experimental studies show a relationship between higher temperatures and humidity levels, and reduced survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory, there are many other factors besides environmental temperature, humidity, and survival of the virus outside of the host that influence and determine transmission rates among humans in the ‘real world’… with natural history studies, the conditions are relevant and reflect the real-world, but there is typically little control of environmental conditions and there are many confounding factors”4.Between May and November 2020, the European Respiratory Society published several articles discussing the hypothesis that temperature and the spread of COVID-19 are inversely related. Using data from 224 cities in China, one article published in May found no such association6. In August 2020, another analysis using data from China implied a non-linear relationship to the extent that temperature and COVID-19 are not associated below 7 ℃ but that a weak negative association exists above that threshold7. Yet another study published in November found a significant negative association between temperature and the spread of COVID-19 using global data8. While, in general, the evidence is mixed and the debate is still ongoing, laboratory studies found that SARS-CoV-2 is highly susceptible to heat and UV-radiation9,10,11,12,13,14.To add evidence from a different perspective, we use global data to examine the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19 controlling for several important confounding factors. To this end, we regress the prevalence of COVID-19 (logarithmically transformed) at the country level against the latitude of a country."

This Doctor Says a Vegan Diet May Boost COVID Immunity
World-renowned biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell says a vegan diet may help “minimize the severity” of coronavirus infection. The plant-based nutritional expert is well-known for completing one of the most comprehensive studies on human nutrition. Dr. Campbell—along with his son, Thomas M. Campbell— found dietary links between the consumption of animal-based foods like meat, dairy, and eggs and certain diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. The findings were based on studies conducted in the 1980s in 65 Chinese counties where plant-based diets were common. They were published in Dr. Campbell’s 2005 book, “The China Study.” The publication is now one of America’s best-selling nutrition books. Based on the findings, Dr. Campbell says a plant-based diet may spur the immune system into producing more antibodies."

World’s Largest Study on ACE Inhibitors, ARBs Shows No Increased Patient Risk of COVID-19 Diagnosis, Complications 
While the COVID-19 pandemic left the world searching for answers during the earliest stages of the pandemic, one immediate healthcare concern regarded the use of certain antihypertensives, and whether they posed increased risks to patients dealing with hypertension.Evidence, generated by global collaborators within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community and recently published in The Lancet Digital Health, found that there was no increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, or subsequent complications for users of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among an international cohort of more than 1.1 million patients using antihypertensives.This real-world evidence, generated through open-science approaches, support recent regulatory and clinical recommendations that patients should not discontinue ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy due to concerns of increased COVID-19 risk.“People with hypertension have worse COVID-19 outcomes, and there remains speculation that some anti-hypertensive medications may be detrimental,” says corresponding author Marc A. Suchard, a professor at UCLA and research team leader. “The clear answer is that ACE inhibitors and ARBs pose no increased risk as compared to other treatments.”While other studies have generated similar findings recently, this study is the most comprehensive one to date of COVID-19 susceptibility risks for antihypertensive users. OHDSI researchers examined electronic health records from a trio of data sources from the United States and Spain (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Information System for Research in Primary Care) to conduct a systematic cohort study of ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and thiazide diuretic (THZ) users.Furthermore, the findings showed no clinical reason to switch from an ARB to an ACE inhibitor to minimize COVID-19 risk. “Based on our results, if there is a risk difference, it’s marginal and would be very challenging to further refine outside such a large-scale international study,” Suchard said.Powered by open-source tools, state-of-the-art analytical methods and global collaboration within the OHDSI community, these findings provide robust and reproducible real-world evidence. The study design was specifically cited by the European Medicines Agency in the latest version of The European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) Guide on Methodological Standards in Pharmacoepidemiology following its release on a preprint server:Morales et al. supported the reproducibility of their study by publishing the study protocol in the EU PAS Register ahead of time, providing a start-to-finish executable code, facilitating the sharing and exploration of the complete result set with an interactive web application and asking clinicians and epidemiologists to perform a blinded evaluation of propensity score diagnostics for the treatment comparisons.“By comparing people exposed to ACE inhibitor and ARBs against people taking other antihypertensives, either alone or in combination, using two methods across three database the study generated 1280 comparisons to assess the safety of these drugs, producing highly consistent results,” says lead author Daniel Morales, Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Dundee.The International COVID-ACE Receptor Inhibition Utilization and Safety (ICARIUS) protocol, code, and results are all available for further exploration at https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Covid19Icarius.“Open science and collaboration are tenets of the OHDSI community, and they were never more important than early in this pandemic, when we all knew very little about critical questions like antihypertensive risks around COVID-19,” said George Hripcsak, Chair of the Columbia Department of Biomedical Informatics, the coordinating center for OHDSI, and a member of the Columbia Data Science Institute."

The harmful impact of smoking on the lungs is well documented, and there is growing evidence that vaping (use of e-cigarettes) can harm lung health as well:There is conclusive evidence that smoking increases susceptibility for respiratory infections, weakens the immune system and is a major cause of underlying health conditions that increase risk for COVID-19, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other lung diseases, heart disease and diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Being a current or former cigarette smoker can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.”There is growing evidence that vaping can also harm lung health. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has stated that “emerging evidence suggests that exposure to aerosols from e-cigarettes harms the cells of the lung and diminishes the ability to respond to infection.” Adding to these concerns is the fact that youth e-cigarette use remains at epidemic levels in the U.S. 3.6 million U.S. kids use e-cigarettes, including 1 in five high school students (19.6%).Learn more about what leading public health organizations and medical experts have said about smoking, vaping and COVID-19.Act Now to Reduce Smoking and VapingAs a result, there has never been a more important time to take action to reduce smoking and vaping.We urge smokers and vapers to make every effort to quit.

Evidence:"You will be able to get a quick price and instant permission to reuse the content in many different ways. general medicine (see internal medicine)blood bank & transfusion medicineimmunologyinfectious diseasesSimilar to the SARS-CoV experience,1 a possible link between ABO blood groups with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity has been shown in multiple observational studies.2–4 Gérard et al
5 have further noted that people with B and/or O blood groups were less represented among COVID-19 patients, thereby highlighting the possible beneficial role of anti-A antibodies in COVID-19 susceptibility. In fact, it was known that anti-A antibodies can block the adhesion of SARS-CoV S-protein to ACE2 expressing cell lines.6 Given the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it might be prudent to hypothesise a protective role of anti-A antibodies against COVID-19 severity as well. However, existing clinical evidence in this regard is controversial. Hoiland et al
7 had reported that critically ill COVID-19 patients with blood groups A and AB (lacking anti-A antibodies) were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care compared with patients with B/O (with anti-A antibodies). However, a genomewide association study of severe COVID-19 patients showed that those with blood group A had a higher risk of severe disease, while blood group O had a protective effect.8 Other studies found no association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 severity/mortality.9–12 We aimed to summarise the available literature and provide a pooled analysis of the effect of A/AB (without anti-A antibodies) on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients compared with B/O (with anti-A antibodies) blood groups.This meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.13 We (SB and MB) independently performed a systematic search of the literature across the PubMed database from inception till 30 November 2020, using the following keywords interposed with appropriate Boolean operators: “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND “ABO blood groups”.Observational studies of case–control or cohort design were selected."

Evidence:"Adults of any age who currently smoke or who are former smokers, as well as those living with certain underlying medical conditions that are often caused by smoking, such as cancer and COPD, are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. For more information, visit the CDC People with Certain Medical Conditions web page. Quitting smoking may reduce your risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. Using an FDA-approved medication, such as nicotine replacement patches, and treatment and support from your health care provider can improve your ability to quit for good by helping manage cravings and withdrawal from addictive nicotine. There is growing evidence that vaping can damage lung health, and research is underway to determine if using e-cigarettes or other vapor products increases the risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Evidence:"High-CBD Strains of Cannabis Sativa Show Promise in Preventing COVID-19
Searching for new and innovative ways to fight the growing COVID-19 threat, a team of Canadian researchers from the University of Lethbridge turned to the medicinal properties of cannabis. Focusing specifically on anti-inflammatory, high-CBD cannabis sativa extracts, the scientists found that this strain could potentially block the COVID-19 virus from entering a person’s body altogether. Their work was published online in an April issue of Preprints, an online medical journal. Their article highlighted the body’s ACE2 receptors, which act as doorways for the virus. Cannabis decreases the levels of ACE2 gene expression, temporarily closing the door to the virus to prevent infection. Cannabis sativa also has the ability to prevent the virus from propagating once in a person’s system, further helping prevent the more harmful symptoms of COVID-19."

  Controversy over data in hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 study grows

Copied to clipboard
The editors of The Lancet yesterday issued a statement acknowledging the criticism of a recent study that concluded that the antimalaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine did not benefit COVID-19 patients and were associated with higher risk of death and serious heart rhythm complications.The statement comes in response to a letter signed by more than 100 scientists and clinicians worldwide that raised questions about the data behind the large observational study.The Lancet said in its statement that important scientific questions had been raised about the data reported in the paper, and that an independent audit of the data commissioned by the authors is ongoing.The study, published in The Lancet on May 22, compared outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without macrolide antibiotics) with those who received neither drug, and was the largest to date on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. But in the days following publication, several scientists took to social media to express skepticism about the study and the data on which it was based, and that criticism has continued.In an open letter to Lancet Editor Richard Horton late last week, critics raised concerns about the methodology of the study, asked that a group convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) perform an independent validation of the analysis, and requested that the journal make peer review comments on the study openly available.Concerns about bias and confoundingAmong the concerns laid out in the letter are that there was inadequate adjustment for known and measured confounders, such as severity of illness.That's been a common criticism of several of the observational studies on use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19: that many of the patients treated with the drugs in these studies have been sicker. Experts say that the inability to fully account for more severe disease among patients treated with the drug skews the results. "Because it is an observational study, we know that bias and confounding can really affect the results," said Ruanne Barnabas, MBChB, DPhil, a physician and associate professor of global health at the University of Washington who signed the letter. "My concern about it being observational was that it [hydroxychloroquine] was used compassionately for people who were more sick and likely to do worse anyway…so we would not be able to assess the impact using the study design."

COVID-19: Monoclonal Antibody Treatment
What are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and how do they work? An antibody is a protein that the body’s immune system makes to fight off viruses and other foreign substances. Monoclonal antibodies are man-made antibodies produced in a laboratory that can mimic the human immune system response to infection. Are there different brands of monoclonal antibodies? There are three different mAbs."

Evidence:"In particular, infant babies have a low ability to make IgA on their own. Therefore, IgA in breast milk is important for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, it is found that breast milk contains a large amount of IgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. In this respect, the importance of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was shown. In preliminary studies, it has already been reported that a single dose of the
 BNT162b2 vaccine markedly induces neutralized IgG activation against the B.1.1.7 variant in people previously infected with original SARS-CoV-2. However, compared to the method of antibody titers of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, the method for evaluating the antibody titer of IgA against original SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants has not yet made great progress."

Evidence:"One thing to keep in mind: Using a nebulizer for albuterol treatments may increase the amount of virus in the air if the person has a respiratory virus like COVID-19. This could potentially spread the virus to others more easily, since the virus may stay in air droplets for up to several hours.Talk with your child's asthma care provider about which delivery method is best for them. Shortages of albuterol inhalers have previously been reported in some areas, and some insurances have not covered spacers. Best practices are probably going to be different based on location and a child's individual needs.

Evidence:"(1) This clinical study added to others that are in progress and that also evaluate the potential of EPA and DHA would provide a very useful tool to medicine and of course to patients with COVID 19. As is well known, Omega3 supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that are essential in the proper functioning of the immune system. The researchers speculated that Omega3's ability to rapidly block the signs of inflammation may stop the formation of the cytokine storm, thus preventing the acute respiratory distress that can lead to death in severe cases of COVID-19,(1). The principal investigator noted that this is a pilot study of 100 patients and even though statistically not enough - along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA - "strongly suggest that these marine fatty acids may help reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients."

Evidence:"One study even suggests that echinacea extract exerted an antiviral action on the development of recurrent cold sores triggered by the herpes simplex virus (HSVI) when taken prior to infection.Common ColdWhether or not echinacea helps prevent or treat the common cold remains controversial. Some studies have shown that the herb can make you feel better faster. Others suggest that echinacea has no impact on a cold at all. Several clinical trials have shown that people who take echinacea as soon as they feel sick reduce the severity of their cold and have fewer symptoms than those who do not take the herb. One study of 95 people with early symptoms of cold and flu (such as runny nose, scratchy throat, and fever) found that those who drank several cups of echinacea tea every day for 5 days felt better sooner than those who drank tea without echinacea.A review of 14 clinical trials found that echinacea reduced the odds of developing a cold by 58% and the duration of a cold by 1 to 4 days. However, some experts dispute these findings claiming there were several weaknesses in the analyses."
