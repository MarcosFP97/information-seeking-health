Evidence:"Here’s what you need to know.Vitamin D and COVID-19While vitamin D boosts your immune system and eases inflammation, experts say more research is needed on its antiviral properties.Several studies indicate that those with low vitamin D levels are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worse clinical outcomes after infection. And while high levels of vitamin D might lower your risk for severe COVID-19 infection, there is no evidence that taking vitamin D supplements will provide protection against infection or improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.Vitamin D and Other ConditionsNot getting enough vitamin D may lead to or worsen these health problems:Heart diseaseHigh blood pressureDiabetesInfections and issues with your immune systemCertain types of cancer like colon, prostate, and breast cancersMultiple sclerosisPneumoniaBlood clotsAll these can raise your risk for severe COVID-19 if infected.Research shows that obesity and diabetes are linked to low levels of vitamin D. They’re also associated with higher death rates or severe COVID-19 symptoms.How to Get More Vitamin DMore sunlight and foods rich in vitamin D are the best ways. Try to get 15-20 minutes of sunlight, three days a week. And eat foods like:Oily fish (like salmon or sardines)Red meatEgg yolksFoods with vitamin D addedSupplements are also an option. Ask your doctor how much vitamin D you need before taking them. If you overdo it, you may have symptoms like:NauseaIncreased thirst and urinationPoor appetiteConstipationWeaknessConfusionAtaxia, a neurological condition that causes you to slur or stumble Show Sources SOURCES:Medscape: “High Vitamin D Levels May Not Protect Against COVID-19.”University of Chicago Medicine: “Study suggests high vitamin D levels may protect against COVID-19, especially for Black people.”JAMA Network: “Association of Vitamin D Levels, Race/Ethnicity, and Clinical Characteristics With COVID-19 Test Results.”Journal of the American Medical Association: “Effect of a Single High Dose of Vitamin D3 on Hospital Length of Stay in Patients With Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.”Clinical Medicine Journal: “Does vitamin D deficiency increase the severity of COVID-19?”Cleveland Clinic: “Vitamin D Deficiency,” “42% Percent of Americans Are Vitamin D Deficient."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"High doses are being studied for their potential to decrease lung inflammation, but more research is needed.Vitamin C and COVID-19In an article published in the Chinese Journal of Infection Diseases, the Shanghai Medical Association endorsed the use of high dose vitamin C as a treatment for hospitalized people with COVID-19 (10).Doses that are magnitudes higher than the DV are recommended to be given through IV to improve lung function, which may help keep a patient off of mechanical ventilation or life support (10, 11, 12).Additionally, a 2019 review found that both oral and IV high dose vitamin C treatment may aid people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for critical illnesses by reducing ICU stay length by 8% and shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% (13).Chinese researchers have also registered a clinical trial to further study the effectiveness of IV vitamin C in hospitalized people with COVID-19 (14).However, it’s important to note that vitamin C is not yet a standard part of the treatment plan for COVID-19 because evidence is still lacking (10, 15). Though high dose IV vitamin C is currently being tested to see if it can improve lung function in people with COVID-19, no evidence suggests that high doses of oral vitamin C supplements can help with the disease. In fact, they can cause complications like diarrhea (2).SummaryHigh dose IV vitamin C has been used in China to help improve lung function in people with COVID-19. However, vitamin C’s effectiveness is still being tested. There’s no evidence to support the use of oral vitamin C supplements for COVID-19.Do you need to supplement?Currently, no evidence supports the use of oral vitamin C supplements to prevent COVID-19.Vitamin C may help shorten the duration and severity of colds caused by other viruses, but this is no guarantee that it will have the same effect on the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Additionally, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. It dissolves in water, meaning that excess amounts aren’t stored in your body but instead eliminated through your urine."
Question:Can vitamin C cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Advice to use paracetamol is also less likely to result in complications.”Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, said that ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory properties could “dampen down” the immune system, which could slow the recovery process. He added that it was likely, based on similarities between the new virus (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS I, that covid-19 reduces a key enzyme that part regulates the water and salt concentration in the blood and could contribute to the pneumonia seen in extreme cases. “Ibuprofen aggravates this, while paracetamol does not,” he said.Charlotte Warren-Gash, associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “For covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions. In the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.”Rupert Beale, an infectious diseases researcher at the Francis Crick Institute, had a warning on cortisone, however. “Patients taking cortisone or other steroids should not stop them except on advice from their doctor,” he said.The complex role that the immune system might play in covid-19 disease has been underscored by reports that Swiss drug company Roche has secured approval from China for its anti-inflammation drug Actemra (tocilizumab) to treat patients developing severe complications from covid-19.Some doctors in Italy, including Paolo Ascierto of the Pascale Hospital in Naples, claim that they have had success treating severely ill patients with the drug, which blocks the key inflammatory molecule interleukin-6.There is speculation that the drug might prevent fatal “cytokine storms,” in which the immune system of seriously ill patients can cause organ failure.This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In early 2020 with the first outbreak of Covid-19, North Korea had sealed its borders in order to insulate itself from the pandemic. Its leadership has so far rejected outside medical support from China and South Korea. North Korea’s state media has recommended traditional treatments to deal with what is referred to as "fever". For those not seriously ill, ruling-party newspaper Rodong Simnun recommended remedies including ginger or honeysuckle tea and a willow-leaf drink, the BBC report states. Hot drinks might soothe some Covid symptoms, such as a sore throat or cough, and help hydration when patients are losing more fluid than normal. Ginger and willow leaf also relieve inflammation and reduce pain."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In recent days there have been suspected arson attacks on mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Merseyside. Celebrities have pushed the idea that 5G is harmful and linked to Covid-19. The government has been forced to address the fears, with Michael Gove branding the theories “dangerous nonsense”. To be clear, these theories are wrong. As you'll see from our fact checks linked throughout this article, there's no connection between 5G and coronavirus, and no evidence of any health risk from 5G. But it's not clear that simply dismissing them is the right approach."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, people reported that they have changed their behavior accordingly. In two studies comprising thousands of people, up to 57.6% of individuals reported having used nutritional supplements or herbal products, usually as teas, in attempts to protect themselves from COVID-19 [24, 25]. Therefore, we wondered how effective herbal teas actually are against SARS-CoV-2 and tested the in vitro antiviral activity of herbal infusions against SARS-CoV-2 variants including VOCs.ResultsPerilla and sage contain water-soluble heat-stable components active against SARS-CoV-2 replicationTo evaluate two universally available Lamiaceae commonly used in traditional medicine, perilla and sage, in terms of their ability to elicit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we applied a cell culture experimental setup that reflects short-term incubation of infected cells with herbal teas. We infected Vero E6 cells, a highly SARS-CoV-2-permissive cell line derived from African green monkey and broadly used for SARS-CoV-2 infections, for 1 h before the virus suspension was removed and different dilutions of aqueous infusions of perilla and sage were added afterwards (Fig. 1A). As control, we included coriander, an herb that does not belong to the family of Lamiaceae and that is to our knowledge not commonly used as medicinal herb."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The safety profile of co-administering Prevnar 20 with a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine generally reflected that observed with the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose.Dr Kathrin Jansen, Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer commented: “These new safety and immunogenicity data provide further evidence supporting the potential to administer Prevnar 20 and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, thereby reducing the number of visits adults make to their doctor’s office or pharmacy for recommended immunisation.”The initiation of the study exploring the co-administration of Prevnar 20 with a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in older adults was announced in May 2021. Pfizer said it will seek to present and publish detailed outcomes from this clinical trial at a future date. At this time no co-administration data are included in the PREVNAR 20 or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine prescribing information.About Prevnar 20Prevnar 20 is Pfizer’s next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharide conjugates for the 13 serotypes already included in Prevnar 13® (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) and seven additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) that cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and have been associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis. Prevnar 20 helps protect against more strains of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia than any other conjugate vaccine available.Influenza vaccine with COVID-19 booster shot shows positive results…Related topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, Research & Development (R&D), VaccinesRelated organisationsPfizerRelated drugsCOMIRNATY®, Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20Related peopleDr Kathrin JansenRelated diseases & conditionsCoronavirus, Covid-19, meningitis, Pneumococcal disease              By Hannah Balfour (European Pharmaceutical Review)14 January 2022No comments yetShares11             Share via  Pinterest Reddit Buffer Xing WhatsApp FlipboardRelated topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, Research & Development (R&D), VaccinesRelated organisationsPfizerRelated drugsCOMIRNATY®, Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20Related peopleDr Kathrin JansenRelated diseases & conditionsCoronavirus, Covid-19, meningitis, Pneumococcal disease                  Most popular...Major study on DMT shows promise for depressionFirst CAR T-cell therapy recommended on NHSEMA validates first regulatory submission for CRISPR-based medicinePersonalised cancer immunotherapy granted fast track designationOnivyde® improves survival in Phase III pancreatic cancer trial

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The ongoing clinical studies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease should certainly encompass sex-sensitive analyses. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.The accumulated data so far indicate that sex hormones could be critical in explaining sex-related differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Fig. 1). However, variables are several: normal, hypofunctional or hyperfunctional phenotypes could act differently, the genetic and epigenetic background is certainly playing a crucial role,steroidal sex hormones are not the same, and several synthetic and natural molecules interact with the steroid receptors.Fig. 1Role of sex hormones in COVID-19Full size imageConsidering the clinical and therapeutic use of sex steroid hormones and/or their inhibitors is a possibility.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Pragya Thakur has said that drinking cow urine can help prevent coronavirus disease (Covid-19), adding that her remark had “scientific backing”.Addressing party workers in Bhopal on Sunday, Thakur said: “I consumed cow urine daily and it is a kind of acid which purifies my body. It also purifies the lungs and saves me from Covid-19 infection. She, however, defended the statement.“ I have recommended these because they have scientific backing. Research has already established it,” she said.Health experts, however, warned against relying on what they called “unscientific claims” amid the second wave of the pandemic.“At least, now these leaders should stop recommending unscientific treatments,” Dr Ranjan Sharma, president Indian Medical Association said."

VERDICT
There is currently no strong evidence for the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Overall, the limited studies identified were subject to methodological flaws. Several ongoing trials of  lopinavir/ritonavir are currenty recruiting. BACKGROUND
There are currently no pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatments, there has been increased interest in re-purposing currently available drugs for immediate use. The antiretroviral drug lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, which is widely used for the treatment of HIV and is a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Does UV Light Kill COVID in the Air? UV Air Sterilization
Many scientists believe that airborne particles are one of the most common modes of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus sterilizing and disinfecting air in enclosed spaces should help to protect people against contracting the COVID-19 disease. UVC lamps in HVAC units are an effective method of sterilizing air and is utilized in many commercial, industrial, and residential air purification systems. A recent study published in Scientific Reports concludes that UVC light is effective at killing airborne human coronaviruses including those that cause the common cold and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Based on what we know about ultraviolet light, specifically UV light emitted in the UVC range, many studies are showing that UV light may be used as a valuable tool to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in liquid, on surfaces and in the air. Far-UVC light may be a good choice for some disinfection applications with less harmful health risks to human exposure."

Evidence:"Black cumin oil and seeds will speed up the cure of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, prevent the development of severe COVID-19, and even help not to die from this infection. Black cumin, when prescribed for prophylactic purposes, will prevent symptomatic COVID-19 from developing. Just to be clear: A number of clinical trials have confirmed that black seed does help with COVID-19. Another question is how reliable these studies are. Again, there is no consensus on the pharmaceutical purity of black cumin seeds and oil. Black seed is especially in demand in the current environment when there are essentially no widely available drugs that are unconditionally effective against SARS-CoV-2, and the population is in no hurry to be vaccinated en masse."

Evidence:"It is strongly recommended that you receive both vaccines for maximum protection. Can Tamiflu or the flu shot treat COVID-19? Tamiflu or a flu shot will not directly treat or lessen the symptoms of COVID-19. But you can get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, which can help prevent an infection and lessen severity. And if you get sick with influenza or have been exposed to it, you can take antiviral medication like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to prevent getting sick. COVID-19 treatment options are available and vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and health history."

Evidence:"Neem oil can also be used to manage some fungal disease issues, such as powdery mildew. It works by preventing the germination and penetration of fungal spores into leaf tissue. Neem won’t “cure” a plant that is already infected with a fungal disease, but it can help limit the spread of the disease to healthy tissue. Neem oil products are often labelled for a variety of crops such as herbs, vegetables, fruits, nuts and ornamental plants. Regardless of the type of plant being treated, neem oil can damage plants by burning their foliage. Do not use on recent transplants or otherwise stressed plants."

Evidence:"Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►
Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 
In this recently published Cochrane review, authors explored the effects of treating COVID-19 with remdesivir, an antiviral medication. First author Kelly Ansems said "Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening." Key messages
For adults hospitalised with COVID-19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care. The review authors are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID-19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas."
Question:Can remdesivir cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Then, we describe the possible therapeutic effects of curcumin and its molecular mechanism against coronavirus-19. Curcumin, as an active constituent of Curcuma longa (turmeric), has been studied in several experimental and clinical trial studies. Curcumin has some useful clinical effects such as antiviral, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antifatigue effects that could be effective to manage the symptoms of the infected patient with COVID-19. It has several molecular mechanisms including antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic properties with inhibitory effects on Toll-like receptors, NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and bradykinin. Scientific evidence suggests that curcumin could have a potential role to treat COVID-19. Thus, the use of curcumin in the clinical trial, as a new treatment option, should be considered."
Question:Can turmeric treat COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"“That’s why it leads to more infections, food allergies, and problems like that,” he says. Instead of going fully vegan or vegetarian, the study suggests maximizing the intake of plant foods in a balanced diet. A switch from processed foods to simple, plant-based foods could reduce harmful gut bacteria in a matter of weeks, Spector adds. However, maintaining a plant-based diet may not be financially sustainable in some communities. “The impact of diet was amplified by individual life situations, with people living in low-income neighborhoods and having the lowest quality diet being around 25% more at risk from COVID-19 than people in more affluent communities who were eating in the same way,” the researchers wrote in a press release. Diet Does Not Replace Vaccines  
Scientists still have a lot to learn about the roles diet and microbiome play in managing COVID-19 risks."
Question:Can a vegetarian diet prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"People weren't getting together in large groups. So all the things that prevent COVID also prevent flu, and there were very, very few flu cases," she says. "This year, we're afraid that with, in a lot of places, masking recommendations being relaxed, that flu will spread more easily. And the fact that no one had flu last year means there are a lot more people who are vulnerable this year. So again, another very good reason to get the flu vaccine." She says if you haven't been vaccinated for COVID-19 yet or need a third dose, you can get your flu shot and get vaccinated for COVID-19 at the same time."
Question:Can getting a flu shot prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The patients who did not receive ACEI or ARB did not see any other therapeutic benefit in their condition of not receiving ACEI or ARB, suggesting that ACEI or ARB did not worsen the condition of COVID-19 patients. Although the pulmonary CT changes of patients in each group were not analyzed in this study, clinical prognosis suggested that the use of ACEI or ARB would not promote the secondary spread of the virus in the lungs of patients, or the possibility of secondary infection was low. Whether the use of ACEI or ARB can aggravate the pneumonia-induced damage in COVID-19 patients is a major point of contention in the use of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.Most studies investigating whether ARBs/ACEIs aggravate COVID-19 induced pneumonia have indicated that inhibition of the RAAS system upregulates the expression of ACE2 and alleviates viral pneumonia [14]. On both axes of the RAAS system, the consequence of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis causes hypertension and exacerbates lung injury, while it is counteracted by the ACE2/Ang 1–7/MasR axis [12, 13], protecting the lung function [25, 26]. The clinical examination of patients from Wuhan with COVID-19 induced pneumonia showed that IL-1b, IFN-, IL-10, and other inflammatory factors were significantly increased when patients were admitted to the hospital, and the expression level of G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, and TNF were upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. This suggests that there is a correlation between the cytokines/inflammatory factors and the severity of the disease [27]."
Question:Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"I requested my proposal to be mentioned in the retraction letter, but that was also rejected by the editors. I disagree with the retraction and I consider it unfair and unsubstantiated.”The director of Quit Victoria, Dr Sarah White, said retracting the paper was the right move.“We really rely in research in being able to take a dispassionate look at the data but also the interpretation of that data,” she said. “The reader needs to know that the authors have some potential or actual conflict of interest, or they’ve actually been involved with the industry.”Big tobacco giving retailers cash and international trips to promote products, study findsRead moreShe added there was no strong evidence to support the claim that smokers were less likely to acquire Covid or suffer severe effects from it.An analysis for the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine “identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in Covid-19”.The authors of that paper said there had been several studies that reported a so-called “smoker’s paradox” with Covid-19, suggesting smokers might somehow be protected from infection and severe complications.“As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable,” the review found.“In the context of smoking and Covid-19, poor data collection can lead to several erroneous conclusions. If patients with missing smoking data are not eliminated from the total pool, smokers may be wrongly underrepresented. Furthermore, it is difficult to get accurate history from patients who are either intubated or in respiratory failure.“If data from these patients are missing, and these patients are not removed from the denominator, it can give a false impression that smokers are less likely to develop severe disease."
Question:Can smoking prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Muniz-Diaz et al. found that blood group A has significantly high risk of mortality as compared to non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O is associated with significantly low risk of mortality (Muniz-Diaz et al., 2021). Our study contrasts with these studies, as we found that ABO and Rh blood groups are not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Similar to the current results, Solmaz and Araç also found that blood groups have no association with mortality of the patients (Solmaz and Araç, 2021).ConclusionOur study has found that blood groups A, B, and Rh+ are more disposed to COVID-19 infection, whereas blood groups O, AB, and Rh− are significantly of lower risk of COVID-19 infection. ABO and Rh blood groups show no impact on the progression of disease and are not associated with susceptibility to severity of disease or mortality. We also found that blood groups A and Rh+ types are associated with a decrease in recovery period, whereas blood groups O and Rh− are associated with increase in recovery period.However, the ABO and/or Rh blood groups may not be responsible for this association, as these may indicate an unexplored underlying factor like comorbidity."
Question:Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19 The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"While they are not alcohol-based, and thus not recommended by CDC, there are some hand sanitizer products containing benzalkonium chloride as an active ingredient that may be legally marketed if they meet the requirements for marketing under section 505G of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, as noted above, there are no hand sanitizers, including those containing benzalkonium chloride, that are legally marketed specifically for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Hand sanitizers using active ingredients other than alcohol (ethanol), isopropyl alcohol, or benzalkonium chloride are not legally marketed, and FDA recommends that consumers avoid their use. Q. What is the risk of using a hand sanitizer that contains methanol (wood alcohol)? A: FDA is warning consumers and health care professionals about hand sanitizers that contain methanol, also known as wood alcohol, because it is a dangerous and toxic substance."
Question:Can methanol prevent COVID-19 The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Early symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing – similar to other flu-like illnesses. Until everyone is vaccinated, preventing the spread of COVID-19 from person to person is vital to reduce the pandemic's impact on people’s lives, health, livelihoods and the healthcare systems we all rely on. Handwashing is key to preventing coronavirus
Frequent, thorough handwashing with soap and water is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and is an important defence against COVID-19. Like a cold, coronaviruses are spread through droplets from a person coughing or sneezing, and via contaminated surfaces. Good hygiene is key to avoiding spreading it – and catching it. Along with other important behaviours such as physical distancing and wearing a mask, thoroughly washing hands often and at key moments is essential to controlling the pandemic."
Question:Can handwashing prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Moreover, it is possible to hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication may be facilitated or induced through mechanisms related to nAChR-mediated pathways, all converging to ACE2 regulation and signalling [14, 24]. Additionally, nicotine exposure induces a pro-thrombotic state via stimulation of tissue factor expression both in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [25] as well as neo-angiogenesis [26] and, finally, elevated serum cotinine levels, the metabolite of nicotine, are associated with left atrial abnormalities, a possible mechanism for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [27]. Importantly, post mortem examinations of people who died with COVID-19 revealed widespread vascular abnormalities including thrombosis, microangiopathy, and a high degree of angiogenesis [28]. Taking into consideration all the above findings and the observation that nicotine potentiates viral infections [29], it is unlikely that smoking or vaping may offer therapeutic benefits in COVID-19.Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of action through which nicotine could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Evidence on the regulation of ACE2 in the lungs after exposure to nicotine is still inconclusive, with evidence both for down-regulated ACE2 axis [30], in bronchial epithelial cells [31] and for enhanced ACE2 expression in lung tissue of COPD patients, at a lower extent in healthy smokers, and absent in healthy non-smoking individuals [22, 32–34].It is important to remark that, until now, there is no indication that nicotine prevents the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells or that it protects cells from the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for this reason, we planned studies where cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence or absence of nicotine.We investigated here whether ACE2 is overexpressed in pneumocytes after exposure to nicotine, and if this leads in turn to increased SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathic effect.Materials and methodsCells exposure to nicotineNicotine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) was assayed using in vitro experiments for its ability to stimulate ACE2 expression in A549 cells. The A549 type II pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line (isolated in 1973, [35]) was selected because of the low-levels of ACE2 expression."
Question:Can Nicotine help COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A report on the research, “Cannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Emerging Variants,” was published online on Monday by the Journal of Natural Products. The researchers found that two cannabinoid acids commonly found in hemp varietals of cannabis, cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, also known as CBDA, can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. By binding to the spike protein, the compounds can prevent the virus from entering cells and causing infection, potentially offering new avenues to prevent and treat the disease. Compounds in cannabis can prevent infection by the virus that causes Covid-19, according to research ... [+] published this week.getty
“Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2,” the researchers wrote in an abstract of the study. The study was led by Richard van Breemen, a researcher with Oregon State’s Global Hemp Innovation Center in the College of Pharmacy and Linus Pauling Institute, in collaboration with scientists at the Oregon Health & Science University. Van Breeman said that the cannabinoids studied are common and readily available."

Evidence:"The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I² = 0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I² = 0%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine. Findings have unclear generalizability to outpatients, children, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities. IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential of progression into respiratory failure and death1.

Evidence:"These antibodies are given to people directly through an intravenous (IV) infusion. How does monoclonal antibody therapy help? Monoclonal antibody therapy is a way of treating COVID-19 for people who have tested positive, have had mild symptoms for seven days or less, and are at high risk for developing more serious symptoms. The goal of this therapy is to help prevent hospitalizations, reduce viral loads, and lessen symptom severity. The FDA has authorized the emergency use of monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for people 12 years of age or older. “In multiple randomized controlled trials, high-risk outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 were 2-7% less likely to be hospitalized with severe COVID-19,” Spivak says."

Cleaning and disinfecting your home are effective ways to prevent the spread of illnesses and disease. In most situations, cleaning alone can remove most germs, such as harmful viruses or bacteria, on surfaces. Disinfecting to reduce the spread of diseases at home is likely not needed unless someone in your home is sick or if someone sick has recently visited. Cleaning is done with water, soap, and scrubbing."

Evidence:"Omega-3s are also well-known mediators of inflammation and can amplify anti-inflammatory responses. Since accumulating evidence suggests inflammation-induced lung injury and dysregulated immune responses play roles in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, omega-3s may be an attractive approach to preventing and mitigating severe outcomes by resolving the cytokine storm. Evidence has recently become available that demonstrates this may be the case. A pilot study published in January of 2021 compared the associations between the Omega-3 Index (a measure of omega-3s EPA and DHA in the blood) and risk for death from COVID-19 in 100 patients. Researchers found that patients with an Omega-3 Index of >5.7% were at about 75% lower risk for death than those below that value. This was the first study to directly test the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids could benefit COVID-19 patients."

Evidence:"Their development according to the highest quality standards and needs for off-the-shelf deployment is preferentially achieved through a commercial route. Therefore, an overview of MSC trials conducted by companies may help to gauge the validity of this approach.Several companies are repurposing their MSC products for therapeutic use in COVID-19. For example, Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq: MESO; ASX: MSB), a global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, has recently proposed the use of ryoncil® (remestemcel-L) to treat patients with moderate to severe ARDS. The compound is currently under priority review by the FDA for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. Pilot data indicate that survival rate was 83% in ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients when treated with two intravenous infusions of remestemcel-L, whereas the survival rate was only 12% in those receiving standard of care during the same period. Remestemcel-L is believed to counteract the pathological process by downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.To confirm these pilot data, Mesoblast has launched a Phase III randomized controlled trial (NCT04371393) of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS."

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. "Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry," the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible. Sold-out hand sanitizer products has many people turning to DIY recipes for making their own. Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images
But popular recipes spreading on social media for making your own hand sanitizer may not be up to the task, particularly if the alcohol used becomes too diluted by other ingredients."
