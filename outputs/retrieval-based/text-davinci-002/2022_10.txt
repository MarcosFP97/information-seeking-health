Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The scientific evidence suggests that no, crystals do not have any mystic powers or attributes that can aid in physical, mental or spiritual healing or wellbeing. Rather, the powers or vibrations people claim to feel from crystals are more likely to be a case of being susceptible to the power of suggestion, or the placebo effect. In saying that, the power of positive thought has been proved to reduce the risk of disease. For example, Johns Hopkins expert Lisa R. Yanek, M.P.H., found that people with a family history of heart disease who also had a positive outlook were one-third less likely to have a heart attack or other cardiovascular event within five to 25 years than those with a more negative outlook. Additional studies have found that a positive attitude improves outcomes and life satisfaction across a spectrum of conditions—including traumatic brain injury, stroke and brain tumors. So, perhaps the power of crystals could also be linked to the power of positive thought, and the idea that believing in something can manifest it."

Evidence:"Currently, there is no medical treatment than can slow down, much less reverse, the joint damage from arthritis. The standard of care focuses primarily on alleviating symptoms but medications prescribed for arthritis often have unwanted side effects.According to a recent review published in the journal International Orthopaedics, researchers have demonstrated that collagen protein supplementation can improve osteoarthritis symptoms.The review consisted of 5 separate randomized controlled trials published from 2009 to 2016, with a total of 519 patients. Treatment periods ranged from 10 weeks to 48 weeks. Treatment with collagen supplementation demonstrated a significant reduction of the total WOMAC index, a clinical tool used to assess the degree of arthritis (1) , and a significant reduction in stiffness and VAS score (a clinical “scoring” tool used to assess degree of pain) .The beneficial effects of collagen for the treatment and prevention of arthritis are not recognized by the conventional medical community. As described in my book, “The Collagen Diet,” collagen peptides that are broken into small fragments are the specific type of collagen that has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of degenerative conditions, including osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.When we ingest collagen peptides, they are further broken down into single amino acids and peptides consisting of 2-3 amino acids. These then enter the bloodstream and accumulate in joint cartilage (along with the skin, bones and other collagen-rich tissues.)"

Evidence:"However, since I was dubious that cellphone radiation could cause cancer, I immersed myself in the literature regarding the biological effects of low-intensity microwave radiation, emitted by cellphones and other wireless devices. After reading many animal toxicology studies that found that this radiation could increase oxidative stress — free radicals, stress proteins and DNA damage — I became increasingly convinced that what we were observing in our review of human studies was indeed a real risk. While Myung and his colleagues were visiting the Center for Family and Community Health, you reviewed case-control studies examining the association between mobile phone use and tumor risk. What did you find? Our 2009 review, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found that heavy cellphone use was associated with increased brain cancer incidence, especially in studies that used higher quality methods and studies that had no telecommunications industry funding. Last year, we updated our review, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, based on a meta-analysis of 46 case-control studies — twice as many studies as we used for our 2009 review — and obtained similar findings."

Not everyone bitten by a mosquito carrying a virus will develop symptoms. New research suggests the worse our reactions to mosquito bites, the more likely it is we’ll get sick. The scientists allowed the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, to bite laboratory mice and then injected the mice with Semliki Forest virus (an African mosquito-borne virus that generally causes mild symptoms in humans) via syringe. Other mice were only injected with the virus. What they found was that the immune cells that rushed to the bite site as part of an inflammatory response helped the virus replicate and spread. Mice without mosquito bites had substantially lower rates of infection."

Evidence:"Those eating grapes and raisins had a 12% reduced risk and apples and pears cut the chances by 7%. Prunes also had a protective effect, giving an 11% drop in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Other fruits such as bananas, plums, peaches and apricots had a negligible impact but drinking fruit juice increased the risk by 8%, according to the study.People who replaced all fruit juice with eating whole fruits could expect a 7% drop in their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.For individual fruits, replacing three servings a week of fruit juice with blueberries cut the risk by 33% while replacing juice with grapes and raisins cut the risk by 19%. The risk was also 14% lower if juice was replaced with apples and pears, 13% lower if replaced with bananas and 12% lower if replaced with grapefruit.The research, published in the British Medical Journal, includes data on 187,382 people taken from three separate studies, of whom 12,198 developed type 2 diabetes.Food questionnaires were used every four years to assess diet and asked how often, on average, people consumed each food in a standard portion size.The relatively high glycaemic load of fruit juice along with "reduced levels of beneficial nutrients through juicing processes" may explain why juice increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest. "Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits," they said.More research was needed, they added, but concluded: "Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk. "About 2.7 million people in the UK are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and a further 850,000 are thought to have it but not know."

Evidence:"His findings showed that sit-ups and crunches weren’t just mediocre strength-building moves; they were actually hurting lots of people. “If you bend the spine forward over and over again when not under load, not much happens to the spine,” McGill told me. He gave the example of belly dancers, whose movements he has studied: They flex their spines repetitively without high incidence of injury. “The problem occurs when you flex over and over again with load from higher muscle activation or external objects held in the hands.”If you’ve ever been told to lift with your legs, this is why. When a person’s spine curves and strains in order to move weight through space—like when a bunch of third graders flail through a set of sit-ups—the movement stresses their spinal disks. The more often you ask your spine to flex in those circumstances, the riskier it is."

   Is it possible to drink too much water? In short, yes: There is such a thing as drinking too much water—but why is that bad? "Kidneys can excrete up to 28 liters of fluid in a day, but only one liter an hour," says Christina Lang, MD, internal medicine and pediatric physician at UCHealth in Fort Collins. "Drinking more than this can lead to water intoxication and electrolyte imbalances." According to Natasha Trentacosta, MD, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, overhydration is often seen in athletes if they drink an excessive amount of water. Doing so can dilute the sodium in their bodies, resulting in a condition called hyponatremia."

Evidence:"HIV cannot be spread from one person to another in any of the following ways:
Casual contact
In studies of hundreds of households in which families have lived with and cared for people who have AIDS, including situations in which no one knew that the person was HIV-infected, HIV was spread only when there was sexual contact or needle-sharing with the infected person or contact with the infected person's blood. HIV is not spread in such settings where exposures are repeated and prolonged and can involve contact with an infected person's body fluids, so it is even less likely to be spread in other casual social settings, such as schools and offices. Saliva, sweat, tears, urine, or feces
HIV cannot be spread by sharing drinking glasses or by casual kissing. The risk of spreading the virus through "deep" kissing in which large amounts of saliva are exchanged is extremely low. Only one unproven case has ever been reported. No cases of HIV spread have ever been reported after a person has come in contact with the sweat, tears, urine, or feces of an HIV-infected person."

Evidence:"Several case reports and case series have suggested a potential association between statins and cognitive impairment [2].With the increased diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, the prescription of statins has also increased. Because cholesterol is heavily implicated as a causative factor in the formation of amyloid plaques, a reduction in cholesterol formation is postulated to slow plaque formation [3]. Statins are also reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. There are several studies and meta-analyses [3] confirming the benefits of statin use on cognitive impairment.Within the population receiving statins, there is a high proportion with memory loss and associated cognitive symptoms owing to the strong correlation of vascular risk factors, like diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, with vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia. Statins are used to control vascular risk factors that may contribute to dementia, and there is emerging evidence that statins may play a protective role in improving memory problems in dementia [4, 5]. However, there is also increasing concern that statins may be a causative factor for cognitive problems, mainly memory problems [2], although this has not yet been reported as a side effect in the British National Formulary.The postulation that statins can cause cognitive decline is based on the fact that lipophilic statins like atorvastatin and simvastatin show increased crossing of the blood–brain barrier compared to hydrophilic statins (for example, pravastatin and rosuvastatin)."

Evidence:"However in trials that tested vitamin C after cold symptoms occurred, there was some evidence that a large dose produced greater benefits than lower doses. Reviewer's conclusions:
      Long term daily supplementation with vitamin C in large doses daily does not appear to prevent colds. There appears to be a modest benefit in reducing duration of cold symptoms from ingestion of relatively high doses of vitamin C. The relation of dose to therapeutic benefit needs further exploration.

The study further found that such processed meats as bacon or sausage posed an even bigger risk of colorectal cancer than consuming red meat."

 Hemorrhoid Diet 
Hemorrhoid Diet
Eating a balanced diet, rich in fiber, is one of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make for your hemorrhoids. A balanced, high-fiber diet, together with plenty of fluids, softens the stool and increases its bulk, which will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids or worsen symptoms from existing hemorrhoids. Always check with your healthcare provider before starting any diet or exercise plan. How Fiber Helps Prevent Constipation
A balanced diet with plenty of fiber and water softens stools and make them easier to pass. This reduces pressure on hemorrhoids."

Evidence:"Even in small amounts, vaping liquid containing nicotine can be very harmful if:
swallowed
absorbed through the skin
There have been fatalities as well as non-fatal nicotine poisoning caused by children swallowing vaping liquid. When buying a container of vaping liquid with nicotine, look for one that has a child-resistant closure and a 'poison' hazard symbol. The closure and symbol are required by law. They help protect children in three ways:
The closure makes it harder for a child to gain access to the liquid in the container. The poison hazard symbol reminds parents and caregivers to keep the product out of sight and reach of children. Children are taught that the hazard symbol means Danger!"

Evidence:"“We have animal studies suggesting even low-level exposures to the kind of radio wave radiation associated with Wi-Fi could have a variety of negative health effects,” says Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California, Berkeley. (Moskowitz has collected much of that research here.) He mentions neurodevelopmental issues, cancer, and reproductive harm—in both men and women—as some of those potential health concerns, especially for pregnant women and young children. The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified mobile phones as a “possible carcinogen,” which means there’s currently not enough research to say whether either causes cancer. Earlier this year, a rodent study found heavy exposures to cell phone radiation increased rats’ risks for some brain and heart tumors. More rodent research has tied high levels of Wi-Fi and cell exposure to hormonal shifts and oxidative stress—the kind of shifts that could promote cancer or brain diseases."

Evidence:""And the assumption is being made that there is more oral-genital contact among young people with HSV-1." However, the researchers cannot be certain if kissing, oral sex, or intercourse transmitted the infections. Kissing or even touching the lips of someone with an active cold sore caused by HSV-1 can lead to genital herpes if you then touch your own genitalia.Half of all American high school students are sexually active, according to federal statistics. This includes more than 60% of boys and girls in 12th grade, and 33% of girls and 45% of boys in 9th grade. Of those, only about half of the seniors and two-thirds of 9th graders use condoms, which can prevent the spread of genital herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases, according to the CDC. Once infected with either form of herpes, the virus typically lies dormant in nerves and occasionally breaks out into highly contagious sores that cause burning, itching, redness, and ulcers in the infected area."
Question:Can a cold sore cause genital herpes?
