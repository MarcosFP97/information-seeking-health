Evidence:"The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. Deaths from any cause
        We do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID-19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID-19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID-19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Many studies point to the beneficial effect of vitamin D on the immune system, especially regarding protection against infections. In developing their prophylactic COVID-19 protocol, the EVMS researchers noted that U.S. patients with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to be hospitalized. They also observed that nations with low average levels of vitamin D were more likely to experience serious outbreaks and higher mortality rates. EVMS included vitamin C in their protocol because it’s a potent antioxidant that’s critical to the immune-cell function. They cite a large-scale study of more than 11,000 patients showing that vitamin C reduces the risk of contracting colds. They also cite research showing that vitamin C reduced the symptoms of colds, about 25% of which are caused by other coronaviruses."

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Study to Help Prevent COVID-19
Home
COVID-19
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a contagious virus affecting everyone. Researchers at Texas A&M University, in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College Medicine and Cedars Sinai Medical Center, are looking for health care workers, first responders, front line workers, seniors and those with preexisting health conditions to participate in a study evaluating the Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a booster of the immune response and to study if this vaccine reduces illness severity from coronavirus. The study will also examine if BGC will improve efficacy of recent vaccines.The goal of this trial is to learn if a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, a nearly 100-year-old commonly used tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, can help prevent COVID-19 infection and/or mitigate the severity of the illness compared to a placebo. Vaccine Trial Eligibility and Consent
To participate, volunteers must be:
At least 18 years old
Personnel working at a hospital, medical center or clinic, including medical, veterinary, dental and ophthalmology; first responders such as law enforcement, firefighters or paramedics; front line workers such as a teachers, wait staff, grocery store workers; or high risk individuals such as the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions
Able to use their own device to provide data electronically (e.g. via smartphone or tablet)
Able to participate for at least six months
If you would like to participate, consent will be collected electronically and by phone in adherence with current physical distancing practices."

PARIS (AFP) — Taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen does not increase the risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 or of dying from it, according to a new study, the largest so far on this class of medicines. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. But observational research published Saturday in the medical journal Lancet Rheumatology, based on 72,000 hospitalized patients, found that the drugs “do not increase the mortality or severity” of COVID-19. The authors recommended that doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs as they have in the past. “When the pandemic began over a year ago, we needed to be sure that these common medications would not lead to worse outcomes in people with COVID-19,” lead author Ewen Harrison, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said in a press release."

Thus, it is easy to dislodge the virus through gargling and nasal irrigation by salt water. However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help.A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore.They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a "compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation. This method is simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategy with therapeutic and prophylactic value".According to the researchers, the common salt (sodium chloride) present in saline water inhibits replication of a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus."

Evidence:"That was where their relationship with reality came to an end.Several strains of the theory have emerged. One is that 5G weakens immune systems, another that it inhibits oxygen intake, exacerbating the disease, a third that covid-19 does not exist but is a cover for 5G-related diseases that governments are trying to hush up. Amanda Holden, a TV personality, tweeted a (now-deleted) petition linking 5G with coronavirus. On April 7th, YouTube removed an interview with David Icke, a conspiracy theorist, repeating the story, and said it would ban all such content.The theories have spread like wildfire in Africa, America and Europe, says Hanna Linderstal of Earhart, a security and risk-management firm, with Europeans the most enthusiastic proponents. Last week, they led to literal fires: mobile networks’ tower masts were set alight in Birmingham and Merseyside. Workers laying fibre-optic cable have been harassed in the street.Ms Linderstal analysed dozens of videos on social-media platforms."

Over the Counter: Take tea time seriously during COVID-19 pandemicGary Kracoff and John Walczyk
 |  Daily News CorrespondentsAn estimated 159 million Americans regularly drink tea, and according to the Tea Association, in 2020 we downed more than 3.8 billion gallons of it – primarily iced and black. While that may sound like a lot, when averaged over our population, we lag behind many countries including Turkey, the United Kingdom and China.Part of the reason some cultures around the globe have consumed tea for nearly five millennia has been to take advantage of its health benefits. Fast forward to 2021 and tea’s ability to support our immune system amid the COVID-19 pandemic is as important as ever.Traditional teas like black, green and oolong are full of polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), naturally occurring organic compounds that have a potent antioxidant effect on our bodies and therefore may reduce chances of heart disease and cancer. EGCG and the amino acid L-theanine both pack an immune-boosting punch. To get the most antioxidant bang for your buck, avoid adding milk or cream because their proteins may inhibit some polyphenols.Depending on variety, the amount of time and the temperature in which tea leaves are steeped will impact antioxidant levels. White tea should be steeped longer in hot water while black tea is best steeped for a short amount of time in very hot water."

AbstractThe efficacy of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset (NCT04348656). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were similar in women with and without severe COVID-19. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulated hormone signaling pathways in CD14+CD16− (ie, classical) monocytes and CD14−CD16+ (ie, nonclassical) monocytes in male patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care unit treatment vs those who did not.Conclusions and Relevance 
    In this single-center cohort study of patients with COVID-19, lower testosterone concentrations during hospitalization were associated with increased disease severity and inflammation in men. Hormone signaling pathways in monocytes did not parallel serum hormone concentrations, and further investigation is required to understand their pathophysiologic association with COVID-19. Introduction
Coronaviral diseases have constituted a major public health issue during the last 2 decades, starting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic in 2002 through 2003,1 continuing with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012,2 and most recently, the current COVID-19 pandemic. With a unique combination of transmissibility and lethality, COVID-19 has had a dramatic public health impact. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are more likely to be men than women.3 This sexual dimorphism has led some to presume that the male sex hormone, testosterone, may be a risk factor associated with the severity of COVID-19 and that estrogen may be protective.4 However, testosterone concentrations are highly variable among men and affected by biological variables and pathologic stressors.5,6 
Testosterone concentrations in men decline continuously by 1% to 2% per year starting after age 30 years.7-9 In addition, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and many chronic illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency, and chronic lung disease, are associated with lower serum testosterone concentrations in men.5,10,11 Thus, the severity of COVID-19 illness seems to coincide with the nadir of lifetime testosterone, and the comorbidities that predispose individuals to increased COVID-19 severity are also associated with lower testosterone concentrations."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Common symptoms can include:
– Fever
– Cough
– Shortness of breath
– Upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Managing Fever
Do not use NSAIDS (Advil, Motrin, Ibuprofen, or Aleve) to manage fever or pain. Instead, use acetaminophen (Tylenol). Current research indicates that using NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen, can extend or worsen COVID-19 symptoms. Managing Cough and Shortness of Breath
Over-the-counter medications used for upper respiratory infections may help alleviate symptoms. Those medications include guaifenesin (Mucinex), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), and dextromethorphan (Robitussin, Delsym). Some medications include multiple drugs; contact your physician if you plan to take more than one medication to manage your symptoms."

Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"COVID-19 usually spreads by droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking. The best available scientific evidence is that, when used correctly, wearing a face covering may reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets in certain circumstances. Although they may not prevent you from becoming infected with the virus, face coverings help prevent you from spreading it to others if you are unaware you are infected (some people don’t have any symptoms, especially early in the infection). Because face coverings are mainly intended to protect others, not the wearer, from COVID-19, they’re not a replacement for social distancing and regular hand washing. It’s important to follow all the other government advice on COVID-19 including taking steps to stay safe and help prevent the spread. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for others and playing your part to prevent transmission of the virus."

So, for the avoidance of doubt, let us be clear: apple cider vinegar does not kill coronavirus. And using it to wash your hands is a waste of time, too. Just stick to soap.

A new type of ultraviolet light that may be safe for people took less than five minutes to reduce the level of indoor airborne microbes by more than 98%, a joint study by scientists at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and in the U.K. has found. Even as microbes continued to be sprayed into the room, the level remained very low as long as the lights were on. The study suggests that far-UVC light from lamps installed in the ceiling could be a highly effective passive technology for reducing person-to-person transmission of airborne-mediated diseases such as COVID and influenza indoors, and lowering the risk of the next pandemic. “Far-UVC rapidly reduces the amount of active microbes in the indoor air to almost zero, making indoor air essentially as safe as outdoor air,” says David Brenner, PhD, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and co-author of the study. “Using this technology in locations where people gather together indoors could prevent the next potential pandemic.”
The study was published March 23 in the journal Scientific Reports, a Nature journal."

Evidence:"Top on the list is that a combination of honey and black seed helped with symptoms alleviation and viral clearance and reduced mortality in patients with moderate and severe coronavirus disease. Also, studies have shown that gargling with green tea extracts, or plant juices can lower flu infections and viral symptoms. Similarly, chokeberry or pomegranate juices could be used against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, in addition to teas. Researchers also found that lemon juice and palm oil extract could prevent and treat liver damage from excessive alcohol consumption even as chili pepper could reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 26 per cent. Meanwhile, German researchers have established the association between severe respiratory infection caused by SARS CoV-2 and factors such as age, body mass index (BMI) and ABO blood group. Also, Nigerian researchers at an online event to celebrate the 11th anniversary of HerbFEST (a herb and natural expo), on Tuesday, November 10, 2020, brainstormed on herbal medicine and dietary supplements for the treatment of COVID-19."

Evidence:"Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of oseltamivir against COVID-19. METHODS: Swiss-model was used to construct the structure of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NRBD) of the nucleoprotein (NC), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). TM-align program was performed to compare the structure of the viral proteins with the structure of the neuraminidase of influenza A. Molecular docking was used to analyze the theoretical possibility of effective binding of oseltamivir with the active centers of the viral proteins. In vitro study was used to evaluate the antiviral efficiency of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2. By clinical case analysis, we statistically evaluated whether the history of oseltamivir use influenced the progression of the disease."

Evidence:"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are recommended to disinfect hands and surfaces, but drinking or ingesting alcohol is in no way recommended. In fact, alcohol consumption could worsen COVID-19 symptoms and could weaken your body's ability to fight the virus, if you have lowered immunity. Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor for many diseases, and alcohol should only be consumed in moderation, if at all. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that drinking alcohol will not protect against infection or illness from COVID-19. In fact, alcohol consumption can reduce the immune system's ability to fight infection and increase the chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, alcohol consumption has other negative health consequences (ex."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This process would explain the proposed protective effect of ARBs against SARS-CoV-1–induced lung injury in mice.2Additionally, although absence of ACE2 (in knockout mice) protects against infection, it is not clear whether partial reduction of ACE2 levels, achieved through withdrawal of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, would have clinically relevant benefits.As there are quite a few similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, particularly in terms of protein binding to ACE2, it is likely that the above findings will also be applicable to the current situation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).4,5We therefore believe that the views expressed by O’Mara1 should be treated as simple reflections and that caution should be exercised when considering their clinical applicability. The relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, and, by analogy, SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in the context of COVID-19, is highly complex. In fact, basic research suggests that ACE inhibitors, and ARBs in particular, have a protective role.In this context, thus, there is no basis for discontinuing existing treatments with ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Moreover, complications due to the indiscriminate discontinuation of these drugs could have far more serious consequences than many of the surmised adverse effects. O’Mara.Could ACE inhibitors, and particularly ARBs, increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection., (Marzo 2020), [2]Y. Imai, K. Kuba, S.

The new coronavirus has proven deadly, but it can also be defeated with something as simple as soap suds. In this animation, Health Matters explains how handwashing with soap kills the coronavirus and why it’s the best defense against the spread of COVID-19. “Soap molecules disrupt the fatty layer or coat surrounding the virus, ” says Dr. David Goldberg, an internist and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Westchester and an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “Once the viral coat is broken down, the virus is no longer able to function.”
The best way to protect yourself from the coronavirus remains avoiding exposure — and helping to prevent its spread. That’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages social distancing, wearing a face mask in public places, and, of course, handwashing with soap."

Evidence:"Our findings suggest that nicotine might not have a protective role in the risk of COVID-19 as previously hypothesized. IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly worldwide. By October 3, 2022, there were more than 618 million confirmed SARS-COV-2 cases and more than 6.5 million deaths attributable to COVID-191. Researchers have explored potential risk factors to identify patients at high risk of infection or death, as well as for targeting pharmaceutical and preventive interventions2.Tobacco use, as a leading risk factor of death and disability due to respiratory diseases, was expected to increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progression and deaths3,4. Smokers have generally increased risk of other respiratory infections and could be expected to have higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 due to repetitive hand-to-mouth handlings, increased mask handlings5, sharing of cigarettes and vape devices6 and creation of aerosols which might be carriers of viruses. On the other hand, smokers might have fewer social contacts7 and be less exposed to indoor places8."

FDA: Hydroxychloroquine will not prevent COVID-19Despite President Trump's thoughts, drug and disease experts seem to agree that hydroxychloroquine is not a proven preventative measure for COVID-19.USA TODAYUpdate: In June, the authors of the study below asked that it be retracted, saying they were no longer confident in its findings. Other studies have raised questions about using the drug against COVID-19. While many U.S. hospitals used hydroxychloroquine early in the outbreak, they have since moved away from the drug. Original article:A new study shows coronavirus patients who took hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 had a higher risk of death than those who weren't given the drug. The study, published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet, also found that COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop serious heart arrhythmias if treated with hydroxychloroquine, or its closely related cousin chloroquine. Arrhythmias can lead to a sudden cardiac death, the report said, but researchers did not associate the study’s fatalities with adverse cardiac affects.Even though it’s only an observational study – not the gold standard double-blind, randomized, controlled trials – experts say the enormous sample size makes it compelling.The study comprises of 96,000 coronavirus patients from six different countries who were hospitalized between Dec. 20, 2019 and April 14, 2020."

Abstract
Following the recovery from an initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, a recent meta-analysis of almost 1 million patients worldwide suggested that an estimated 43% of patients had experienced a variety of sequelae [1]. Furthermore, numerous studies indicate that patients can develop somatic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, dermatologic, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal manifestations that are heterogeneous and vary in intensity and duration (for up to 12 months) [2,3]. The CDC has defined this phenomenon as “long-term symptoms that might be experienced weeks to months after primary infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 [4]” and proposed designations for this syndrome have included long covid, long chronic covid syndrome, chronic covid, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute covid-19 syndrome and long – haulers [5]."

Evidence:"In a phase 3 trial, remestemcel-L was found useful in treating acute graft versus host disease, which Mesoblast claims produces a similar cytokine storm process as seen in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additionally, post hoc analysis of a previous study involving 60 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary demonstrated remestemcel-L “significantly improved” respiratory function in patients with the same elevated inflammatory biomarkers that are also seen in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome
COVID-19 patients most at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome include the elderly and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes. According to Mesoblast, patients with COVID-19 that have developed acute respiratory distress syndrome have an almost 50% fatality rate. Remestemcel-L is an allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell product, with preliminary data from China indicating allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have either cured or “significantly improved” functional outcomes for seven patients with COVID-19 in the small trial. By mid-morning trade, Mesoblast’s shares were up almost 30% to $1.74."

37

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ribavirin could reduce lung involvement indirectly through reduction of viral replication and local shedding. This could reduce viral exposure to alveolar dendritic cells and T lymphocytes, thereby limiting the inflammatory cascade mediated by cytokines and chemokines, which is the main mechanism of alveolar damage and alteration in respiratory exchange. None of the five patients included in this case series required admission to an intensive care unit, and the effectiveness of ribavirin aerosol for severe presentations of COVID-19 is unclear. However, the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study support the feasibility and efficacy of using ribavirin aerosol treatment in infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection [24]. Potential advantages with ribavirin aerosol treatment for patients with COVID-19 versus oral or intravenous formulations include direct targeting of medication to the site of infection and a lower risk for adverse events that are associated with systemic administration. However, there are concerns about using an aerosol treatment in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of increased risk of healthcare providers being exposed to the virus."
