Does collagen taken as a supplement help with arthritis? I'm seeing it in products for joint health. Written by Tod Cooperman, M.D. Last Updated: 10/08/2019
                            Initially Posted: 07/31/2014
Answer:
Collagen hydrolysate (enzymatically hydrolyzed collagen or collagen peptide) may help reduce the pain of osteoarthritis (worn joints) according to some preliminary studies. There is also evidence that a branded collagen that has not been hydrolyzed, UC-II, may be helpful. For details, see the Joint Pain section of the Collagen Supplements Review, which includes our tests of products containing UC-II and other collagen ingredients, and our Top Picks for collagen supplements for joints."

Evidence:"Photograph: VOISIN/Getty Images/CanopyMark Hertsgaard and Mark DowieSat 14 Jul 2018 15.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 23 Jul 2018 12.48 BSTOn 28 March this year, the scientific peer review of a landmark United States government study concluded that there is “clear evidence” that radiation from mobile phones causes cancer, specifically, a heart tissue cancer in rats that is too rare to be explained as random occurrence.Eleven independent scientists spent three days at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, discussing the study, which was done by the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services and ranks among the largest conducted of the health effects of mobile phone radiation. NTP scientists had exposed thousands of rats and mice (whose biological similarities to humans make them useful indicators of human health risks) to doses of radiation equivalent to an average mobile user’s lifetime exposure.The peer review scientists repeatedly upgraded the confidence levels the NTP’s scientists and staff had attached to the study, fuelling critics’ suspicions that the NTP’s leadership had tried to downplay the findings. Thus the peer review also found “some evidence” – one step below “clear evidence” – of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands.Not one major news organisation in the US or Europe reported this scientific news. But then, news coverage of mobile phone safety has long reflected the outlook of the wireless industry. For a quarter of a century now, the industry has been orchestrating a global PR campaign aimed at misleading not only journalists, but also consumers and policymakers about the actual science concerning mobile phone radiation. Indeed, big wireless has borrowed the very same strategy and tactics big tobacco and big oil pioneered to deceive the public about the risks of smoking and climate change, respectively."

Evidence:"Hanan Abumanhal del Technion (Technion)
Baking soda, the simple household product familiar to everybody, may revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer, researchers at Israel’s Technion Institute have discovered. A graduate research student at the Technion Institute has found a revolutionary solution for the treatment of breast cancer, showing that sodium bicarbonate – baking soda – can increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment because this natural substance changes the acidity of the cancerous tumor and thus increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy. “Many studies show and emphasize the importance of the environment of the tumor in supporting cancer cells and the ability of the cells to penetrate nearby tissues and send metastases to other organs of the body,” explained Dr. Hanan Abumanhal, a resident of northern Israel who got her PhD degree last week at the prestigious institution. Dr. Abumanhal knew that environmental changes in the cancerous tumor tissue can affect the response of cells to treatments and encourage the development of resistance to anti-cancer treatment. “That is why it is important to develop a synergistic treatment that changes the entire environmental balance and thus ‘suffocate’ the tumor,” she explained. Dr. Abumanhal focused on a particularly aggressive version of breast cancer, a version created from a combination of mutations and therefore relatively resistant to existing treatments."

Evidence:"problems in reading and writing)
spatial disorientation (uncertainty concerning the left and right)
disorders in fine motor skills that manifest themselves in handwriting
disturbances in speech (ranging from stammering through stuttering)
These primary consequences can then transform into various differing secondary consequences:
inferiority complexes
insecurity
introversion
overcompensation through heightened performance
contrariness; an oppositional and provocational manner; (e.g. the class clown in school; and the persistent, compulsive wise-cracker in adulthood)
various distinctive disorders in behavior
bedwetting and nail-biting
emotional problems lasting into adulthood with neurotic and/or psycho-somatic symptomology
disorders in the personality profile
Of course, all of the primary and secondary difficulties listed above could also appear without the converting of handedness and they are just as prevalent in left-handers as in right-handers. However, as has been found in practice, through the additional converting of handedness these difficulties, are incalculably increased. Thus, the converting of handedness negatively intervenes into and inhibits the course of the cerebral processes. It drives people to continually use more energy to mobilize their intelligence than left-handed or right-handed people who have not been disabled by the consequences of converting would find necessary. The level of intelligence itself is not diminished."

Evidence:"But that’s not the case for everyone. For some, marijuana use poses a substantial likelihood of developing an addiction.The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently released data that suggests that 30 percent of those who use marijuana may have some degree of “marijuana use disorder.”They add that people who use marijuana before age 18 are 4 to 7 times more likely to develop this use disorder than adults.Researchers estimated that 4 million people in the United States met the criteria for marijuana use disorder in 2015. Of them, 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment.The use disorder, according to researchers, can morph into an addiction when the person can’t stop using the drug even when it interferes with their daily activities.The Canyon, a treatment center in Malibu, California, lists 10 signs that someone might have an addiction to marijuana. Among the signals is a growing tolerance for the drug’s effects, as well as using more marijuana than they initially intended to use.Who becomes addicted to marijuana and why?Genes are one strong predictor of developing an addiction, said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California.Studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory. They have higher rates of an addiction co-occurring, which means that if one of them develops an addiction, the other is at greater risk for developing one, than fraternal twins raised apart.But family ties may also help some people avoid progressing to a state of addiction.“When we look at the criteria for addiction, it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior,” explained Carl Hart, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York and author of “High Price,” in a 2016 interview with Healthline. “It has a lot to do with responsibility skills… It’s not perfect, but when you look at the people who are addicted, and you look at people who have jobs and families, they have responsibilities, they’re plugged into their societies, they have a social network, the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs, families, social networks.”Those who don’t become addicted also tend to have more options.“Most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good,” said Gantt Galloway, PharmD, executive and research director of the New Leaf Treatment Center and senior scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, in a 2016 interview with Healthline.“Those who have fewer choices, who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships… those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction.”Mental health conditions, which have both genetic and environmental causes play a large one in a person’s chance of developing an addiction.“Mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction,” said Stalcup."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the World Health Organization, deemed processed meat carcinogenic. Research data suggested the colorectal cancer risk increased by 18% for someone who ate about 2 ounces of processed meat daily — think a couple of salami slices. A 2021 study from Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health found that these meats can damage DNA, leaving what the researchers called a “mutational signature.”
There are several possible reasons for this relationship between meat and colon cancer. It’s been suggested that grilling red meat over high heat can produce carcinogenic compounds. With processed meats, the nitrates and other preservatives used in, say, ham or bologna deli meats, may be responsible. We are still trying to pinpoint the exact cause, so this is an important area of evolving scientific research."
