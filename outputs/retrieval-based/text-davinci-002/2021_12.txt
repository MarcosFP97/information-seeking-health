Evidence:"Anyone who has problems with plantar fasciitis, tendonitis, or previous ankle joint injuries may find it helpful to wear a brace. Experts believe it is best to wear an ankle brace after an injury, rather than beforehand, as a preventive measure. Constant use of an ankle brace can actually cause more harm than good, as it may prevent the surrounding muscles from gaining strength. Using a brace on occasion, say for a hike on uneven terrain or when playing a sport with a lot of lateral movement, is recommended. After an injury, a good ankle brace should provide support and stability during the healing process."
Question:Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis? The answer must be yes or no.

And if it’s in the form of soup, it also fits with the familiar advice from doctors about staying hydrated.AdvertisementIn fact, there’s some evidence that feeding a cold might have another, even more direct, benefit. In 2002, researchers at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam reported that eating helps the immune system’s ability to fight viruses, which cause colds. They found that levels of interferon gamma, a protein involved in the body’s infection-fighting system, quadrupled after a meal.In contrast, avoiding food actually lowered interferon gamma levels. At least, that’s what this study found, but it only involved six participants, and – perhaps surprisingly – has never been properly followed up."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"An Ankle Brace Can Help to Regain Range of Motion
What This Does
Increasing range of motion in a sprained ankle helps avoid the buildup of scar-tissue. Preventing scar tissue reduced pain and decreases the likelihood of developing lingering problems and recurring injuries. How To Do It
Ankle exercises prescribed by a medical professional, such as movements with resistance bands and balls, will increase flexibility and strength in the ankle. A flexible ankle brace for sprains provides increased range of movement, reduces the risk of overuse and provides support for the weak ligaments and joint. How Long It Takes
The length of step two depends on the severity of the injury and can take between two weeks and several months. This ensures a gradual increase in the range of motion of the injured ankle and makes certain that scar tissue is held at bay."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Though they’re not the star player, vitamins may play a role in your scar-fading skin care routine. The Vitamin E Question
Age-old home remedies and skin care products have touted vitamin E‘s scar- and blemish-fading ability for decades, but the jury is still out in terms of its effectiveness. Numerous studies have found that topical vitamin E application does not fade scars, though some tests have shown that it does prevent extra scar tissue from forming over the wound and that ingesting the vitamin—which you can do by upping your intake of leafy greens, seeds and nuts—may bolster the healing process by encouraging red blood cell formation. Tretinoin Treatment
In the case of sun spots, also known as liver spots, the prescription vitamin A cream called tretinoin reduces their appearance. Applied as a topical cream, tretinoin, lightens hyperpigmentation of the skin and can promote collagen production. Vitamin A and its derivatives other than tretinoin show up in all sorts of non-prescription, off-the-shelf beauty products, such as gels, emollient creams and collagen-boosting serums."

This medicine is authorised for use in the European Union. Overview
Dupixent is a medicine used to treat patients aged 12 years or over with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema, when the skin is itchy, red and dry) when treatments applied to the skin are not sufficient or appropriate. Patients from 6 up to 12 years of age can also be given the medicine if their condition is severe.Dupixent may be added to maintenance treatment for severe asthma in patients aged 6 years or more, whose asthma is not properly controlled by appropriate combination therapy (high-dose corticosteroids over 12 years of age, medium-to-high dose in those younger, taken by inhalation, plus another medicine used for the prevention of asthma). Dupixent is only for use in patients with a type of inflammation of the airways called ‘type 2 inflammation’.Dupixent can also be added to local treatment with corticosteroids for adults who have inflammation of the nose and sinuses together with growths (polyps) obstructing the airways in the nose (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis). It is used when other treatments have not worked well enough.Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab."

Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults 
Bottom line
The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was useful for treating migraine attacks in the studies we found. It was not a lot better than using sumatriptan alone, but it was much better than using naproxen alone. Attacks were more successfully treated when medication was taken early, when pain was mild.

Evidence:"However, the overall quality of studies was low (11).In the same review, the supplement was not found to improve joint mobility or function compared with a placebo (11).Glucosamine and chondroitin togetherThough the two can be taken separately, glucosamine and chondroitin are commonly taken as a single supplement. This combination has been more extensively studied.A 2015 2-year double-blind, randomized study showed no differences in pain or joint space narrowing — a sign of cartilage deterioration — after taking either 1,500 mg/day of glucosamine sulfate, 800 mg/day of chondroitin sulfate, a combination of both, or a placebo (12).Similar results were observed in a 2018 analysis, where combined glucosamine and chondroitin didn’t significantly improve pain or stiffness. Meanwhile, chondroitin alone led to minor improvements in pain (13).On the other hand, another 2018 analysis observed a significant improvement in pain scores when glucosamine and chondroitin were taken together, while no improvements were found when the supplements were taken separately (14).Similarly, a 2015 sponsored study showed that combining 1,500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride with 1,200 mg of chondroitin sulfate effectively reduced knee osteoarthritis pain, stiffness, and swelling compared with 200 mg of the osteoarthritis NSAID celecoxib (15).Another 2015 study also found that combined glucosamine and chondroitin supplements were comparably effective as celecoxib (16).Ultimately, no firm conclusions can be made on the effectiveness of glucosamine, chondroitin, or the two combined as a treatment for osteoarthritic pain or stiffness. Due to the large inconsistency in results and quality of available research, continued research is needed.SummaryTaken together or individually, both glucosamine and chondroitin may provide minor relief from osteoarthritis pain. However, not all studies have shown them to be beneficial, and more research is needed.Risks and side effectsMost studies have shown that both glucosamine and chondroitin are safe to use for most people and no serious side effects have been reported. Only mild side effects like stomach upset, nausea, and headache have been observed (13, 17).However, keep in mind that glucosamine is commonly derived from chitin — a compound found in shellfish."

"For croup, go in the bathroom with the door shut and turn the shower on hot, let the room get really, really steamy an sit in there with the shower going for 20 minutes or so. This helped our daughter. If it gets worse, you can get an oral steroid medication from the pediatrician -- it does not solve the problem immediately but apparently can give relief.

Evidence:"Benefits of Minoxidil for Hair  
Liz deSousa for BYRDIE
No matter how minoxidil works, one thing's for certain: It can greatly benefit those with thinning hair and/or hair loss:
Stimulates hair growth: "Minoxidil is a topical medication that is applied to the scalp to stimulate new hair growth in those experiencing hair loss,” explains Samantha Fisher, MD, a Florida-based dermatologist. Increases hair thickness and density: In addition to stimulating hair growth and quelling a receding hairline, “Minoxidil can increase the density and thickness of hair,” says Fisher. In other words, strands grow back fuller and healthier. Treats hair disorders: Minoxidil is shown to be effective in promoting hair regrowth and density in patients with Androgenetic alopecia and female pattern hair loss. Hair Type Considerations  
 Hers
Generally speaking, minoxidil is safe for all hair types, including natural hair, although those with color-treated hair may experience more irritation. Minoxidil may be less effective on certain types of hair loss, such as forms of scarring alopecia that are more common among Black women."

Evidence:"ConclusionsStress-related symptom (i.e., depression, anxiety-trait, and sleep) scores decreased and cognitive function (i.e., verbal fluency and executive function) scores improved after four weeks of L-theanine administration. The reduction in sleep quality problems (disturbances in sleep latency, sleep disturbance, and use of sleep medication) was greater in the L-theanine administration compared to the placebo administration, while verbal fluency, especially letter fluency, was improved in the L-theanine administration among individuals who showed relatively low performance at pretreatment. Moreover, L-theanine administration was safe and well complied with. Therefore, L-theanine may be a suitable nutraceutical ingredient for improving mental conditions in a healthy population.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Jun Ogura for anonymizing data to protect personal information.

Evidence:"Want to learn more about exercise and depression? Many studies show that people who exercise regularly benefit with a positive boost in mood and lower rates of depression.What Are the Psychological Benefits of Exercise With Depression?Improved self-esteem is a key psychological benefit of regular physical activity. These endorphins interact with the receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain.Endorphins also trigger a positive feeling in the body, similar to that of morphine. For example, the feeling that follows a run or workout is often described as "euphoric." That feeling, known as a "runner's high," can be accompanied by a positive and energizing outlook on life.Endorphins act as analgesics, which means they diminish the perception of pain."

Evidence:"In fact, the only time you would need to go to the doctor is if you got scratched and that scratch got infected. In very rare cases, the bone scratches the uvula, which then becomes red and inflamed. If this is the case, a course of antibiotics should quickly resolve the problem. The other scenario when a doctor visit may be necessary is described by Dr. Madsen: “If you're eating and you feel like something's stuck down lower in your esophagus and you feel fullness right at the base of your neck, right at the top of your sternum. If you are also unable to get food and water to stay down, it is possible a fishbone got lodged there and then food got backed up behind it.” If this is the case, it may be necessary to see a gastroenterologist to dislodge the bone and remove the obstruction. emergency

Evidence:"At the top of the list are vitamin C and zinc. But if you’ve ever tried these nutrients to speed up your own recovery time, you’ve likely wondered just how effective they really are. The truth is, vitamin C and zinc are not effective home remedies in treating a common cold. But the good news is consuming them will help you in other ways. “I believe that supplements such as vitamin C can help to boost your immune system, but we also have to be aware of risks of too much zinc or vitamin C and the side effects that can occur. As we saw during this pandemic, masks may be the future to help reduce viruses as well,” says Rina Chabra, DO, of Superior Family Medicine-UPMC."

Evidence:"For the question of what evidence there is for the health effects of copper bracelets, the scientists give a short answer. There is:
No good evidence that they reduce pain or inflammation
Fairly good evidence that they do not have any clinical effect. These conclusions come from the best data out there so far: a widely available scientific comparison of different copper and magnetic bracelets used by people with rheumatoid arthritis, published in 2013.1
This study was designed in such a way that, while it was not a large study, there were enough people taking part and wearing different kinds of bracelets that, should there have been even a minimal clinical improvement of 20 per cent in pain ratings, the study would have found it. There was not. The trial adds to a previous disappointment about the benefits of wearing metals in this way. A previous study looked at magnetic bracelets."

Bottom Line
Antibiotic associated diarrhea can be a frustrating and potentially economically disadvantageous adverse effect from antibiotic administration in children, with a reported incidence of around 5% (Wistrom 2001). Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence, as theoretically their ingestion will reduce the disturbanceof normal gut flora, thereby decreasing the incidence of diarrhea (Roberfroid 2010.). We reviewed three trials and one systematic review on this topic, and found that the reviewed studies for the most part demonstrated a reduced incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with probiotics, compared to those treated with placebo (or plain yogurt). PGY-2: Fox et al found improvements in both stool frequency and consistency, as well as a reduction in other adverse events (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting)."

Evidence:"It has little anti-inflammatory effect, though, which means it won’t do much for pain from inflammatory arthritis.Acetaminophen comes in many forms and strengths. The dose depends on both the form and strength of the product. How Tylenol worksAcetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is one of the most widely used pain relievers in the world. However, scientists don’t know exactly how it works to relieve pain. It is thought that this drug increases the body’s pain threshold so that pain is actually felt less.

no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The answer to our thesis question “Can Music Help Treat Depression?”  is simple:
“Yes.”
The Power of Music
One interesting thing about the meta-analysis we’re discussing is the broad, inclusive definition used by the study authors as to what constitutes music treatment. Most people have heard of Music Therapy, which is a specific type of therapy that uses music in a clinical setting to treat people with emotional or behavioral disorders. You can get an undergraduate or graduate degree in Music Therapy, then become a music therapist. But in this meta-analysis, music treatment included more than Music Therapy delivered by a degreed and licensed music therapist. Whereas Music Therapy is officially defined as follows:
“The clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.”
The authors of the meta-analysis defined music treatment as:
“Implementation of acoustic stimuli (“music”) as a medium for the purpose of improving symptoms in a defined group of participants (patients) suffering from depression.”
This is a big deal because it means music can help treat people with depression whether it’s delivered by a credentialed music therapist or not. The 43% reduction in depressive symptoms seen over all 28 studies and 1,810 included people who received official music therapy, people who listened to music passively, people who listened to music and then composed lyrics, people who played instruments, and people who played drums."
Question:Can music therapy help manage depression? The answer must be yes or no.

yes

Does the use of vitamin D improve asthma symptoms and reduce asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid treatment? Evidence-Based Answer
Despite the authors' caution that further data are needed to clarify the role of vitamin D in care, this Cochrane review found that its use reduces the average number of asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid treatment from 0.44 to 0.28 per person per year. It also decreases the risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbation from 6% per year to around 3% per year.1 (Strength of Recommendation: A, based on high-quality evidence.) Vitamin D has no effect on asthma symptom control as measured by the Asthma Control Test or on lung function as measured by predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).1 (Strength of Recommendation: A, based on high-quality evidence.)"
Question:Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There is no consistent evidence that breastfeeding is effective for the prevention of allergic disease. However, breastfeeding is recommended for the many benefits it provides to mother and infant. Breastfeeding during the period that solid foods are first introduced to infants from around six months may help reduce the risk of the infant developing allergies, although evidence for this is low. If breastfeeding is not possible, a standard cow's milk based formula can be given. There is no evidence that soy or goat's milk formula reduce the risk of allergic disease when used in preference to standard cow's milk based formula. Based on a recently published review of studies, there is no consistent convincing evidence to support a protective role for partially hydrolysed formulas (usually labelled 'HA' or Hypoallergenic) or extensively hydrolysed formulas for the prevention of eczema, food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis in infants or children."
Question:Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"Adding antioxidants to your diet and vitamin routine may increase semen parameters and reduce free radicals, leading to increased fertility outcomes. A Cochrane review of 50 clinical trials found low quality evidence that antioxidants may be associated with an increased live birth rate of around 25-40%. While the review couldn’t find associations for every antioxidant studied, they did find an association between CoQ10 and increased pregnancy rates. Antioxidants have also been shown to improve live birth rate for couples undergoing fertility treatment. Another Cochrane systematic review concluded that antioxidant supplementation in men can improve live birth, clinical pregnancy rate, and sperm DNA fragmentation. It’s important to note that while antioxidants are typically good for you, they aren’t a cure-all."
