Evidence:"Results of both trials should be available later this year. Meanwhile Meltzer is leading three studies of vitamin D supplementation in populations with mixed ethnicity: one investigation in medically complex patients, a second in health care workers and a third that is community-based. They will assess the impact of various dosages of the vitamin on COVID-19 symptoms and antibodies, as well as on symptoms of other respiratory diseases. Given the results of Neale’s large-scale study and the modest benefits found in Martineau’s latest meta-analysis, it seems unlikely that vitamin D will prove to be a critical ingredient in fending off COVID-19 or modulating its severity. But these and other new trials may find it is useful in certain doses for certain populations. As Neale points out, “there is data that is suggestive” and enough smoke to indicate that you don’t want to be vitamin-D-deficient in a pandemic."

ABERDEEN: Vitamin C is a common remedy that some people believe will cure the common cold and flu.Although it helps us maintain good immune function, however, there’s little evidence that it can prevent or substantially reduce either of these diseases.Yet, in the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak, some “influencers” are claiming that taking mega-doses of vitamin C can cure COVID-19.So let’s cut to the chase. Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus?Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection.CAN VITAMIN C TREAT THE COMMON COLD?Using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up.Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health."

Evidence:"Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36. This observation motivates recent studies on the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Yet the evidence is not conclusive.Our results reconcile the existing different opinions towards the protection of BCG against COVID-19. We show that the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is strongest during the very early stage of the pandemic, while as the government begins to implement social distancing policy, and other actions, the effect of BCG vaccination gradually disappears in the later stages. Although the old vaccines may protect from the virus, the self-protection actions as well as compliance to social distancing policies are still the most protective measures in absence of an effective COVID-19 vaccine.Our study differs from previous studies in several aspects."

Evidence:"There are no health concerns about 5G and COVID-19, despite what conspiracy theorists have suggested. But the transmitter density required for 5G means that more people will be exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs), and at levels that emerging evidence suggests, are potentially harmful to health, argues Professor John William Frank, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh. The advent of 5G technology has been hailed by governments and certain vested interests as transformative, promising clear economic and lifestyle benefits, through massively boosting wireless and mobile connectivity at home, work, school and in the community, he says. But it has become the subject of fierce controversy, fuelled by four key areas of scientific uncertainty and concern. The lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; and a growing but far from comprehensive body of laboratory research indicating the biologically disruptive potential of RF-EMFs  
An almost total lack (as yet) of high quality epidemiological studies of the impact on human health from 5G EMF exposure
Mounting epidemiological evidence of such effects from previous generations of RF-EMF exposure at lower levels
Persistent allegations that some national telecomms regulatory authorities haven’t based their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, amid potential conflicts of interest
5G uses much higher frequency (3 to 300GHz) radio waves than in the past and it makes use of very new—and relatively unevaluated, in terms of safety—supportive technology to enable this higher data transmission capacity, points out Professor Frank. Its inherent fragility means that transmission boosting ‘cell’ antennae are generally required every 100–300 m—which is far more spatially dense than the transmission masts required for older 2G, 3G and 4G technology, using lower frequency waves, he says."

Transfusions of blood plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 may help patients hospitalized with the virus, a new international study shows. The treatment, known as convalescent plasma, is still considered experimental by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plasma contains antibodies, blood proteins that are part of the immune system. Shaped so they can attach to the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibodies glom onto and tag it for removal from the body, researchers say."

REUTERS/Emily ElconinJan 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine can be administered along with its pneumonia vaccine and produced strong safety and immune responses in people aged 65 and above in a late-stage study.The study, initiated in May, tested the company's next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PREVNAR 20, with a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shot in 570 participants.The aim of the study was to test the safety of the combination and the immune response after adding the pneumonia vaccine to the existing COVID-19 vaccine.The company said responses elicited by PREVNAR 20 and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were similar when given together or with placebo.The data provides evidence supporting the potential to administer PREVNAR 20 and the company's COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, reducing the number of visits people make to doctors or pharmacies for recommended immunization, Pfizer said.PREVNAR 20 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June last year to help protect adults against most invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia.Study participants were recruited from the companies' late-stage COVID-19 vaccine study, and those who had received the second dose of the company's COVID-19 vaccine at least six months before entering the co-administration study.Reporting by Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru;

Evidence:"Therefore, response to treatment in patients with COVID-19 might be affected by SexHs-related factors.Recently, the effect of SexH therapy has been investigated in COVID-19, and there are ongoing clinical trials to examine the impact of SexHs on COVID-19. Studies have investigated and discussed the possible therapeutic role of spironolactone, an anti-androgenic agent, in COVID-19 [57,58]. Estrogens and progesterone are other candidates against COVID-19 [37]. Considering the important role of SexHs, clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to sex differences in the dose and scheduling of COVID-19 vaccination [59].In summary, differences in the production of SexHs might lead to a disparity between females and males in terms of dealing with the infection. Note that sex-specific production of SexHs during different life stages might contribute to COVID-19 onset, progression, and even vaccine efficacy and drug response. The role of SexHs should be considered in the design of effective COVID-19 prevention strategies."

Evidence:"A research paper published at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic found that the cough suppressant, dextromethorphan, helps increase the rate of replication (multiplying) of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The authors of this research added that more research is needed to find out which medications are safe to take during the coronavirus infection.One important thing to consider is that this study was tested using cells in a lab and not on human beings. Based on this major factor, there is not enough evidence to conclude that dextromethorphan is not safe to take if someone is COVID-19 positive. So should you still avoid dextromethorphan with a coronavirus infection? It is completely up to you.

Evidence:"At day 6 after LPV/r therapy was initiated, 68.42% of patients were virologically cured, increasing to 84.22% at day 12.Conclusion In this cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r within 12 days of the onset of symptoms, clinical improvement was observed in 18/19 patients (94.74%). Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to further evaluate this strategy.KEYWORDS:lopinavir–ritonavirSARS-CoV-2COVID-19IntroductionOne of the most promising drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lopinavir–ritonavir (LPV/r). But it is dispiriting that no benefit has been observed with LPV/r treatment in recent open-label randomised controlled trials in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19.1,2 However, in a posthoc subgroup analysis of the patients who were treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms, the mortality in standard-care group was numerically greater than the LPV/r group.1 It seems that early intervention with LPV/r may be of benefit in COVID-19. This hypothesis was also supported by a retrospective analysis which identified that COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir-combined regimen with a median length of time between the onset of symptoms and therapy initiation of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3–6).3 At present, the results regarding the efficacy of LPV/r treatment in COVID-19 show inconsistency between studies.4–7 Whether this is caused by the therapeutic window of LPV/r is still not well illustrated.In this retrospective observational study, we aim to present the effects of an early intervention with LPV/r on patients with severe COVID-19 in a single centre, providing additional evidence on the clinical use of LPV/r in COVID-19.MethodsStudy design and participantsThis retrospective study included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r and discharged or died from 27 January 2020 to 24 March 2020 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. The inclusion criteria of our study were patients aged 18–80 years with molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 infections who were classified as severe cases on admission and who received LPV/r treatment as least 3 days. Cases where the length of time between the onset of symptoms and initiating LPV/r therapy was >12 days, where LPV/r therapy was used in combination with other antiviral(s) after admission, or where there was insufficient information of the evaluation indexes were excluded from the study."

Evidence:"N. Srikanth, an Ayurvedic practitioner and a deputy director general at CCRAS, tells ScienceInsider that trials of Ayurvedic therapies for COVID-19 are underway. And on 9 October, an association of government Ayurvedic scientists said IMA's claim that Ayurvedic drugs were no better than placebos was "rigorously condemnable." They pointed out that some modern medical practitioners continue to use drugs such as hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, even though there is little evidence for their efficacy. (India's health ministry recommended hydroxychloroquine both as treatment and prevention for the pandemic coronavirus in March, based on a few small and inconclusive clinical trials, a decision it didn't roll back after subsequent larger studies failed to bear out their advice.) Any system of medicine, whether modern or alternative, must back up claims of efficacy with well-conducted trials, he says."

Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2
The following questions and answers provide a brief introduction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its use for environmental disinfection, often called UV germicidal irradiation or UVGI. UV has been used for disinfection in certain settings (e.g., healthcare environments, correctional facilities) and during the COVID-19 pandemic there has been interest in expanding its use to more settings and situations. We describe what we know about UV disinfection for SARS-CoV-2, potential uses for surface and air disinfection (e.g., upper room UVGI; in-duct or in-line UVGI), as well as limitations and potential harms.
