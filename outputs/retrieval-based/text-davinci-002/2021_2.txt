Edward Reynolds draws together the evidenceFolic acid is important for functioning of the nervous system at all ages.1–4 In the fetus the relation between maternal folate status and the risk of neural tube defects is well established: clinical trials have shown that periconceptual preventive treatment with 400 μg or higher of folic acid significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism are associated with a variety of overlapping syndromes which are influenced by age of clinical presentation. These include developmental delay, cognitive deterioration, motor and gait abnormalities, behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, seizures, signs of demyelination or failure of myelination, and vascular changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging or postmortem examination.4 Less commonly, subacute combined degeneration and peripheral neuropathy may also occur.In adult patients presenting with megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, approximately two thirds have neuropsychiatric disorders which overlap considerably with those associated with anaemia due to vitamin B-12 deficiency.2,5 However, depression is commoner in patients with folate deficiency, and subacute combined degeneration with peripheral neuropathy is more frequent in those with vitamin B-12 deficiency. The degree of anaemia is poorly correlated with the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders, but if these anaemias were left untreated nearly all patients would eventually develop neuropsychiatric complications.2 Over the past 35 years numerous studies have shown a high incidence of folate deficiency correlated with mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline in epileptic, neurological, psychiatric, geriatric, and psychogeriatric populations.3,4 Furthermore, recent studies in elderly people suggest a link between folic acid, homocysteine, ageing, depression, and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease.4,6–9In this paper I review the evidence relating folate deficiency to depression and dementia, especially in the ageing nervous system. Summary pointsFolate deficiency is associated with depression and dementiaIn elderly people it may be related to ageing, poor diet, malabsorption, drugs, or increased demand or be unexplainedFolic acid has particular effects on mood and cognitive and social functionImpaired folate metabolism may result in a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that resembles ageingThe duration of folate deficiency and of its treatment is as important as the degree of deficiency and the dose of folic acidFolic acid should be used with caution in the presence of vitamin B-12 deficiency or epilepsyFolic acid is important in the nervous system at all ages, but in elderly people deficiency contributes to ageing brain processes, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and, if critically severe, can lead to a reversible dementiaPatients with epilepsyMany studies of folate in serum, red cells, or cerebrospinal fluid have shown a consistent association between drug induced deficiency and mental changes, especially depression, apathy, psychomotor retardation and dementia.3,4Treatment of 26 folate deficient epileptic patients with 5 mg of folic acid daily for one to three years resulted in improved drive, initiative, alertness, concentration, mood, and sociability in most.1 This contradicted the prevailing view that folic acid was harmful only to the nervous system, although that concept was reinforced by the additional observation that seizure control deteriorated in several of the patients."

Evidence:"There is older and newer research that seems to demonstrate that duct tape works better for wart treatment than other methods, such as freezing.One 2003 study claims that duct tape is 80 percent effective for speeding up the rate at which warts go away.More clinical research is needed to discover if, and why, duct tape works to get rid of warts. What to know before you use this methodAvoid using duct tape on a wart that is:near your genitalsunder your armpitsclose to one of your mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Plantar warts, which occur on your heels or other parts of your feet, may be more resistant to these treatments because the layers of skin on your feet tend to be more difficult to remove. If you have genital warts, visit a doctor. Human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes topical and genital warts, can be transmitted sexually. Certain strains of HPV are associated with a greater risk of cervical cancer.Since genital warts are transmitted sexually, get tested to see which strain of HPV you have before you try any home treatments for your warts. Duct tape can cause redness, bleeding, rashes, and pain upon removal."

        Abstract
      The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter."

Evidence:"Hath yoga is a physical method which uses the breath to link the various parts of the body and the mind and to allow them to behave as one functional unit which helps in the control of Asthma (9–11).Different studies have revealed that yoga has significant importance in improving symptoms of asthmatics and in hypertension (12–18). It was found that one preliminary study of yoga therapy for asthma on 46 patients data clearly shows a significant qualitative improvement in the severity and duration of attacks; attacks per week and decrease medication use (19).Significant symptomatic improvement after yoga training for 9 months in patients with chronic severe airways obstruction was observed in Australia. A decade ago both short and long-term prospective studies in India showed clearly the beneficial effects of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma (20). A study showed significant effect with in short time (13 days) of yoga practice (21).Since bronchial asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in resource limited areas where the long term use of multiple drugs is costly, it is wise to think alternative way to treat such an illness with better economic safety and avoid adverse effect of the drugs. The study therefore tries to look into the applicability of yoga as an alternative approach in the treatment of asthma in Ethiopia. The research so conducted aimed at determining the clinical features, peak expiratory flow rate and use of drugs for their asthma in asthmatic patients before and after the yoga practice.Patients and MethodsThe study was conducted at the missionary of charity in Jimma town, southwest Ethiopia from March 28 to April 27, 2009 GC."

Evidence:"If anything, the adage should be, “feed a cold, feed a fever,” because bodies fighting illness need energy, so eating healthy food helps. Eating food when you have a cold can also help the body generate heat, although other methods of keeping warm, like wearing an extra layer of clothes or wrapping yourself in a blanket, do the trick as well. There are many reasons you shouldn’t try to starve a fever. Fever is part of the immune system’s attempt to combat the virus. Fever raises body temperature, which increases metabolism and burns more calories. That’s one reason why taking in calories becomes important."

Evidence:"More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.Study characteristics
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.Key results
All of the high‐quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome ‐ prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high‐grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose‐response relation."

Evidence:"If you’ve ever dealt with eczema, you know how uncomfortable it can be. The most common course of treatment is easing symptoms, often with herbal supplements, such as evening primrose oil. Evening primrose oil is also a treatment for psoriasis and acne. It’s been linked to treatment for arthritis, osteoporosis, breast pain, diabetic neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. The United Kingdom once approved evening primrose oil for eczema and breast pain treatment, but they revoked the license in 2002 due to insufficient evidence that it works. Today, there’s conflicting evidence that it is effective for treating eczema.The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine lists it as ineffective for treating eczema when taken orally, and a 2013 study found it to be no more effective than placebo pills."

Evidence:"Studies examining both operatively and nonoperatively treated ankle fractures were included. There is minimal evidence supporting the use of functional bracing over cast immobilization to improve functional outcome, range of motion, swelling, or post-traumatic arthrosis after ankle fracture in the long term. The primary benefits of functional bracing are the potential to return to work earlier and bracing may facilitate activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing. In addition, there may be a decreased patient risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization. However, there is an increased risk of wound infection when using a brace after open reduction and internal fixation of an unstable ankle fracture. Functional bracing can be used for treating stable and postoperative ankle fractures in compliant patients to potentially expedite and facilitate the recovery process."

Healing scarsOne study found that vitamin E and Aquaphor ointments were no different in healing 90 percent of scars in people who had recently had patches of skin cancer removed. And one-third of the participants who used vitamin E developed a red, itchy rash called contact dermatitis.However, a different study found that children with surgical scars who used vitamin E three times a day didn’t develop keloids, or extra scar tissue over the wound. Researchers concluded that using a topical form of vitamin E before and after surgery improved the way wounds healed.Research on how vitamin E can treat acne and heal its scars is inconclusive. There’s little proof that vitamin E oil can help heal scars."

Evidence:"Supplementation was associated with significant decrease in migraine attack frequency and severity, as well as decreased P1 amplitude on VEPs, and increased cortical blood flow to the inferolateral temporal, inferofrontal and insular regions seen on SPECT. The authors suggested that magnesium may interfere with both neurogenic and vascular mechanisms of migraine and may hence be an effective prophylactic treatment. Other studies using SPECT have shown conflicting results (Ramadan et al., 1991; Ferrari et al., 1995; Olesen et al., 1982).Women with menstrually-related migraine (MRM) may be particularly prone to developing magnesium deficiency. A prospective study involving 270 women, 61 of whom had MRM, showed that 45% had ionized magnesium deficiency during MRM attacks, 15% during non- menstrual attacks, 14% during menstruation without migraine and 15% between menstruation without migraine (Mauskop et al., 2002). Serum ionized calcium/magnesium levels were elevated in MRM, with normal ionized calcium levels.Magnesium deficiency has also been found in paediatric migraine, with decreased levels of serum, RBC and mononuclear blood cell magnesium found in paediatric migraineurs with or without aura compared with patients with tension type headache and controls (Soriani et al., 1995; Mazzotta et al., 1999). Magnesium supplementation may be a safe and well- tolerated option for migraine prophylaxis in the prevention of paediatric migraine."

Evidence:"Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:
Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes. Resistance training and aerobic exercise both helped to lower insulin resistance in previously sedentary older adults with abdominal obesity at risk for diabetes."

Evidence:"But the drug is not currently FDA-approved to treat hair loss when taken orally — and so any prescription for this purpose is considered “off-label.”4. The Research on Taking Minoxidil Orally for Hair Loss Is LackingSo far, there isn’t enough high-quality research to support oral minoxidil for hair loss. But a handful of small studies suggest that oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss, and may be more effective for some patients than topical treatments, Dr. Sattur says.For example, one small observational study involving 100 women experiencing female pattern hair loss suggested that a daily pill containing 0.25 milligrams (mg) minoxidil and 25 mg spironolactone was safe and effective in treating the condition. But the study did not use a control group, so it’s not clear whether these results are due to the medication.A later review, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in July 2020, looked at 17 studies involving 634 patients. The review suggested that oral minoxidil was a generally effective and well-tolerated alternative to topical minoxidil, though researchers add that larger, controlled studies are needed.5. There’s No Standard Dosage for Oral MinoxidilSattur points out that most of these studies looked at doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 5 mg — less than the doses used for hypertension."

Alternative medical treatment
Hoxsey Therapy or Hoxsey Method is an alternative medical treatment promoted as a cure for cancer. The treatment consists of a caustic herbal paste for external cancers or an herbal mixture for "internal" cancers, combined with laxatives, douches, vitamin supplements, and dietary changes. Reviews by major medical bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society,[1] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,[2] and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,[3] have found no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The sale or marketing of the Hoxsey Method was banned in the United States by the FDA on September 21, 1960 as a "worthless and discredited" remedy and a form of quackery. [4]
Currently, the Hoxsey Method is primarily marketed by the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico. Hoxsey Therapy is also marketed over the Internet; in June 2008, the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator noted that "There is no scientific evidence that it has any value to treat cancer, yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that Hoxsey treatment is effective against the disease."
Question:Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"[4,5,6] However, it is important to remember that findings in animal studies don't necessarily translate to humans. So let's dive into the recently available research unveiling the “stress-reducing” effect of L-theanine in humans. L-theanine’s impact on stress and anxiety: Human studies
A recent 2016 systematic review looked at all available human clinical trials that examined the effects of supplemental L-theanine consumption (200-400 mg/day) on stress and anxiety. Of the five randomized controlled trials, four trials found that L-theanine was associated with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations. [1] However, these studies only looked at those experiencing acute stress, and more research is needed to evaluate L-theanine’s impact on chronic stress. One randomized control trial showed particular promise for the future of L-theanine research."

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  
Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:
The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)
Steam Inhalation and Sleep
There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  
Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Educational dropout and learning disabilities in the early years of schooling may be due to insufficient iron stores, and many mental and behavioral problems in children have been attributed to IDA.10 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of four basic strategies including iron supplementation, appropriate nutrition education, the enrichment of foods with iron compounds, and the control of parasitic and infectious diseases to prevent and control anemia and iron deficiency anemia.11 Lack of knowledge in both nutritional needs and nutritional values of different foods is a major contributor to the prevalence of malnutrition among primary school children and vulnerable groups. Schools as a broad base serve a large population of children and play an important role in the transfer of health information to individuals, families, and society.12 Nutrition education applied should be easily adapted to socio-economic status, dietary habits and locally available traditional food resources.13 Considering the role of nutrition disorder in the prevalence of IDA,14 strategies for nutritional improvement are safe ways to control and prevent micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron.15 Therefore, if IDA is diagnosed early, it can be treated or prevented by modifying the nutritional status and the administration of iron supplements.16Considering the prevalence of IDA and the effect of nutritional education on the prevention and control of it, the use of date fruit can contribute to controlling IDA. Dates (Phoenix dactylifera) are one among the fruits used in the human diet that possess a high nutritional value.17 There are 314 calories in 100 g of date. Ten minerals are reported, the major being selenium, copper, potassium, and magnesium. The consumption of 100 g of dates can provide over 15% of the recommended daily allowance from these minerals.18 In addition, the amount of iron in dates is about 0.3 mg to 10.4 mg per 100 g. Therefore, eating a few dates daily will provide your body’s daily iron. Also, dates contain vitamin C and fiber, which increase iron absorption.19 Yossef et al (2015) found that the use of dates in the treatment of IDA of children is beneficial and the iron content in 100 g of black dates is reported to be 166.5 mg.20 Dates have also been shown to contain other properties that are useful in treatment or prevention of events such as fatigue, reinforcement of kidney, chronic cough, rheumatoid arthritis and back pain, diarrhea, kidney stone, and peptic ulcers.19,21 Dates contain anticancer properties that may also help prevent the disease.22 Dates also serve as a good source of natural antioxidants.23 Dates can improve hemoglobin (Hgb) levels via increasing erythrocyte production.24 It seems that the  prevalence of IDA  is  high  in female students of Zahedan City, Iran,7 and the abundance of dates in this area.25 Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of consumption of date fruit on IDA among primary school girl students.26Methods and MaterialsThis was a semi-experimental study."

Evidence:"Laboratory research has firmly established that experimental creation of omega-3 deficiency causes abnormal behavior in lab animals. And in human studies, researchers have repeatedly discovered associations between omega-3 fatty acid levels and symptoms of psychosis, depression, impulsivity and self-harm. Emerging research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can be used therapeutically in borderline personality disorder. In treatment studies, researchers rely on just two omega-3 components: EPA and DHA. Silvio Bellino and colleagues from the University of Turin in Italy showed that EPA (1200 mg per day) plus DHA (800 mg per day), when added to therapeutic doses of Depakote, reduced impulsivity, anger, and self-harm in a group of patients with borderline personality disorder.

Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula.BackgroundAllergy, which affects over 20% of people, is a specific reaction to a normally harmless substance (allergen) characterised by a specific IgE response.

Evidence:"An estimated 48.5 million couples worldwide are infertile,1 and approximately 40%–50% percent of cases are attributed to female factors.2,3 Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are a cornerstone of infertility treatment, with more than 600,000 cycles performed each year in North America and Europe alone.4–6 Nevertheless, success rates remain relatively low; in 2015 in the US, approximately only one of three ART cycles started with the intention to transfer an embryo resulted in a live birth.4 It is thus of vital importance to identify potentially modifiable predictors of treatment outcome, including diet.7Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress impairs gamete and embryo development during ART.8 In addition, infertile women have been reported to have a lower total antioxidant status.9,10 It has thus been suggested that antioxidant supplements may improve infertility treatment outcomes with ART.11 However, high intake of some vitamins, such as vitamin A, may result in adverse reproductive outcomes.12,13 Furthermore, the relation between micronutrients and ART outcomes may not necessarily be linear.14While several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have addressed this question, their findings are inconsistent. A 2017 Cochrane review of RCTs concluded that antioxidant supplementation during the course of infertility treatment showed limited benefit for increasing the probability of pregnancy or live birth and that, among women undergoing ART specifically, antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate.11 However, as acknowledged by the authors, this evidence suffers from multiple important gaps. First, few trials reported effects of the intervention on live birth rates. In addition, few of the trials included in the meta-analysis tested the same intervention and estimated pooled data from interventions as dissimilar as multiple micronutrient blends (including proprietary blends whose composition cannot be established) to selected combinations of specific micronutrients at considerably different doses, to interventions of substances without direct antioxidant potential. These issues make it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the effects–or lack thereof–of antioxidants on ART outcomes. A particularly important gap to move the field forward is to identify which specific antioxidants and at which doses may offer benefit to inform the design of new trials."
