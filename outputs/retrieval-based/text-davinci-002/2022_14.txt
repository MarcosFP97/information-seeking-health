Evidence:"Just take them out before bedtime. They act as a protective bandage, controlling both swelling and bleeding. For that reason we ask you to “take it easy” the first day.If bleeding seems excessive, remove any blood clots that may have formed outside the tooth sockets, then bite on a dampened tea bag placed directly over the bleeding site. (The tannic acid in the tea helps blood clot.) If bleeding continues an hour after the tea bag is used, then moisten gauze and place in freezer for 20 minutes, then bite on the gauze for 30 minutes. This should stop the bleeding.Medication To Reduce DiscomfortWe have either written a prescription for a medication to reduce discomfort and inflammation or suggested one for you to get at the pharmacy."

Evidence:"In the modern world, crystals remind us to connect with ourselves and the earth's wisdom.”Photo: Wolfgang Hasselmann / UnsplashAt the heart of crystal culture is a genuine belief that these rocks contain energising and healing properties. There is little scientific evidence to support this idea but they are said to have a unique vibration that works with our chemistry. Here’s the theory: everything in  nature vibrates at a specific frequency, as a result of moving atoms and molecules. Crystals are thought to vibrate at a high frequency – ergo the can lift our low ‘vibe’ when we feel emotionally down or sluggish.“Each crystal vibrates at its own frequency and has its own special properties that  resonate with your energy,” explains Emma Lucy Knowles, a crystal healer of 16 years and author of The Power of Crystal Healing: Change Your Energy and Live A High-Vibe Life, which has been translated internationally. “Crystals work to heal or realign your energy and help you reach your goals.” Mannelqvist concurs: “When you hold a crystal over the body, it interacts with your chakras, or energy centres, and may promote physical and mental wellness.”In other words, crystals are a bit like tuning forks, bringing our energy back into balance."

Evidence:"Some scientists argue no plausible biological mechanism exists by which cell phone radiation could cause cancer. "It's impossible for cell phones to cause cancer because the electromagnetic fields they generate cannot break chemical bonds between molecules," says Gary Arendash, Ph.D., a research professor at the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. That process, he explains, is thought to be key to increasing cancer risk. "UV light from the sun causes skin cancer, for example. But cell phones provide radiation that is thousands of times weaker than UV rays and X-rays—it's similar to that generated by a one-watt flashlight. This is too weak to cause cancer.""

Evidence:"As long as you’re able to practice with minimal knee joint discomfort, it’s safe to include squats in your exercise routine.People with arthritis may find the most benefit in wall squats, since squatting against the wall can help reduce your risk of putting unnecessary or incorrect pressure on your knees.To do a basic squat:Stand with your back against a wall. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your heels about 18 inches away from wall.Keep your knees in line with your heels, not out in front of your toes.Breathe in and exhale as you sit down or “squat.” Your buttocks shouldn’t drop any lower than knee level.Keep your abdominal muscles tight and ensure that your back is pressed flat against the wall.Push up through your heels — not the balls of your feet — and inhale as you stand up.“Keep the knee over the ankle and not over the ball of the foot,” Bell cautions.“If you begin to experience intense pain at any point — more than your typical knee pain — you should stop the practice for the day. “Be sure to give the move another try during your next practice. You’ll find that your pain threshold increases as you build up muscle strength.”How to practice deep lungingFor people with knee osteoarthritis, lunging poses the same benefits and risks as deep squatting. Lunges are a great way to improve your overall leg and hip strength, but they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly.The trick, Bell says, is to make sure your knee doesn’t extend past your ankle.You may also find it helpful to practice lunges while holding on to the back of a chair or table for added support.To do a basic lunge:Grab on to your support, if needed.Step forward with one leg."

Evidence:"Some of the most common examples of ACE inhibitors are (FDA, 2015):  
Enalapril/enalaprilat (brand name Vasotec)Lisinopril (brand name Zestril and Prinivil)Ramipril (brand name Altace)
ACE inhibitors do not seem to be associated with erectile dysfunction (Nicolai, 2014). ARBs
ARB stands for angiotensin II receptor blockers. On the surface, that might sound pretty similar to ACE inhibitors, but they work differently. ACE inhibitors decrease the amount of angiotensin II in the body, while ARBs work by blocking angiotensin II from attaching to receptors on cells (Barreras, 2003). Remember that angiotensin raises blood pressure, so blocking the receptor for that hormone lowers blood pressure. Some FDA-approved ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), eprosartan (Tevetan), and losartan (Cozaar)."

Evidence:"· Diabetes,Type 1 Diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes,Carbohydrates,Blood SugarFruit juice contains a large amount of sugar which raises blood sugar levels very quickly. Therefore, people with diabetes are usually best to avoid drinking fruit juice.As a general rule, eating whole fruit is healthier than drinking fruit juice or fruit smoothies.Once regarded as a healthy drink, recent research indicates that that regular consumption of fruit juice may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What's in fruit juice? Aside from vitamin C and calcium, fruit juice contains:Calories - 250ml glass of unsweetened orange juice typically contains around 100 calories, compared to the 60 calories in an actual orangeFructose (a form of sugar) - half a pint of fruit juice contains more sugar than the World Health Organization recommends ideally having in a day (30g of sugar for men, 24g for women)A lack of fiber - juice always contains less fiber than whole fruit and highly processed juices may not contain any fiber How does fruit juice affect blood sugar? Sugar levels in fruit juice can cause a significant spike in blood sugar levels, increasing the risk of hyperglycemia (too high blood sugar levels).The glycemic index, which is used to reflect the impact on blood sugar levels of individual foods, places orange juice between 66 and 76 on a scale of 100. This makes fruit juice a high GI drink and high GI foods and drinks are best avoided by people with diabetes under most circumstances.One situation in which fruit juice can be useful is to raise blood sugar quickly in response to hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar)."

Evidence:"To complicate matters, the level of salt gets becomes more concentrated as you become more dehydrated. Dehydrated individuals can quickly reach excessive levels of sodium in their urine. Thus, by drinking urine you will be consuming even more sodium, and higher levels of sodium in your body quickly lead to feeling thirstier. Conclusion: drinking urine in these circumstances is a bad idea as your body quickly develops a negative feedback loop in which, despite drinking fluids, you feel thirstier.To summarize:Drinking urine will not improve a person’s health. In some cases, it may even worsen health issues.Anyone seeking natural remedies should consult a doctor or another healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about the subject.When access to water is scarce, it is important to seek a healthy source, such as clear rainwater, condensation, or water in food, especially water-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables.Drinking urine may make dehydration worse and intensify any side effects.

Evidence:"This is also applicable to the fibers that make up cellulite, of which are mainly collagen and subcutaneous fat depositions subsequently. By extension of this bodily fluid displacement by way of pulsating force and vibrations imparted through massage guns, the sort of fluid that builds up within said fibrous collagen tissue as well as within the fat deposition pockets themselves will cause a marked improvement in their aesthetic appearance due to a reduction in their size and color. When combined with more invasive treatment therapies, a suitable exercise routine and a diet geared towards a reduction in bodily fat composition, massage guns can be an excellent supplementary device for reducing the appearance of cellulite – albeit a temporary one, if used on their own. Despite a large volume of evidence showing that cessation of massage gun treatment to areas afflicted with cellulite will result in a subsequent cessation of improvements, there is some small evidence that performing this treatment for a long enough period can in fact induce more permanent improvements. In a rather impressive study conducted by the proDERM Institute of Applied Dermatological Research based in Germany, it was found that – even in comparison to a secondary control group- women utilizing over twelve weeks of continuous localized vibrational massage therapy through the use of a massage device experienced some level of permanent reduction in the size and appearance of their cellulite deposits."

Evidence:"“Animal-based foods have been an important part of the human diet for at least three million years. Eliminating all animal foods would be like deciding you’re going to feed a tiger tofu and expect that it’s going to be healthy. If you want an organism to thrive, you should feed it the diet for which it’s been genetically adapted via evolution down through the ages.”
Compared to the standard American diet of highly processed, low-fiber, high-calorie, sugary foods, vegan diets have some health advantages. However, researchers found that avoiding all animal foods may lead to nutritional deficiencies in vitamin B12, omega-3, calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium, and high-quality protein. These deficiencies may be associated with increased risk for certain types of cancer, stroke, bone fractures, preterm birth, and failure to thrive. Avoiding consumption of animal-sourced food may also be related to higher rates of depression and anxiety."

Evidence:"Recent articles indicate that hydroquinone causes low levels of toxicity and regulatory authorities in Germany, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and the European Union have classified it as a suspected carcinogen.3
Clinical safety of hydroquinone
The banning of hydroquinone in over-the-counter products in Europe was due to the concerns of ochronosis and not due to the potential carcinogenic potential. The fear of hydroquinone causing permanent discolouration and ochronosis were the main reasons behind the ban. Ochronosis is caused by the over-application of the hydroquinone. It is the duration and the percentage of the hydroquinone used that determines the occurrence of ochronosis. Ochronosis was first reported by Findlay et al. in South African Bantu women who applied hydroquinone in high concentrations and for a long period of time.10 Most of the cases reported in the USA are from the use of 2% hydroquinone.11 Hydroquinone is a major metabolic by-product of benzene."

   Risks of UTIs in men  
Anatomy benefits aside, men can get UTIs, and there are some things that can increase their risk. "For men, there almost always has to be an underlying condition to get a UTI," says Dr. Herman. Men can get UTIs if they have kidneys stones or an enlarged prostate, says Bruce Sloane, MD, urologist at Philadelphia Urology Associates. Both can cause a blockage in the urinary tract, leading to a back-up of urine that creates a bacteria-friendly environment. Some STIs, including chlamydia or gonorrhea, can also lead to inflammation of the urethra, notes the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which makes it easier for bacteria to infect the urinary tract. Diabetes is another condition that increases men's risk of diabetes."

Have you ever heard that carrots are good for your eyes, or that they can help you see in the dark?It's true – carrots are rich in the compound beta carotene, which your body uses to make a form of vitamin A that helps your eyes adjust in the dark.That's just one of the important links between Vitamin A and eye health. Vitamin A is critical for our ability to see, according to a recent report from the Defense Health Agency's Vision Center of Excellence in Falls Church, Virginia. "There are many factors that affect your eyes and vision, including genetics and age," said Maria Viswanathan, ophthalmologist at the VCE. "Adequate amounts of Vitamin A can help prevent the development of night blindness and slow age-related decline in sight. "With low vitamin A levels, the eye is unable to send visual signals to the brain. This can result in night blindness as an initial symptom."

Feature | Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) | September 07, 2016 MRIs in Pregnancy Safe, But Gadolinium Scans May Raise Risk to FetusStudy finds MRIs in first trimester of pregnancy were not associated with increased risk
This study found MRI is safe by itself, but the use of gadolinium contrast may be a factor involved with an array of issues that impact the fetus and young children after birth. September 7, 2016 — In an analysis that included more than 1.4 million births, exposure to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first trimester of pregnancy compared with nonexposure was not associated with increased risk of harm to the fetus or in early childhood. However, data suggests gadolinium contrast enhanced MRI scans at any time during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of a broad set of rheumatological, inflammatory or skin conditions and, possibly, for stillbirth or neonatal death, according to a study appearing in the Sept. 6, 2016, issue of Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). [1]
Concern has been expressed about the safety of MRI exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy due to the heating of sensitive tissues by radiofrequency fields and exposure to the loud acoustic environment. When indicated, MRI's diagnostic accuracy is improved with gadolinium, an intravenous contrast agent."

The association advised that people with mild to moderate high blood pressure and high cholesterol can lower them with exercise. Here's how to avoid it
      People don’t need to have an intense session at the gym to achieve the activity level necessary to reap the benefits, said Bethany Barone Gibbs, lead author of the AHA’s scientific statement and associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Health and Human Development and Clinical and Translational Science. “Though planned exercise is great, just getting more active in your everyday life – like taking the stairs and picking up the pace while you walk the dog – can also give you the same benefits,” Gibbs said. Physical activity helps train the body to get rid of harmful substances in the bloodstream, and it improves the function of the blood vessels, she added."

So while you already know the successful recipe for sustainable weight loss — a healthier overall diet, regular movement, stress relief, proper recovery and quality sleep — here’s a look at whether or not chewing gum might also play a role in helping you slim down. In some scenarios, chewing gum can help with weight loss. Sometimes I recommend my weight-loss clients chew mint-flavored gum directly after meals or when they can clearly identify they are just bored and want to turn to food as an oral pacifier. The minty flavor can be enough to deter the desire for sweet foods and the constant chewing can be enough to alleviate boredom. Chewing gum can be more like a bandage, though."

These fluids include:bloodsemenvaginal fluidanal fluidbreast milkFor transmission of the virus to occur, these fluids then must make contact with a mucous membrane (like the vagina, penis, rectum, or mouth), a cut or injury, or be injected straight into the bloodstream.The vast majority of the time, HIV is spread through the following activities:having anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medications to prevent HIV transmissionsharing needles or sharing equipment used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIVHIV may also be spread in these ways, but it’s not common:via an HIV-positive person who transmits the virus to their child during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding (however, many people living with HIV are able to have healthy, HIV-negative babies by getting good prenatal care; that care includes being tested for HIV and beginning HIV treatment, if needed)accidentally being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needleIn extremely rare cases, HIV can be transmitted in the following ways:oral sex, if an HIV-positive person ejaculates into their partner’s mouth and the partner has an open cut or lesion a blood transfusion or organ transplant that contains HIV (the chance of this happening now is very rare — less than 1 in 1.5 million — because blood and organ/tissue is meticulously tested for diseases)food that has been prechewed (premasticated) by a person living with HIV, but only if blood from the person’s mouth mixes with food while being chewed and the person who receives the chewed food has an open wound in their mouth (the only reports of this have been between caregivers and infants; there are no reports of this kind of transmission between adults)a bite, if an HIV-positive person bites and breaks the skin, causing extensive tissue damage (only a few cases of this have been documented)blood containing HIV coming in contact with a wound or an area of broken skinin one case, open-mouth kissing, if both partners have bleeding gums or sores (in this case, the virus is transmitted through the blood, not the saliva)sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses (there are no known cases in the United States of anyone contracting HIV this way) The bottom lineHaving a better understanding about HIV transmission not only prevents the spread of HIV, but also prevents the spread of misinformation."

Evidence:"If you appreciate their exotic appearance and pinkish dim light, they’ll make a good addition to your home or yoga studio. You’ll only be disappointed if you expect them to improve any health conditions. The science behind their health benefits is shaky and, for the most part, nonexistent. Only one benefit stands a chance: using them instead of bright light in the evening (while avoiding blue light altogether) might reduce sleep problems. But you’d accomplish the same with any dim decorative light."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Moderate-quality evidence suggested no increased incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment or any change in cognitive performance related to global cognitive performance scores, executive function, declarative memory, processing speed, or visuoperception. Examination of the FDA postmarketing surveillance databases revealed a low reporting rate for cognitive-related adverse events with statins that was similar to the rates seen with other commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications.Limitations:The absence of many well-powered RCTs for most outcomes resulted in final strengths of evidence that were low or moderate. Imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias also limited the strength of findings.Conclusion:Larger and better-designed studies are needed to draw unequivocal conclusions about the effect of statins on cognition. Published data do not suggest an adverse effect of statins on cognition; however, the strength of available evidence is limited, particularly with regard to high-dose statins.Primary Funding Source:None.References1.

Evidence:"That said, vitamin C can help with your cold in other ways. Here's what you need to know. Vitamin C does not prevent colds"Nobel prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling famously claimed in the 1970s that high doses of vitamin C prevented the common cold," says Mike Sevilla, a family physician in Salem, Ohio.But Pauling had little evidence to back his claim. The foundations of his argument came from a single study of a sample of children in the Swiss Alps, which he then generalized to the overall population.Turns out he overgeneralized, and numerous studies have since disproved Pauling's claim. "Unfortunately, follow-up research has shown that vitamin C does not prevent the common cold," Sevilla says. Yet this misconception continues to live on."

Evidence:"The evidence is not straightforward, as the impact of coffee on weight loss can vary depending on how it is consumed. Carried by curiosity, we explored different ways in which a cup of coffee can potentially support weight loss, as well as some potential risks. How coffee contributes to losing weight:
Caffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that increases your metabolic rate by boosting your body's production of adrenaline. This results in a temporary increase in your heart rate and the amount of energy your body burns, even when you're at rest. This can help you burn more calories throughout the day, leading to weight loss. Appetite suppression: Caffeine can suppress your appetite by altering the levels of certain hormones in your body, such as ghrelin and leptin."

Evidence:"Might support weight lossSeveral studies have looked at the relationship between drinking water and weight loss. While there is some scientific evidence in support of this link, scientists are unclear why this relationship exists and suggest they need further research. A review paper from 2019 on drinking water and weight loss confirms that the current evidence on water and weight loss is low to moderate in quality. Citrus fruits, such as limes, may have bioactive compounds that could help control weight, but doctors require further research to better understand the role limes and water may play in promoting weight loss.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"“For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” says Kurt Straif, MD, head of the IARC Monographs Programme, in a news release.Because colon cancers are slow growing, a person would probably need to eat that way over a period of years or even decades to see that degree of increase in their cancer risk, Katz notes.“It’s really long periods of time that matter,” he says. “I don’t think anybody who once ate a hot dog needs to panic here.” Clinton says we don't have enough information to know if one type of processed meat is worse than another. Also, there are different kinds of processing, and it's unclear which of those may be more hazardous than others. "We cannot equate the cancer risk of one product to another because we just don't have that data," he says.At the same time, the report is a good reminder to make red and processed meats occasional treats, not mealtime staples, says Marion Nestle, PhD, a professor of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University.“It means these are once-in-a-while foods, not every day,” Nestle says.But it's hard to say how much is too much, especially given each person's differing genetics and family cancer history, Clinton says. "Think about your diet as an orchestra. It's not one food."

Evidence:"Skin tags aren’t contagious, and they’re generally harmless. But while they’re not painful, skin tags may get caught on clothing or jewelry, and if the skin tag experiences constant friction from clothes or the body, it may itch or bleed. Skin tags don’t necessarily need to be removed, but if a skin tag appears to be changing or becomes painful, see your dermatologist right away. Most warts are harmless, although plantar warts on the bottoms of the feet may be painful, and mosaic warts, which grow in clusters, may be embarrassing. Warts are contagious and may spread to other parts of the body or to other people."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Oil pulling may help prevent and reverse cavities. By supporting a balance of good-to-bad bacteria in the mouth, oil pulling may help remineralize teeth and play a part in reversing cavities naturally. Your teeth are designed to rebuild (remineralize) themselves on an ongoing basis, but this remineralization is only possible in the presence of the proper nutrients and the absence of cavity-causing bacteria. Overgrowth of harmful bacteria in your mouth, such as Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), can lead to cavities, or “dental caries.”
Oil pulling with both sesame and coconut oils eliminates excessive S. mutans within the mouth just as effectively as the chlorhexidine found in prescription mouthwash. This effect only seems to occur after at least three weeks, though—just one reason why coconut oil pulling should be used as a long-term dental health solution, not a quick fix. While diet is key to healing cavities, coconut oil pulling might also play a useful role by correcting dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and keeping S. mutans in check."
Question:Can oil pulling heal cavities?

yes

Evidence:"Fiber, however, does not cause hemorrhoids -- instead, eating fiber is a method of preventing hemorrhoids. Advertisement
    Misconception
  Common misconceptions about fiber include the belief that eating too much fiber causes you to experience more hemorrhoids, and that too much fiber causes difficult or excess bowel movements. The actual cause of these problems is constipation, the result of eating too much fiber without increasing your water intake. Fiber adds bulk to your stool and absorbs water, which makes it easier to move along your digestive tract. If you do not have enough fluids in your system, your stool dries out, you become constipated and increase your risk of hemorrhoids, or worsen an existing hemorrhoid problem. Advertisement

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"How does grapefruit juice interact with medicines? Grapefruit juice interferes with enzymes responsible for breaking down medicines in the body. So grapefruit and grapefruit juice interactions often lead to an increase in the amount of medicine circulating in your body. These increased blood levels of your medicine can be dangerous and may increase the effect of your medicine until there are potentially serious consequences. For example, if a person taking some blood-pressure medicines consumes grapefruit, the concentration of their blood pressure medicines will rise in their body, and result in their blood pressure becoming dangerously lowered. One serve is all it takes
Just one glass of grapefruit juice or one serve of grapefruit is all it takes to interfere with your medicine."
