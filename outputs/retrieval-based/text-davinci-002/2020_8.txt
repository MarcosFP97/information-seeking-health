Evidence:"Patients receiving both vitamin D2 and D3 were dropped from the analysis, as were people who had their first dose of vitamin D supplementation during the pandemic, since the authors said those patients likely had not been taking the therapy long enough to achieve a benefit.After exclusions, the investigators were left with a study population of 220,265 people who received vitamin D3 supplements, 34,710 people who received vitamin D2, and 407,860 patients who received neither.The investigators found that patients who filled a vitamin D2 prescription were 28% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19, and patients who filled a vitamin D3 prescription were 20% less likely to become infected (hazard ratios [HR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65, 0.79; and HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.83, respectively.) Likewise, 30-day mortality rates following COVID-19 were lower in patients receiving supplementation, though the authors cautioned that the reduction for people taking vitamin D2 did not reach statistical significance (vitamin D2 HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.04; vitamin D3 HR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.75).“These associated reductions in risk are substantial and justify more significant exploration and confirmation using [randomized controlled trials],” Gibbons and colleagues wrote. “This is particularly important given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency in the US population and COVID-19.”The investigators also found notable differences across subgroups. Black patients, for instance, had a greater reduction in COVID-19 infection rates when taking vitamin D3 than did White patients. The authors noted that people with darker skin tend to have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.“[T]hese results suggest that expansion of vitamin D supplementation may potentially reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes,” the authors said.Gibbons and colleagues also found that participants who received higher doses of vitamin D had greater benefits, and that veterans who had vitamin D blood levels between 0 and 19 ng/ml before supplementation had the largest decrease in infection risk.The authors listed a number of limitations to their study. They said they were unable to control for factors such as socioeconomic status, obesity, and adherence to public health precautions."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Therefore, antiviral therapy alone may be insufficient to treat COVID-19 patients.Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) functions as a potent water-soluble antioxidant by directly scavenging oxygen free radicals and acting as an essential co-factor for the production of catecholamines, vasopressin, and cortisol in the human body [12]. Vitamin C is also found in high concentrations in leukocytes and implicated in several immune responses and functions [13]. Emerging evidence in preclinical studies indicated that vitamin C played a crucial role in ameliorating the effects of inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production, assisting immunoregulation, neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protecting host cells [14, 15]. Hypovitaminosis C was ubiquitous in critically ill patients, and approximately 40% of the patients had a severe deficiency [16], while the low vitamin C serum level cannot be corrected by oral supplementation due to the issue of pharmacokinetics [17]. In a latest research, of 18 adult ICU patients COVID-19 who met ARDS criteria, 94.4% had undetectable vitamin C levels and 1 patient had low levels [18]. Thus, high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) was added to the standard therapy of critically ill patients in recent studies, such as sepsis [19,20,21], ARDS [21, 22], cardiac surgery [23], and burn [24]."

Cedars-Sinai Research Raises Possibility That a Century-Old Vaccine May Be Useful Against Coronavirus
A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease.The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.In the new study, published online Nov. 19 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, investigators tested the blood of more than 6,000 healthcare workers in the Cedars-Sinai Health System for evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and also asked them about their medical and vaccination histories.They found that workers who had received BCG vaccinations in the past—nearly 30% of those studied—were significantly less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood or to report having had infections with coronavirus or coronavirus-associated symptoms over the prior six months than those who had not received BCG. These effects were not related to whether workers had received meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations.The reasons for the lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the BCG group were not clear, according to Moshe Arditi, MD, director of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study."

The role of ginger plants against COVID-19
Dear Editor
Thank you to the authors for this thought-provoking editorial [1]. Zimmermann et al (2022) reveal long COVID-19 in children and adolescents, symptoms involving almost every organ system after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concern has focused more on the potential long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, I believe that functional foods, especially Gingerae, play a role in fighting COVID-19. Western medicine solves the issue of human organs, and traditional Chinese medicine solves the issue of human body system; however, functional food is to address the problem of human cells[2]. The 12 key functional components of barley grains and its grass not only play an important role in the prevention and treatment of more than 20 chronic human diseases but also interact with 30 other nutritional functional components to provide the possibility to solve hundreds of human diseases caused by cell undernutrition and their detoxification disorders [2]."

Evidence:"The unfounded rumors sparked a global wave of vandalism against 5G antennae and objects believed to be connected to 5G networks. More than 70 5G masts have been damaged or destroyed in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning that such conspiracy theories linking 5G and COVID-19 "are inciting attacks against the communications infrastructure."

Features and analysis, videos, and infographics explore how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the countries in our region. "Violent extremists have drawn from misinformation campaigns online that claim wireless infrastructure is deleterious to human health and helps spread COVID-19, resulting in a global effort by like-minded individuals to share operational guidance and justification for conducting attacks against 5G infrastructure, some of which have already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several U.S. states," the warning said. StratCom, the European Council’s task force on disinformation within the European Union and its neighborhood, concluded in a report in April that such conspiracy theories have found "fertile soil in the Western Balkans, where disinformation that the 5G network is causing the [COVID-19] pandemic has spread on social networks and portals.""

Evidence:"One is that the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases have bacterial co-infections so that vaccination against pneumococci and Hib prevent these super-infections and the pneumonias they cause. Alternatively, pneumococcal vaccines may protect against COVID-19 is by indirectly vaccinating against SARS-CoV-2 itself. In a second paper, published in Vaccines, I report that pneumococcal vaccines contain bacterial cell wall proteins that mimic SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Antibodies produced against these pneumococcal proteins might, therefore, also protect against the coronavirus. I emphasize that this mechanism for explaining pneumococcal vaccination protection against COVID-19 is, at present, an untested hypothesis. Similarities between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and pneumococcal vaccine proteins pspA, pspC, and psaA."

New Delhi: With evidence growing that women are outliving men in the battle against Covid-19, doctors in the US have begun new clinical trials of administering female sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) on to male patients, in the presumption that these hormones could be at work in keeping women safer. According to a report in The New York Times, doctors in New York began treating patients with estrogen last week in order to increase their immunity."

Evidence:"These findings do not prove that cough medicines containing dextromethorphan will worsen the condition of people infected with coronavirus, or that they will make bad outcomes more likely. But the researchers were concerned enough to advise cough sufferers who might be infected with the virus to avoid these medications and called for more research on the issue. Halfway down the article, however, we find this sentence: “But the group’s discoveries raised hopes as well.”
After mapping the coronavirus’s genome, they identified 322 distinct steps needed to ensure the coronavirus can enter a cell, hijack its machinery, and make copies of itself. Then they looked for compounds that would intervene in this process. The group identified sixty-nine existing drugs, experimental drugs, or compounds on the way to becoming drugs. Some of the compounds the team identified are “many times more potent” than remdesivir, a drug now being used as a COVID-19 treatment."

Evidence:"UV VERSUS COVID-19
Most experts agree high-intensity UV-C can disinfect areas against Covid-19 and kill the SARS-CoV-2 strain quickly. However, there are limitations:
The optimal length of exposure, wavelength and dose of UV-C light needed to kill SARS-CoV-2 varies depending on factors such as the shape and type of contaminated material. Covid-19 requires the highest exposure of UV-C of any virus tested, an amount that’s harmful to humans. It needs direct contact to work, meaning it’s less effective in an area in shadow or covered by dust. Prolonged exposure to such intensive UV-C light can cause textiles, plastics or polymers to degrade. While research shows UV-C light is a feasible way to disinfect spaces, it also highlights the need for it to be carefully operated, adapted and scheduled to be effective in different scenarios, plus only used where no people are present."

Warmer temperatures lessen COVID-19 spread, but control measures still needed
				by 
					Hayley Dunning
					09 June 2021
New research shows transmission of the virus behind COVID-19 varies seasonally, but warmer conditions are not enough to prevent transmission. The study, led by Imperial College London researchers and published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to incorporate environmental data into epidemiological models of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. While people remain unvaccinated, governments mustn’t drop policies like lockdowns and social distancing just because a seasonal change means the weather is warming up. Dr Tom Smith
The team show that temperature and population density are the most important factors determining how easily the virus spreads, but only in the absence of mobility-restricting measures, such as lockdowns. First author of the study Dr Tom Smith, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “Our results show that temperature changes have a much smaller effect on transmission than policy interventions, so while people remain unvaccinated, governments mustn’t drop policies like lockdowns and social distancing just because a seasonal change means the weather is warming up. “However, our work also suggests that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to the virus spreading more easily in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes.”

Seasonal variation has been a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."

Evidence:"The findings were highlighted in an RCT titled “The efficacy of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation on clinical symptoms, duration, severity, and inflammatory factors in COVID-19 outpatients: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial” ​published in BioMed Central.“In animal models, curcumin supplementation was shown to modulate inflammatory response and reduce respiratory distress. Curcumin could bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, thus, may have potential antiviral effects.​“The proven anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin could prevent cytokine storms, and the molecule may also be effective in alleviating the coagulation abnormalities observed in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, curcumin’s immunomodulatory, anti-microbial, antiviral properties, and beneficial effects of curcumin on pneumonia are evidenced,”​ said the researchers.Hence, this RCT aimed to evaluate the effect of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation on clinical symptoms, duration, severity, and inflammatory factors in outpatients with COVID-19.A total of 46 patients aged 18 to 65 years and afflicted with COVID-19 were recruited from the Motamed health centre, affiliated with the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, from November 2020 to April 2021.Subjects were randomly allocated to consume two capsules of curcumin-piperine or a placebo over 14 days. Each curcumin capsule contains 500mg curcumin with 5mg piperine.Findings​The most significant outcome was that 10 patients (83.3%) in the curcumin group and five patients (38.5%) in the placebo group recovered from weakness. This improvement was significantly greater in the curcumin group than in the placebo group.Otherwise, recovery for symptoms like dry cough, sputum cough, sore throat, muscular pain, headaches and dyspnea showed no significant difference between the two groups.However, these findings contradicted results from recent studies, which showed most clinical symptoms like muscle fatigue, cough and chills were significantly reduced. The team postulated that it could be due to the type and dosage.Nonetheless, the study demonstrated a significant reduction in weakness and tiredness in patients supplemented with curcumin, suggesting its immense benefits when facing long COVID-19 disease.Excessive tiredness has been a major complaint by COVID-19 patients and often remains for a long time, possibly causing disability, poor quality of life, pain, memory impairment and sleep abnormalities."

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19. This may make it sound like certain food preferences – such as being vegetarian or a fish eater – may benefit you by reducing the risk of COVID-19."
Question:Can a vegetarian diet prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Flu season in Australia usually runs from June to September, peaking in August, so it is important to get your flu shot in April or May. Does the flu vaccine protect against COVID-19? The flu vaccine won’t protect you against COVID-19 (coronavirus), but it will reduce your risk of influenza — which leads to thousands of hospitalisations each year. By getting the flu vaccine, you can reduce the strain on the health service. Can I get the influenza (flu) vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time? You can get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time."
Question:Can getting a flu shot prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"But because COVID-19 is a new disease, we do not know if they actually do. ACE inhibitors reportedly increase levels of ACE-2 which is the protein that the SARs-CoV-2 virus binds to, and long-term use may also suppress the immune response. However, an overactive renin-angiotensin system may be another reason people with high blood pressure are more likely to develop pulmonary complications from COVID-19. There is currently no evidence that ACE inhibitors do make COVID-19 worse. But it is something that needs to be investigated further, to help guide practice during this current COVID-19 pandemic and for any new coronaviruses in the future that use ACE-2 as an entry point as well. Do not stop taking your ACE inhibitor because this may increase your chance of having a heart attack or stroke."
Question:Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

22

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Finally, although our study provides an important perspective in COVID-19 care, our findings remain observational. All things considered, our data may suggest that the effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 could be mediated by nicotine rather than whole tobacco smoke. Nicotine can modulate the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (29–31), which SARS-CoV-2 uses for cellular entry (32–34). This in turn modulates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (35). Hence, we hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 alters the control of the nicotine receptor through acetylcholine. This would explain why previous studies also identified an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity (1, 3, 6)."
Question:Can smoking prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

COVID-19 severity not linked to blood type
BackStory
Children and COVID-19
Blood type is not associated with a severe worsening of symptoms in people who have tested positive for COVID-19, according to HMS researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital. Although the findings dispel previous reports suggesting that a certain ABO blood type could lead to increased disease severity, they did indicate that symptomatic individuals with blood types B and AB who are Rh+ are more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than people with other blood types. Symptomatic people with blood type O are less likely to test positive. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred research to ﬁnd characteristics that render individuals more susceptible to the virus, as well as risk factors that intensify its severity and progression. Some have suggested there may be a link between the disease and blood type. The researchers drew upon the Mass General Brigham Research Patient Data Registry to assemble a study population of 1,289 symptomatic adult patients whose blood type had been recorded and who had tested positive for COVID-19."
Question:Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19 The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment for potential reversal of the toxic effects of methanol poisoning. The FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program (please provide the agency with as much information to identify the product as possible):
Complete and submit the report online; or
Download and complete the form, then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178. Consumers, manufacturers or distributors who have questions for the FDA regarding hand sanitizers should email COVID-19-Hand-Sanitizers@fda.hhs.gov. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices."

Why does handwashing with soap work so well to prevent COVID-19? May 18, 2020								
By: Sian White
This article was originally posted on the COVID-19 Hygiene Hub and is updated on an ongoing basis. Handwashing with soap, together with other public health interventions, will be key to curbing the transmission of COVID-19. To understand why handwashing is so effective in killing and removing SARS-CoV-2 it is necessary to understand how soap works at a microscopic level. In the image below the green dot represents some dirt or oil that may be on your hand."

                    In the first few months of the Covid pandemic, doctors treating patients around the world noticed that there were fewer smokers among their most serious cases. Some suggested the nicotine in cigarettes could be slowing down the virus. A hospital in Paris is putting this hypothesis to the test, leading studies using nicotine patches."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The study, co-authored by researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago and the University of Chicago, found that pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol showed a significant negative association with SARS-CoV-2 replication. A new study co-authored by UIC researchers reports evidence that pure, pharmaceutical-grade CBD can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. (Photo: Elsa Olofsson/Unsplash). To study the effect of cannabidiol, commonly called CBD, the researchers first treated human lung cells with a non-toxic dose of CBD for two hours. Then they exposed the cells to SARS-CoV-2 and monitored them for the virus and the viral spike protein, which binds to human cells."
Question:Can Cannabis help COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This recommendation is based on six trials with more than 6000 participants who did not have COVID-19 and received hydroxychloroquine. Using hydroxychloroquine for prevention had little or no effect on preventing illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19. Taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 may increase the risk of diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, drowsiness and headache. More information can be found here. However, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria (not COVID-19). Does WHO recommend hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19?"
Question:Can Hydroxychloroquine worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

28

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"“Early treatment with the monoclonal antibody therapy can reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death, but it will not protect you against catching the virus and the vaccine does just that.”  
What are monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibodies are like the antibodies naturally made by the human body to fight viruses and are designed to target the coronavirus spike protein. When the antibodies bind to the spike protein, they block the virus from entering the body’s cells, which keeps the virus from making copies of itself and continuing to spread within the body. “The monoclonal antibodies protect against severe illness by overwhelming the coronavirus infection while it is still mostly in the nose and throat," said Cohen. “However, the treatment remains limited because it needs to be given within a week after COVID symptoms begin. People may not always know when they were exposed or how long they have been infected.”
The monoclonal antibody therapy is a valuable tool for us when treating COVID-19, but in no way is it a substitute for vaccinations.—Stuart Cohen, chief, Division of Infectious DiseasesWho can get monoclonal antibody treatment?"
Question:Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Although the Kampf et al analysis is a combination of non–COVID-19 studies, we expect the proposed formulation to similarly also disinfect surfaces of the novel coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends an approximately 1:50 dilution to disinfect COVID-19, explicitly noting 5 tablespoons (one-third cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water.4
Different dilutions of sodium hypochlorite can vary in their in vivo fibroblast and keratinocyte cytotoxicity; however, dilutions of ∼0.1% sodium hypochlorite are clinically effective with minimal irritation or sensitization.5 One should be mindful that corrosive injury on mucous membrane/skin contact is possible with excess volumes or mishandling, so appropriate caution and moderation is necessary.6 This solution should ideally be used within 1 month of preparation and stored in a closed, opaque container at room temperature.7
While the exact viral load on inanimate surfaces is unknown during an outbreak, it is critical to disinfect frequently touched surfaces.1 With rapidly diminishing availability of commercial cleaning supplies, simple diluted bleach, which is readily available, can effectively disinfect our clinics, homes, and environment to prevent sustained transmission from inanimate objects. As with many disinfectants, minimizing long-term skin contact and ensuring good ventilation can minimize clinical toxicity. In Henry Dakin's spirit, we should strive to share with our colleagues the cost-effective, accessible, and relatively safe power of diluted bleach.FootnotesFunding sources: None.Conflicts of interest: None disclosed.IRB approval status: Not applicable.References1.

Evidence:"According to Professor Paula Meier and Associate Professor Aloka Patel, in the NICU, mother’s milk is even more important because it reduces the risk of all types of infections. Recent research has shown specific benefits of providing breast milk relevant to the COVID-19 situation. Researchers in China, in USA and in the Netherlands antibodies against the new coronavirus in the milk of mothers who had previously had COVID-19, further supporting the recommendation to continue breastfeeding. We recommend that you discuss with the hospital staff and follow your NICU's specific recommendations and policies on milk expression, labelling, refrigerating or freezing breast milk and transporting it to the NICU. 9: Are COVID-19 antibodies passed via breast milk? Research has shown that there are benefits of providing your breast milk during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Clemency, DO, Professor, Department of Emergency MedicineJacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical SciencesBUFFALO, N.Y. — A national study led by emergency medicine physicians at the University at Buffalo has found that patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are treated with an inhaled steroid are significantly less likely to require emergency department care or hospitalization due to COVID-19 than those treated with placebo. The results of the double-blinded, randomized, controlled study were published Nov. 22  in JAMA Internal Medicine. Participants were enrolled from June through November 2020.A total of 400 patients participated from 10 centers throughout the U.S., with about half receiving treatment and half receiving placebo. Forty-seven patients were from the Buffalo area.Participants treated with ciclesonide did not see faster mitigation of their symptoms —the primary endpoint of the study — than those who received placebo, with both groups seeing resolution of all symptoms on average within 19 days. For this study, COVID-19 symptoms were defined as cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.Fewer emergency department visitsHowever, patients treated with ciclesonide were less likely to require emergency department care or hospitalization for reasons attributable to COVID-19."

Evidence:"Nonetheless, two completed studies have looked at how short-term omega-3 treatments impacted COVID-19 patients:
• In one double-blind clinical trial, the researchers gave 600 mg of EPA/DHA to 128 critically ill COVID-19 patients for 14 days. At the one-month mark, the omega-3 group had significantly better survival rates compared with the control group (21% vs. 3%). It should be noted that some scientists have questioned this study’s approach. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution [14]. • In another study of 2000 COVID-19 patients, the researchers gave 8000 mg of prescription EPA for 3 days and 4000 mg for the rest of the month. The omega-3 intervention trended towards reduced rates of hospitalization and death."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Patients were treated with a variety of experimental agents prior to receiving remestemcel-L. Findings from the study showed 83% survival in ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients with moderate/severe ARDS (n=10/12) following 2 intravenous infusions of remestemcel-L within the first 5 days; 75% of patients (n=9/12) were able to successfully come off ventilator support at a median of 10 days. There have been 7 patients discharged from the hospital as of now. Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr. Silviu Itescu stated: “The remarkable clinical outcomes in these critically ill patients continue to underscore the potential benefits of remestemcel-L as an anti-inflammatory agent in cytokine release syndromes associated with high mortality, including acute graft versus host disease and COVID-19 ARDS. We intend to rapidly complete the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients to rigorously confirm that remestemcel-L improves survival in these critically ill patients.”
