Evidence:"It has long been clear that groups that traditionally exhibit vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, such as older adults and nursing home residents, and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic populations, are the same groups that have also been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, increased time spent indoors due to strict lockdowns and shielding triggered concerns that some people might not obtain the necessary physiological levels of vitamin D from sunlight.On Dec 17, 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in collaboration with Public Health England and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, published an updated rapid review of recent studies on vitamin D and COVID-19. Their recommendations support the current government advice, revised in April, 2020, during the first lockdown in the UK, for everyone to take vitamin D supplements to maintain bone and muscle health during the autumn and winter months. The recommendations are also in line with new guidance from the UK government, released on Dec 22, 2020, allowing extremely clinically vulnerable people to opt in to receive a free 4-month supply of daily vitamin D supplements—similar to an initiative launched earlier in Scotland. However, the rapid review concluded that sufficient evidence to support vitamin D supplementation with the aim of preventing or treating COVID-19 was still lacking and that the topic should be further investigated. Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway."

Evidence:"One of the biggest problems with vitamin C studies is that most do not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Supplementation is unlikely to show an effect in people whose vitamin C levels are already high. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about it. But several studies in other infections or conditions suggest it may be beneficial in certain groups of people, particularly those already deficient in vitamin C who develop COVID-19. Currently, at least two trials are underway specifically investigating the use of vitamin C to treat severe COVID-19, one in New York and one in China. Beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation have been reported for
Elderly people with acute respiratory infections
Recurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome
Reducing the severity and duration of the common cold
Reducing the length of hospital stay and symptoms in elderly patients with pneumonia
Reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation in people in ICU

Dr. Mairani Bratzai, in charge of infection prevention and control (IPC) at the Afghan Japan Hospital, told Pajhwok that the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet commented on the use of saltwater for treatment of the virus. He said gargling salt water was useful for cleaning the throat and preventing the spread of too much infection in the throat, but its usefulness for Covid had not yet been proven and therefore its effectiveness for Covid cannot be confirmed. He urged families and patients with Covid to refrain from using foods and medicines that had not been proven effective. He called on people to go to health centers for better treatment and to be guided by a doctor. Meanwhile, the Iranian American journal of medicine-health has published an article titled: “A few mistakes in preventing the coronariuv that gargling with salt water does not work for Covid-19.”

They are also referred to as female sex hormones.For the study, published in the journal Current Hypertension Reports, the research team conducted a review of published preclinical data on sex-specific hormone activity, especially estrogen. "We know that coronavirus affects the heart and we know that estrogen is protective against cardiovascular disease in women, so the most likely explanation seemed to be hormonal differences between the sexes," said lead author Leanne Groban from the Wake Forest Baptist Health Centre in the US.The researchers said the published literature indicated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), which is attached to cell membranes in the heart, arteries, kidneys and intestines, is the cellular receptor of the coronavirus responsible for Covid-19 infections.AdvertisementIt helps bring the virus into the cells of those organ systems.According to the research team, the review also pointed to estrogen's lowering the level of ACE2 in the heart, which may modulate the severity of Covid-19 in women. Conversely, higher levels of ACE2 in tissues could account for why the symptoms are worse in men than women, the study said.The reasons for the higher male sex-specific Covid-19-related mortality are likely to be multi-fold, including differences in lifestyle (e.g., higher rates of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and innate immunity. "We hope that our review regarding the role of estrogenic hormones in ACE2 expression and regulation may explain the gender differences in Covid-19 infection and outcomes, and serve as a guide for current treatment and the development of new therapies," Groban said.Advertisement"In summary, the accumulating evidence of a somewhat lower rate of Covid-19 disease severity in women needs to be further investigated," the study authors noted. Earlier, several studies revealed that men are more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection.Recently, a study, published in the European Heart Journal, found that men have higher concentrations of ACE2 in their blood than women, a molecule that enables the novel coronavirus to infect healthy cells in men."

Evidence:"“Our study is the first randomized controlled trial exploring whether facial masking prevents COVID-19 transmission at the community level,” Styczynski said. “It’s notable that even though fewer than 50% of the people in the intervention villages wore masks in public places, we still saw a significant risk reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 in these communities, particularly in elderly, more vulnerable people.”
Cloth vs. surgical masks
There were significantly fewer COVID-19 cases in villages with surgical masks compared with the control villages. (Although there were also fewer COVID-19 cases in villages with cloth masks as compared to control villages, the difference was not statistically significant.) This aligns with lab tests showing that surgical masks have better filtration than cloth masks. However, cloth masks did reduce the overall likelihood of experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness during the study period. Bangladesh is a densely populated country in South Asia."

Evidence:"Weathering the Cytokine Storm? Beneficial Mediators Produced by Exposure to UV Light
One of the concerning features of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, which can occur in the second week of the illness. Other related events may be rare inflammatory conditions, such as a Kawasaki-like disease described in older children (i.e., multi-inflammatory syndrome in children; MIS-C), which is characterized by abdominal pain, cardiac dysfunction and shock (149). It is possible that the cascade of anti-inflammatory mediators produced in response to exposure to UV light (13), including nitric oxide (as above) and vitamin D, may act in concert to potentially prevent the COVID-19 cytokine storm and induced inflammation. Indeed, exposure to UV light (and such induced mediators) may reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to COVID-19 cytokine storm events, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (101, 127, 142, 150). Importantly, elevated IL-6 (>70 pg/ml) levels as well as other cytokines (after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities) were associated with reduced survival (HR 2.47, p < 0.0001) of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in New York (USA) (151)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There is currently no evidence to suggest that drinking alcohol by itself raises the risk of COVID-19 infection, provided people are complying with safety recommendations. When people drink excessively and become intoxicated, their inhibitions may be lowered and they may engage in risky behaviours and be less likely to follow guidance around face coverings or comply with social distancing requirements (8, 9).How much you drink can affect your health and ability to fight off infectionFor most people, moderate drinking is compatible with a balanced lifestyle (10). Scientific research has shown moderate drinking isn’t likely to impair your immune response or your ability to fight off disease (6, 11). However, people who drink excessively, particularly over extended periods of time, may have a weaker immune system (13-15) than those who don’t drink at all or do so moderately. Some studies have suggested that the immune response may be lower even immediately following an episode of excessive or binge drinking (16, 17). Experience with other infectious diseases also suggests that extended heavy drinking may interfere with the effectiveness of treatment (13, 15, 17-19).Based on clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people in over 150 testing sites around the world, there is currently no evidence that moderate drinking diminishes the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine."

Evidence:"Critically, this result is consistent across all three regions. Thus, intermediate indoor RH is associated with epidemic deceleration and decreased mortality, while extreme indoor humidity (either low RH or high RH) is associated with epidemic acceleration and increased mortality. The collapse of the regionally variable results into a single trend suggests that intermediate indoor RH could potentially reduce the spread and severity of COVID-19 disease.2.5. Assessing robustness and sensitivity to other factorsSince previous reports have focused on outdoor weather variables, it was important to test whether the results of our study held after controlling for differences in external weather conditions. Here, we stratified the global dataset by outdoor RH, temperature, outdoor absolute humidity (AH) or outdoor ultraviolet radiation (UV). The global dataset was partitioned into upper and lower halves using the median value of a given outdoor weather variable, and a series of common odds ratios were calculated for indoor RH exposure for each stratum."

Evidence:"Based on analysis of symptoms or PCR test results reported in the app, 31,815 of them (19%) ultimately caught COVID-19.We found that people who ate the highest quality diet were around 10% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those with the lowest quality diet, and 40% less likely to become severely ill if they developed COVID-19Importantly, this relationship between diet quality and COVID-19 risk was still there after accounting for age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, smoking, physical activity and underlying health conditions, as well as mask-wearing habits and population density.A smaller recent study showed that people who eat a plant-based or pescatarian diet (predominantly vegetarian but including fish and seafood) are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19. But ours is the first study to show that a higher quality diet actually reduces the chances of developing the disease in the first place.We still don’t know exactly how diet helps to cut the risk from COVID-19, but study co-lead, Professor Andrew Chan MD, MPH from Massachusetts General Hospital, and professor at Harvard Medical School, suspects that inflammation may be playing a role. He says, “Diet quality is an established risk factor for many conditions that are known to have an inflammatory basis. Our study demonstrates that this may also hold true for COVID-19, a virus which is known to provoke a severe inflammatory response.”Who could benefit most from eating a better quality diet?Importantly, we discovered that the impact of diet was amplified by individual life situations, with people living in low-income neighbourhoods and having the lowest quality diet being around 25% more at risk from COVID-19 than people in more affluent communities who were eating in the same way.Based on these results, we’ve calculated that nearly a quarter of COVID-19 cases could have been prevented if these differences in diet quality and wealth had not existed.Dr Sarah Berry, study co-lead and Reader in nutritional sciences at King’s College London, says, “For the first time we’ve been able to show that a healthier diet can cut the chances of catching COVID-19, especially for people living in more deprived areas. Access to healthier food is important to everyone in society, but our findings tell us that helping those living in poorer areas to eat more healthily could have the biggest public health benefits.”‍How can I improve my diet to help protect against COVID-19?Our findings clearly show that eating a plant-rich, ‘gut friendly’ diet is associated with a lower risk from COVID-19. So it makes sense that taking steps to improve the quality of your diet would be a good idea, not just during the pandemic but for your overall health.Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist at ZOE COVID Study and professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, says, “You don’t have to go vegan, but getting more diverse plants on your plate is a great way to boost the health of your gut microbiome, improve your immunity and overall health, and potentially reduce your risk from COVID-19.”This doesn’t have to be difficult or expensive - check out our ten top tips for getting more plants on your plate if you’re looking for some fresh (or frozen!)"

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Many children have not been exposed to influenza following two years of low influenza rates due to public health measures put in place to prevent COVID-19. This is why it’s especially important for children to get vaccinated against influenza now. Children, especially those under the age of 5, and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or heart disease, are at high risk of severe illness or complications from influenza, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. To prevent serious illness, get your child vaccinated against influenza as soon as possible. Children 2 to 17 can get the nasal spray influenza vaccine instead of the vaccine given by injection if they prefer. It's safe for your child to get their influenza vaccine at the same time as other vaccines."

Evidence:"What is the "suspected" connection? There are animal studies that suggest angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which the virus uses to enter cells, may be increased in certain parts of the body as a result of taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB. No firm conclusions about COVID-19 can be drawn from these studies, which did not involve humans, viral infection or the lungs, the most commonly affected organ impacted by COVID-19. Early reports suggested that people who did worse after contracting COVID-19 often had high blood pressure. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from that observation since older patients often have high blood pressure and tend to do worse if they acquire COVID-19."

Evidence:"And the eternal question: Will we ever be free from it? Could factors such as blood type play a role in making people susceptible to the disease? In this sense, a multicentre study recently published by IVI and presented at the latest edition of the ASRM (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) Congress, one of the world's largest congresses on Reproductive Medicine, shows that patients with O positive blood group and Rh positive have greater protection against COVID-19. “In the data analysed in our population in the post-confinement period from May to June, with a sample of 6,140 patients for SARS-CoV-2, we found that the incidence of disease (understood as patients who had positive antibodies, either IgM or IgG) was lower in patients with group O, with significant findings that the Rh-negative group was more frequent among those infected, contrary to what had been previously published.”, said Dr. Antonio Requena, IVI Medical Director. “The positive rate does not vary significantly with age and no differences were observed in terms of gender or blood group. However, Rh-negative individuals were found to have a slightly higher risk of infection than Rh-positive individuals."

Evidence:"Myths about alcohol and COVID-19
There is a misinformation belief that drinking alcohol (methanol) will somehow cure or prevent being infected by COVID-19. Consuming alcohol will not kill the virus, but its consumption will likely increase health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus. Alcohol (at a concentration of at least 60% by volume) works as a disinfectant on your skin. However, it has no such function within your system when it is taken orally. There is also misinterpretation saying that drinking alcohol kills the virus in the inhaled air. We should be clear that the consumption of alcohol will not kill the virus in the inhaled air."

Evidence:"WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum and patches are designed to help smokers quit tobacco. WHO recommends that smokers take immediate steps to quit by using proven methods such as toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging programmes, and nicotine replacement therapies.

Evidence:"Photograph:(Others)Follow UsStory highlights"We don't know yet if CBD can prevent COVID, but we think our results provide a strong case for conducting a clinical trial. That's really our mantra: We want a clinical trial," Rosner told Live Science
Researchers have revealed that cannabidiol (CBD), which is an active ingredient found in cannabis might help block infection with the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been established after the laboratory studies that CBD has shown promising results, however, further investigation is needed to produce a concrete result as the possible effect still needs to be tested on humans.It should be noted that many potential COVID-19 treatments that showed promise in test tubes have not worked or benefitted researchers during Covid studies/trials.

Evidence:"Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce symptom duration (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.49–1.21). Recruitment was paused on May 22, 2020, when a since-retracted publication raised concerns about the safety of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although we had not identified concerns in a safety review, enrolment was slower than expected among those eligible for the study, and cases within the community were decreasing. Recruitment goals were deemed to be unattainable and the trial was not resumed, resulting in a study underpowered to assess the effect of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and safety.Interpretation: There was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced symptom duration or prevented severe outcomes among outpatients with proven COVID-19, but the early termination of our study meant that it was underpowered.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04329611Eighteen years ago, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience1–5 highlighted limited knowledge of early treatments for novel pandemic respiratory viruses.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It’s called monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. Some early evidence suggests that mAb treatment can reduce the amount of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19) in a person's system. This amount is known as viral load. Having a lower viral load means you may have milder symptoms thereby decreasing the chance of you needing to stay in the hospital. There are several COVID-19 treatment options available for those who have tested positive and are experiencing symptoms:
Paxlovid is authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Veklury is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, who are not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death."

Viral vector vaccines
For decades, scientists studied viral vector vaccines. Some vaccines recently used for Ebola outbreaks have used viral vector technology, and a number of studies have focused on viral vector vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Zika, flu, and HIV. Scientists used this technology to make COVID-19 vaccines as well. Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus as a vector to deliver protection. Several different viruses have been used as vectors, including influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus, and adenovirus, which causes the common cold."

COVID-19 is known to cause severe respiratory illness in some individuals. Studies have shown that some corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, could reduce the inflammation of the respiratory tract in these patients and benefit them by alleviating the symptoms of severe disease. Researchers in this new trial are studying if the steroid inhalers used for reducing the exacerbations of asthma could be useful for patients with early COVID-19 and reduce their risk of severe disease. The paradox
Lead researcher on this team Dan Nicolau, an associate professor at QUT, explained that the asthmatics and those with chronic lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were on regular inhaler therapy with corticosteroids, were found to have a lesser risk of severe illness in the early phase of the pandemic. He said that this was paradoxical because those with long term lung disease were initially considered to be at a higher risk of a respiratory viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2."

Intravenous treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in elderly hospitalised patients in intensive care due to COVID-19 seems to have positive effects on the ability of the immune system to cope with the virus, according to a study from Karolinska Institutet. In the future, the study, published in the journal Clinical and Translational Medicine, could lead to a complementary, cost-effective treatment for COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19, a result of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system and the body’s activation of white blood cells are over-activated. It can lead to a so-called systemic inflammatory storm, which worsens the disease state and can cause complications such as sepsis and heart failure. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet, among others, have now shown that omega-3 fatty acids can stimulate active healing of inflammation, without inhibiting the immune response. By accelerating the healing of the inflammation without compromising the body’s immune system, it could be possible to counteract the most serious complications of COVID-19, researchers believe."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The benefit of IVIg in severe and critically ill COVID-19 is not well understood, however several studies suggest that it targets the post-infectious inflammatory response of the cytokine storm by scavenging complement, regulating effector T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and regulatory T-cells while inhibiting host innate immune cell activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Its action to reduce elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory markers of inflammation early in the course of COVID-19 illness is consistent with downregulation of the immune response. While current batches of IVIg may neutralize seasonal coronavirus species, it generally lacks cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [20]. Although passive virus neutralization appears to not be responsible for the beneficial effects of IVIg in treating COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 encodes one superantigen motif near its S1/S2 cleavage site that might trigger the cytokine storm [21]. As IVIg contains antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [22], IVIg might inhibit superantigen-mediated T-cell activation, cytokine release and an incipient cytokine storm. 3."

While at present there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it may be possible that people can become infected by touching a surface or object contaminated by the virus and then touching their face. The higher risk though, comes from being in close contact with other people while food shopping or receiving a food delivery. As always, good hygiene is important when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses. Remove any unnecessary packaging and dispose into a waste bin with a lid. Packaging like cans can be wiped clean with a disinfectant before being opened or stored.
