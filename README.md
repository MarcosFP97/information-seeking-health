# Evaluation of LLMs for Answering Binary Health Related Questions

This repository contains a thorough evaluation of different LLMs for answering binary health-related questions. We used TREC HM datasets as benchmarks.

## NOTES!!!:

- This repositroy is constantly evolving and updating due to the appearance of new LLMs or potential improvements on the prompting strategies.
- It is also important to notice that, since the accuracy was **manually revised**, it could happen that the printed accuracy in the log does not correspond with the real accuracy. To obtain the real accuracy, reported in the paper, you need to count the number of hits in each log file (the test McNemar file can help with that).
