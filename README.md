# Evaluation of Generative Models Reliability to Answer Binary Health Related Questions

This repository contains the code and results from the experiments reported in the paper "*Large Language Models for Binary Health-Related Question Answering: A Zero- and Few-Shot Evaluation*''.

## Important notes

- It is also important to notice that, since the accuracy was **manually revised**, it could happen that the printed accuracy in the log does not correspond with the real accuracy. To obtain the real accuracy, reported in the paper, you need to count the number of hits in each log file (the test McNemar file can help with that).
