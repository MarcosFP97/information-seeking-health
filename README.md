# Search engines, LLMs and RAG experiments for seeking health information

This repository contains a thorough evaluation of different LLMs for answering binary health-related questions. We used TREC HM datasets as benchmarks.

## NOTE:

- This repositroy is constantly evolving and updating due to the appearance of new LLMs or potential improvements on the prompting strategies.
