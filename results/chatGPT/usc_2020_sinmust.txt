Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?


there has been some speculation that certain medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), may worsen covid-19 symptoms. however, current evidence suggests that these medications are not harmful in the context of covid-19 and may even be beneficial for some patients.

ace inhibitors and arbs are commonly used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and other cardiovascular conditions. they work by blocking the action of a hormone called angiotensin ii, which can cause blood vessels to narrow and blood pressure to rise.

early in the pandemic, there was concern that these medications could increase the risk of severe covid-19 symptoms because the virus enters cells through a protein called ace2, which is related to the enzymes targeted by ace inhibitors and arbs. however, subsequent research has found no evidence to support this theory. in fact, some studies have suggested that ace inhibitors and arbs may reduce the severity of covid-19 by blocking the harmful effects of angiotensin ii and promoting the activity of protective angiotensin peptides.

it is important to note that every patient is different, and the decision to continue or discontinue any medication should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider who can take into account the individual's medical history, current condition, and other relevant factors. if you have concerns about your medications and covid-19, you should talk to your doctor.
