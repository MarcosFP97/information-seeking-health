Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (usually HSV-1). Although less common, HSV-1 can be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact, causing genital herpes. However, genital herpes is more commonly caused by HSV-2. It's essential to practice safe sex and avoid contact with cold sores to minimize the risk of transmission.
