No, getting a flu shot cannot prevent COVID-19. The flu shot is designed to protect against influenza viruses, not the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It is still important to get the flu shot, as it can help prevent severe illness and complications from the flu. To protect yourself against COVID-19, get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you, and continue to practice preventive measures like wearing masks, social distancing, and washing your hands frequently.
23


Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?
I am not a medical expert, but I can try to provide you with some general information.

There has been some discussion in the medical community about whether ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might increase the risk or worsen the outcomes of COVID-19 infection. This concern arose because the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, uses a cellular enzyme called ACE2 to enter human cells. ACE inhibitors and ARBs can increase the levels of ACE2 in the body, theoretically making it easier for the virus to infiltrate cells.

However, recent studies and guidance from professional medical organizations, including the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology, have concluded that there is not enough evidence to support discontinuing ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with COVID-19 or at risk for the infection. They recommend that patients should not discontinue these medications unless specifically advised by their healthcare provider.

It's important to note that research on COVID-19 is ongoing, and our understanding of the virus and its interactions with various medications may change over time. You should consult with a healthcare professional for advice specific to your situation.
24

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?
There is no scientific evidence to suggest that smoking can prevent COVID-19. In fact, smoking can have negative impacts on your health, particularly on your lung and heart function, which could potentially make you more susceptible to severe outcomes if you contract the virus. It is important to follow public health guidelines and take proper precautions such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and getting vaccinated to protect yourself from COVID-19.
25


Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19?
Having type O blood does not prevent COVID-19. While some studies have suggested that people with type O blood may have a slightly lower risk of infection and severe illness, it is essential to understand that individuals with any blood type can contract the virus. It is crucial for everyone, regardless of blood type, to take preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and following good hand hygiene.
26

Can methanol prevent COVID-19?

However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for the most accurate and up-to-date information concerning any potential treatments for COVID-19.


Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?
Monoclonal antibodies are a type of treatment being developed and studied for COVID-19. While they are not considered a "cure" for the virus, they have shown promise in reducing the severity of illness and shortening the duration of symptoms in some patients, particularly when administered early in the course of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made molecules that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful viruses. For COVID-19, these antibodies are engineered to target the spike protein of the coronavirus, helping to neutralize the virus and potentially prevent it from entering human cells.

It is important to note that monoclonal antibodies should be used under the guidance of healthcare professionals, and their effectiveness can vary from person to person. They are one part of a larger strategy in preventing and treating COVID-19, which includes vaccination, testing, and following public health guidelines.


Can bleach prevent COVID-19?
No, bleach should not be ingested or used on the human body to prevent COVID-19. Bleach is a powerful disinfectant and can be effective in cleaning surfaces to remove the virus, but it is toxic if ingested or used inappropriately.

It is derived from mesenchymal stem cells, which have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Some clinical trials have shown promise in reducing inflammation and lung damage in patients with severe COVID-19. However, it's important to note that Remestemcel-L is not a "cure" for COVID-19, and more research is needed to determine its full potential and effectiveness in treating the disease.
34

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?
There is currently no evidence to suggest that mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus primarily spreads through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It is best to maintain good hygiene practices, wear masks, and practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
35


Can Homemade Vodka Sanitizer prevent COVID-19?
Homemade vodka sanitizer is not a recommended solution for preventing COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to effectively kill the virus. Most vodka has an alcohol content of around 40%, which is not sufficient to inactivate the virus. It is much safer and more effective to use commercially available hand sanitizers that meet the recommended alcohol content or to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
36
