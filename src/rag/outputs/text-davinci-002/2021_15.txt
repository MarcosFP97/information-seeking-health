Evidence:"An Achilles tendonitis boot that supports the foot and encloses the ankle and lower calf can provide even more stability while restricting movement that may be injuring or re-injuring the Achilles tendon. This along with Achilles tendonitis braces can be helpful for post-operative use following an Achilles tendonitis tear, as well. Heel Lifts for Achilles Tendonitis
As you may have inferred from the previous Achilles tendonitis ankle brace talk, shoe inserts for Achilles tendonitis can also be helpful for easing the strain on the Achilles tendon and the pain associated with the formation of any bone spurs as a side effect. These heel pads for Achilles tendonitis lift the heel, diminishing any strain on the Achilles tendon, itself. Compression socks for Achilles tendonitis are another treatment and prevention option. Similar to the wraps or taping recommended as a home treatment for Achilles tendonitis, these can help prevent or reduce swelling of the foot and ankle."
Question:Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"While chicken soup helps adults suffering from fever, Dr Ramachandran explains that while it may reduce the dehydrating effects of fever, it won’t help put an end to your child’s fever. 3) Give bubba a sponge or lukewarm bath Keep the bathwater lukewarm — between 32 and 35 deg C. Don’t use cold water thinking that it’ll bring down your child’s fever as a too drastic drop in body temperature could send his body into shock. 4) Dress him in “breathable” clothes Don’t put your little one in heat-trapping garments made of cotton-blend and polyester materials. Pure cotton fabrics will cool his body as the natural fibres help air to circulate. 5) Improve ventilation by opening windows and using the fan Keep a fan oscillating at a low speed to circulate clean air around the room. You don’t want to blow air directly at bubba, which could cause discomfort and worse, may worsen his condition."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Many people mistakenly apply ice to burns because it feels soothing, but ice can cause more harm than good in burn cases. Ice should not be applied to burns as it may cause nerve damage and frostbite, especially with more severe burns where the nerve may already be exposed. Using ice after the initial burn may slow the healing the process further and cause more damage to the surrounding skin. Instead of ice, run cold water over the burn for several minutes following the initial burn. If you are unsure of first aid after a burn, it is always best to seek medical attention."

Evidence:"This increases your metabolism, requiring more energy and therefore calories. Needless to say, it’s a bad idea to starve a fever, as it leaves you low on energy and nutrients, making it more difficult for your body to fend off the virus. This is important for everyone, but even more so for young children, elderly people or anyone with an underlying condition such as asthma, diabetes or cancer. While no single food will magically cure you, eating certain foods can ease cold and flu symptoms and provide energy and nutrients to help you recover faster. So, what exactly should you eat when you have a cold or the flu? Feed a cold (and the flu): what to eat to aid recovery
Drink plenty of fluids
Your body needs extra fluids to replace any water and nutrients lost through sweating (which is likely if you have a fever)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Usually, people with a balanced and healthy diet have sufficient quantities of zinc and do not require supplements. Being aware of the power of zinc and how it impacts areas such as fertility is important and heightens awareness of the value of a nutritious diet. How Zinc Affects Fertility
In fertility, zinc regulates the hormone functions that ensure ovulation is regular and so helps conception.1 A woman is more likely to conceive if her monthly periods are regular. Zinc is also important for men as it helps with healthy sperm formation. It also supports the development of healthy epithelial tissue in the reproductive system which enables conception.2 Zinc deficiency in men results in a drop in sperm count and also lowers testosterone levels.3
Research shows that it is important to plan for pregnancy and ensure that the body is as healthy as possible prior to conception as zinc levels affect the egg in the very early days of cell development as it divides. Being aware of this issue helps prospective parents prepare ahead to create the best possible conditions for a pregnancy to occur."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This four-year trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) aimed to compare cast to functional brace in the treatment of individuals with an ankle fracture. Ankle fractures are very common and tend to occur when you land on your foot and twist it. They are most commonly related to sports, traffic accidents or falls in older people, though it is an injury that everyone is susceptible to. Not all ankle fractures will require surgery, but in all cases patients will need to keep their foot immobilised typically for a period of around 6 weeks to allow the bones to heal. As part of the AIR trial, 669 patients were randomly given either a cast (334 patients) or removable brace (335 patients) to immobilise their foot following an ankle fracture. Those with the brace were given information advising them to take the boot off around three times a day and perform repetitions of ankle movement exercises."
Question:Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Dairy foods, soy products, grains, seafood, and fortified foods are good dietary sources of calcium (44). The biological mechanisms between dietary calcium and magnesium intake and migraine were not fully understood but may be related to the following mechanisms. Magnesium may prevent migraine by inhibiting neuronal overexcitation, counteracting vasospasm, and reducing the formation of inflammatory mediators, as well as improving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, serotonin receptor transmission, and the NO system (12–14). Calcium and magnesium, which are involved in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators, may work together to help the nervous system function properly and relieve nerve tension (10, 11). Our results support the positive role of magnesium and calcium in migraine, the only difference being that we did not find an effect of magnesium on migraine in men. We speculate that this might be due to significantly higher ionized magnesium levels in the muscles of men than in women (45)."
Question:Can magnesium help prevent migraine? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Our finding of lower HRs and fasting plasma glucose levels in T2D patients during ingestion of fermented milk needs further validation.IntroductionClinical and experimental studies carried out in spontaneously hypertensive rats have reported that biologically active peptides derived from fermented milk has a blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects (1, 2). Most of the studies examined the tripeptides isoleucine–proline–proline and valine–proline–proline released by degradation of milk proteins (especially casein) during fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus (1). The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of milk peptides is mainly supposed to be the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by the tripeptides (1). ACE is important in the regulation of BP by converting angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin, thereby increasing the BP.Even a small decrease in BP may be associated with a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Thus, a recent study has shown that a decrease of 5.6 mmHg in systolic BP (SBP) and 2.2 mmHg in diastolic BP (DBP) reduced the relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event by 9% (3). A recent Cochrane review including 15 intervention studies has only found a modest decrease of 2.45 mmHg in SBP with no effect of fermented milk on DBP, thus the authors did not support the use of fermented milk to reduce BP in hypertension (4)."
Question:Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"Eczema is a skin condition that’s most common in children, but it can also continue into adulthood.To treat eczema, Dupixent can be used alone or with corticosteroids applied to the skin.Moderate to severe asthmaDupixent is used as an add-on treatment for certain types of asthma in adults and children ages 6 years and older. (As an add-on treatment, it’s used together with one or more other medications.) These types of asthma include:eosinophilic asthma, which is asthma associated with high levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bodyasthma that must be treated with corticosteroids taken by mouth, such as prednisoneAsthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes inflammation (swelling) and narrowing of your airways. Symptoms of asthma can include:wheezingshortness of breathfeeling of tightness in your chestcoughingincreased mucusCertain triggers, such as exercise or cold weather, can cause asthma symptoms to suddenly become severe. This is called an asthma attack.It’s important to note that Dupixent should not be used to treat an asthma attack. Instead, you should use a rescue inhaler to ease asthma attack symptoms."

Evidence:""Arthritis, the leading cause of disability, affects 1 in 5 adults, most of whom are under 65 years of age. Without proper management, arthritis affects not only mobility, but also overall health and well-being, participation in valued activities and quality of life. There is no cure for arthritis, but one important way to manage arthritis is to remain active. Yet up to 90% of people with arthritis are less active than public health guidelines suggest, perhaps due to arthritis symptoms such as pain and stiffness, but also because they are unsure of how best to remain active.The study recruited 75 people with either knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to either a wait list or eight weeks of twice-weekly yoga classes, plus a weekly practice session at home. Participants' physical and mental wellbeing was assessed before and after the yoga session by researchers who did not know which group the participants had been assigned to.Compared with the control group, those doing yoga reported a 20% improvement in pain, energy levels, mood and physical function, including their ability to complete physical tasks at work and home."

      Before committing to purchasing one of these lights you may be asking, “What is SAD, anyway?” Seasonal affective disorder is basically defined as a bout of depression during the same time frame each year for at least two years in a row, followed by remission during the remaining months, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Women and people who live in areas that see less daylight in the winter months seem to be more affected than others, according to the National Institutes of Health. If that sounds anything like you, the next logical question may be “Can a SAD lamp help?” Since 1984 when it was first researched, bright light therapy (BLT) has proven to improve those winter doldrums again and again. Enter the SAD lamp."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"ConclusionsGlucosamine and chondroitin sulfate alone or in combination did not reduce pain effectively in the overall group of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Exploratory analyses suggest that the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may be effective in the subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00032890.) IntroductionOsteoarthritis is the most common of the arthritides, affecting at least 20 million Americans, a number that is expected to double over the next two decades.1,2 Currently available medical therapies primarily address the treatment of joint pain in patients with osteoarthritis.3 Analgesics as well as traditional and cyclooxygenase-2–selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have suboptimal effectiveness,4,5 and there is some question about their safety, especially in the light of recent reports of increased cardiovascular risk.6-8 The dietary supplements glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been advocated, especially in the lay media, as safe and effective options for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating the efficacy of these supplements for osteoarthritis9 suggested potential benefit from these agents but raised questions about the scientific quality of the studies. We conducted the Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and celecoxib-controlled, multicenter trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, to evaluate rigorously the efficacy and safety of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and the two in combination in the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee."

Evidence:"Something dermatologists see often in their practice is patients who have spent hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on ineffective treatments. In the case of minoxidil, you don’t have to spend a fortune to see thicker, more dense hair with increased growth. The ingredient cannot cure androgenetic alopecia (sadly nothing can) but it certainly can delay hair loss from getting worse. Effective hair loss treatment requires expert advice to ensure you understand your type of hair loss (there are many), an expert-led treatment plan and some supportive guidance. Minoxidil is a relatively affordable solution since you can get it easily over-the-counter and is completely noninvasive — unlike microneedling and hair transplants, for example. To help you get the lowdown on everything you need to know about minoxidil for hair loss, we called in top dermatologists to help break down the ingredient, including how to use it, how much it costs, and the potential benefits and risks of minoxidil.In this Story: What is minoxidil?How does minoxidil work?What are the benefits of using minoxidil?Who is a good candidate for minoxidil?How do you use minoxidil for hair loss?What is oral minoxidil, and is it safe?What are the potential risks to using topical minoxidil?Minoxidil: Pros & ConsMeet the experts:Corey L.

Evidence:"Proof that such representation in the case of at least nine of the persons represented as cured was false establishes the falsity of such representation in a most significant particular. Furthermore, as we have held, the overwhelming weight of the credible evidence requires a conclusion that the representation that the Hoxsey liquid medicines are efficacious in the cure of cancer is likewise false and misleading. The evidence as a whole does not support the finding of the trial Court that "some it cures, and some it does not cure, and some it relieves somewhat." We do not attempt to set ourselves up as arbiters of what method of treatment the Hoxsey Clinic shall employ. We are not authorized by law to do so. It is our duty to adjudge the merits of the case in the light of the provisions and intent of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, supra, which close the channels of interstate commerce against drugs which are misbranded."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"GABA’s primary role is to aid relaxation without sedation and some studies suggest that it can further limit the stress response by reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle contraction [4]. A clinical trial showed that 200mg of L-theanine significantly reduced subjective stress responses to multitasking cognitive stressors compared to placebo and saliva cortisol levels were also lowered 3 hours post-ingestion [5]. Clinical evidence has shown that L-theanine can amplify alpha brain waves which are associated with a state of relaxation and alertness, often referred to as a “wakeful relaxation” [6]. Another study showed that oral ingestion of 200mg L-theanine increased brain levels after 30 minutes and peaked at 5 hours [7]. Similar results of increased alpha waves were noted in those with high levels of trait anxiety, upon 200 mg L-theanine intake [13]. A review of 9 studies found that regular intake of 200-400 mg/day of L-theanine has a beneficial effect on stress and anxiety [14]."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"But while exercise is not a perfect solution for depression, studies have shown that it can make a difference. One 2018 review of studies found that physical activity — specifically resistance training, like weight-lifting — can reduce symptoms of depression, perhaps even as effectively as conventional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and medication for some people. Other studies have found that virtually any type of workout, from cardio to yoga, can lessen depressive symptoms. It’s still unclear how exercise may achieve these effects, but researchers have theories. Rigorous workouts, like weight-lifting and running, may increase blood flow to the brain, potentially altering its structure and cellular makeup. Exercise can also trigger the release of mood-boosting endorphins."
Question:Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"Incorrect Tick RemovalWhen removing a tick, you don’t want to upset it so that it vomits its stomach contents into the bloodstream via the hypostome.If you distress the tick during removal, 1 of 2 unfortunate things can happen:The mouthparts get left in the skin.Or the tick injects its parasite-laden gut contents into the pet’s bloodstream.Some of the urban myths for tick removal actually do much more harm than good. These myths include:Smearing the tick with Vaseline to suffocate itBurning the tick with a cigaretteSoaking the tick in rubbing alcoholAttaching cotton to the tick and pullingTwisting the tick (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the myth) to removePicking it off with fingernailsThe only thing any of those techniques above do is distress the tick — with potentially serious consequences.How to Remove a Tick From a Dog — The Right WayInstructions for safely removing a tick from a dog:Use a pair of fine-toothed tweezers or a tick-removing hook (check the tool’s instructions for effective removal).If necessary, wet the dog’s fur so that you can see the tick more clearly.Wear latex gloves — some of the infections caused by ticks are transmissible to people, and you could become infected via a skin scratch.If you’re using tweezers, grasp the tick exactly where it meets the skin. Do not grasp the body directly — this could squeeze it and push toxins into the pet.Pull sharply backward to remove the tick (no twisting involved).If you grip too high up, you may snap off the mouthparts, leaving them in the skin. These can cause irritation and the development of a tissue lump called a tick granuloma. The granuloma may need to be with antibiotics or even be surgically removed.Don’t take chances with ticks. Use a preventive but also check your pet daily, and keep tweezers or a tick hook handy to deal with these pesky critters straight away."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"RecommendedNo.202 - Prevent Elasticity Damage
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that mayonnaise may help eliminate head lice. However, there is no scientific proof of its efficacy. Mayonnaise, popularly known as mayo, combines vegetable oils, vinegar, and egg yolk and is a perfect accompaniment to nachos, fries, burgers, and sandwiches. However, full-fat mayonnaise is often used to kill head lice. One possible reason is that mayonnaise works as a suffocating agent when applied liberally and left for over 12 hours. However, it cannot eliminate the nits that may stay in the hair for six months and cause re-infestation (1)."
Question:Can applying mayonnaise help get rid of lice? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"However, an even partially effective treatment for treating and preventing the common cold could markedly reduce the health problems and economic losses associated with it. Zinc inhibits replication of the virus and has been tested in trials for treatment of the common cold. This review identified 18 randomised controlled trials, enrolling 1781 participants of all age groups, comparing zinc with placebo (no zinc). We found that zinc (lozenges or syrup) reduces the average duration of the common cold in healthy people, when taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. In people taking zinc their cold symptoms are also less likely to persist beyond seven days of treatment. Prophylactic zinc supplementation for at least five months reduces incidence, school absences and prescription of antibiotics for children with the common cold, although antibiotics are not required for the common cold."
Question:Can zinc help treat the common cold? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Interest in the possibility that probiotics might help or prevent this type of diarrhea has grown in recent years, resulting in a proliferation of individual studies. Researchers from the RAND-based Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to find studies that examined whether probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Researchers pooled results from the studies together to gain a clearer understanding of whether probiotics can prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Use of probiotics was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of developing diarrhea when taking antibiotics as compared to not using probiotics. The RAND analysis estimates that 13 people would need to use probiotics in order to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, researchers say the evidence was insufficient to show which type of microorganism was better than another because the included strains were poorly documented and often given as blends of several types."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Subjects: 10 RCTs including 1712 patients with either symptomatic OA of the knee (6 trials) or hip/knee (3 trials) or multiple joints (1 trial). Main outcome measures: (a) effect size (ES) for pain, stiffness, and functional scores from baseline to end point; (b) rate ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for clinical response rate and patient preference for treatment. Results: Paracetamol was effective in relieving pain due to OA (ES = 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.41). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were better than paracetamol for pain relief (ES = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30). Clinical response rate was higher with NSAIDs than with paracetamol (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.41), and the number of patients who preferred NSAIDs was more than twice the number of those preferring paracetamol (RR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.12). NSAIDs were associated with more frequent gastrointestinal discomfort than paracetamol (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In bipolar disorder (manic depression), the omega-3s may be most effective for the depressed phase rather than the manic phase of the illness. The omega-3s have also been proposed to alleviate or prevent other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit disorder. However, there is still not enough evidence to recommend the omega-3s in these conditions. What dose of omega-3s is beneficial? Doses for depression range from less than 1 g/day to 10 g/day, but most studies use doses between 1 and 2 g/day. In my practice, I recommend 1 to 2 g/day of an EPA+DHA combination, with at least 60% EPA, for major depression."

Evidence:"What the researchers could not say is how vitamin D is meant to influence asthma symptoms. Similarly, a 2017 review in Clinical Therapy reported that low levels of vitamin D correspond to a higher rate of asthma attacks. Even so, there was no evidence that vitamin D supplements could either prevent or treat asthma. Recap
Although some research suggests that vitamin D supplements may benefit people with asthma, the evidence supporting the claim is weak. There is no evidence that vitamin D can prevent asthma. How Vitamin D Deficiency and Allergies Are Linked

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The first author is Margaret A. Adgent, MSPH, PhD, formerly of NIEHS, now at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Adgent said, “Modern soy formula has been used safely for decades. However, our observational study found subtle effects in estrogen-responsive tissues in soy-fed infants, and we don’t know if these differences are associated with long-term health effects.”
Some mothers who don’t breastfeed have long used soy formula as an alternative to cow-milk formula, often from concerns about milk allergies, lactose intolerance, or other feeding difficulties. However, soy protein contains high amounts of genistein, an estrogen-like compound. Like other estrogen-mimicking chemicals found in the environment, genistein can alter the body’s endocrine system and potentially interfere with normal hormonal development. In laboratory studies genistein causes abnormal reproductive development and function in rodents, but little is known about its effects on infants."
Question:Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no
