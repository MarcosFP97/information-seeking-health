Evidence:"Neuropsychological tests were administered, and folate, homocysteine, vitamin B12, IL-6, TNF-α, Aβ-42, and Aβ-40 were measured at baseline and at 6- and 12-month time points.152 participants (folic acid: 77, conventional: 75) completed the trial. Significant improvements in folate (ηp2 = 0.703, P = 0.011), homocysteine (ηp2 = 0.644, P = 0.009), Aβ-42 (ηp2 = 0.687, P = 0.013), peripheral IL-6 (ηp2 = 0.477, P = 0.025), TNF-α (ηp2 = 0.709, P = 0.009) levels were observed in folic acid group compared with conventional group. Folic acid supplementation improved the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (P = 0.028; effect size d = 0.153), Information (P = 0.031; d = 0.157) and Digit Span (P = 0.009; d = 0.172) scores at 12 months compared with conventional treatment. Based on these findings, daily oral administration of a 400-μg folic acid supplement to MCI subjects for 12 months can significantly improve cognitive performance and reduce peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels.

Evidence:"Therefore, it can take a while for warts to resolve on their own.Duct tape wart removal may help people get rid of warts more quickly, but this method requires frequent and repeated applications of duct tape, which can be difficult to keep up.For this reason, some people might prefer other home remedies or medical treatment options.In this article, we explain how to perform duct tape wart removal. We also discuss other ways to remove warts.Does it work?Share on PinterestPeople must use repeated applications of duct tape to remove a wart with this method.Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work for several reasons. One theory is that the tape deprives the skin cells of oxygen. By “suffocating” the wart, the duct tape makes it more likely that the skin cells will die.The process of applying and removing the duct tape may also remove additional skin cells, which can make the wart less bulky and noticeable.However, there is a lack of recent research into using duct tape as a wart removal treatment, and earlier studies have produced mixed results.One 2002 study found that the duct tape method was significantly more effective than cryotherapy, which involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The study included 51 participants ages 3–22.They received either up to six sessions of cryotherapy, which took place every 2–3 weeks, or 2 months of duct tape application. Warts resolved entirely in 85% of the participants in the duct tape group and in 60% of those in the cryotherapy group.However, a 2007 study into using adhesive pads to treat warts found that adding duct tape to a breathable fabric called moleskin made no difference to its effectiveness."

Evidence:"Vitamin D is probably the most common, because many of us are deficient in this vitamin, and vitiligo patients may be more so because of their need to avoid the sun to prevent burning of their sensitive white spots. But this doesn’t mean that their low vitamin D caused, or is even affecting, their vitiligo, and supplementing their vitamin D may be a good idea for their overall health, but is unlikely to help their vitiligo. Some have heard that vitiligo is partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in melanocytes, you can read more about that here. So some believe that taking antioxidants should help the disease, and many dermatologists recommend this for their patients. However it is important to remember that no matter how much things seem to make sense, we can’t know for sure if this approach will help vitiligo until they’re tested in clinical trials. Another example is supplementing vitamin B12 – this vitamin is more commonly deficient in vitiligo patients compared to the general population."

Evidence:"The following article will cover the relationship between ovarian cysts and hormonal birth control. How can birth control prevent ovarian cysts from forming? Taking hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD, can be an effective method in preventing ovarian cysts from forming. Combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progesterone, are the most effective at blocking ovulation. The mini-pill, which contains only progestin, has an unpredictable effect on ovulation and is, therefore, less effective at preventing cysts from forming. Individuals who skip their periods while on birth control further decrease their likelihood of developing cysts."

Evidence:"There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits. Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations in impoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrient and or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be an urgent priority.Plain language summaryZinc supplementation for improving pregnancy and infant outcomeTaking zinc during pregnancy helps to slightly reduce preterm births, but does not prevent other problems such as low birthweight babies.Many women of childbearing age may have mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc concentrations may cause preterm birth or they may even prolong labour. It is also possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well. This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, involving over 17,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementation has a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does not help to prevent low birthweight babies compared with not giving zinc supplements before 27 weeks of pregnancy. One trial did not contribute data."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Benefits Of An Ankle Brace
In general, an ankle brace keeps your foot and toes pointed forward and prevents inward rotation or twisting of the foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains (stretching and tearing of ligaments, tendons, and other soft tissue) occur with sudden twisting or rotation of the ankle joint as you step off a curb or stair, or run on a bumpy, uneven surface. When an ankle injury occurs, coaches, primary care physicians, orthopaedic specialists, and podiatrists often advise patients to wear ankle braces for joint support and to prevent further injury. Bracing also limits the development of scar tissue and arthritis and reduces both acute and chronic pain. An ankle brace is an adjunctive tool after casting, surgery, physical therapy, exercise, targeted training, and other kinds of medical interventions. Your podiatrist in South Texas may advise an ankle brace in these situations:
Ankle fracture
Hindfoot fracture
Ankle sprain and repeated ankle sprains
Ankle instability due to arthritis, sprains, and obesity
Poor balance
Dysfunctional gait, such as toeing in or repeated inward rotation of the ankle joint
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis
Gout
Achilles tendonitis
Avoiding or postponing ankle fusion or replacement surgery due to advanced arthritis

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"One of the most popular is vitamin E, which is found in many skin creams. But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. "People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not," Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it "a proven scientific fact" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also "nonsense", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. "People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars," Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen."

no

Evidence:"If you have migraines, should you take magnesium supplements? You may have heard or read that high doses of magnesium can help prevent this extremely painful form of chronic headache. While scientists aren’t certain whether magnesium supplements stifle migraines, there’s enough evidence from studies to suggest that this simple, inexpensive treatment might be worth a try.What Is Magnesium?Magnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in your body. Much of it goes toward helping to build bones and muscle, but you also need magnesium to produce energy, control blood pressure, and perform many other critical roles.What’s the Link Between Magnesium and Migraines?Studies have found that people who have migraines tend to have lower levels of magnesium than people who don’t get headaches. Some scientists believe that magnesium blocks signals in the brain that lead to migraines with an aura, or changes in vision and other senses. Research also suggests that magnesium stops certain chemicals that cause pain."

Evidence:"According to the American Diabetes Association, adults with type 2 diabetes should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. Ideally, weekly exercise would be spread over at least three days, with no more than two days passing without some form of activity. For those engaging in high-intensity exercise, shorter durations of 75 minutes per week may be sufficient.RELATED: What Updated Exercise Guidelines Mean for People With DiabetesAnd importantly, weekly workouts should include resistance, or strength, training at least two or three days, preferably on nonconsecutive days. Research shows that performing both aerobic (also known as cardiovascular) exercise and strength training is far more beneficial at improving insulin health than either type of exercise alone, explains Nick Occhipinti, CSCS, an exercise physiologist based in Red Bank, New Jersey.How Exercise Improves Insulin HealthExercise helps manage prediabetes and type 2 diabetes by lowering blood glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity throughout the body. Here’s how:Taking Up Excess Glucose An immediate benefit of exercise is lowering excessively high blood sugar levels, Dr. Kazlauskaite says. Exercise triggers the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the working muscles and organs."

Evidence:"Together with the UK and Ireland, 
Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
"does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects"​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood 
pressure in animals, and to lower blood pressure in people with 
mild hypertension."
Question:Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure? The answer must be yes or no.

yes

Evidence:"But any healthy balanced diet should still be balanced with a regular exercise regimen.Online yoga for knee arthritisEarlier research supports the use of yoga for knee osteoarthritis, showing that it may improve pain, physical function, and joint stiffness. However, none of these prior studies looked specifically at online yoga programs for people with this condition, until now.The new study involved 212 people with knee osteoarthritis. All participants had access to online information about osteoarthritis, treatment options, and the benefits of physical activity, weight loss, and healthy sleep habits.Researchers randomly assigned around half of the people to do a 12-week self-paced online yoga program.The program consisted of a series of 12 pre-recorded 30-minute videos. People were asked to do one video a week, three times during the week.The classes included a slow-paced mix of static and dynamic yoga poses designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles of the core and legs. Instructors also offered different modifications and levels of the poses, so people could adapt the program to suit their personal needs and abilities.However, the classes focused on physical postures but didn’t include other aspects of yoga, such as deep relaxation, chanting, and meditation, which could also help reduce pain.Physical function improved with yogaAfter 12 weeks, subjects who did the yoga classes saw greater improvements on average in their physical function, knee stiffness, and quality of life, compared to those who only had access to online osteoarthritis education.Still, there was only a small difference between the two groups in the level of knee pain while walking at 12 weeks.After the program ended, researchers followed up with participants another 12 weeks later. By then, both groups had similar levels of physical function, pain, knee stiffness, and quality of life.This loss of benefits seen in the yoga group may be because many people stopped doing the yoga classes after the 12-week program ended.During the last week of the course, over two-thirds of participants completed at least two classes a week."

Evidence:"Clinical trials have shown that probiotics can be used as preventive and therapeutic agents in upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and otitis. Their mechanical properties allow them to aggregate and to compete with pathogens for nutrients, space and attachment to host cells. Consequently, they can directly antagonize pathogens and thus exert beneficial effects without directly affecting the metabolism of the host. An overview of the probiotics with such traits, tested up to date in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of URTIs and otitis, is presented in this review. Their mechanical properties in the respiratory tract as well as at other locations are also cited. Species with interesting in vitro properties towards pharyngeal cells or against common respiratory pathogens have also been included."

While he claimed spectacular results, apparently the formula did not work for Mr. Hoxsey who developed cancer of the jaw and decided that conventional radiation was a better option. Harry denied his father’s medical history and claimed to his dying day that the AMA had fabricated a false death certificate and that his father had really died of an infection. In any case, the elder Hoxsey passed the cancer formula to Harry on his deathbed and warned him that “they will persecute you, slander you and try to drive you off the face of the earth.” A savior was born.

Evidence:"Zinc has been in and out of favor as a treatment for the common cold, based on contradictory findings, since the first randomized trial was published in 1984.3A 1998 systematic review (which did not include a quantitative synthesis of data) suggested that zinc was beneficial in reducing the duration and severity of cold symptoms.4 A meta-analysis published in 2000 found that zinc was ineffective compared with placebo in reducing the likelihood that cold symptoms were present after 7 days.5 A meta-analysis published in June 2011 concluded that zinc lozenges reduce the duration of cold symptoms by 12% to 48%, but only at daily doses >75 mg.6These conflicting results have made it difficult to recommend zinc to patients—until now.STUDY SUMMARY: Zinc for colds? Cochrane review provides convincing evidenceThe 2011 Cochrane review that’s the focus of this PURL1 addressed the question: Does zinc reduce the duration and severity of the common cold? The review also assessed zinc’s ability to prevent colds, although only 2 studies focused on prevention. The researchers included only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which oral zinc supplementation was used for ≥5 consecutive days for treatment or ≥5 months for prevention. Studies included patients of any age, taking any dosage and any formulation of zinc.Primary outcomes included the duration of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and the incidence of the common cold in prevention studies. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients symptomatic after 3, 5, and 7 days of treatment, the time to resolution of individual symptoms (eg, cough), change in individual symptom scores, school absences, antibiotic use, and adverse effects.Thirteen therapeutic trials and 2 prevention trials met the inclusion criteria."

Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 
What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018.What did the researchers find?Thirty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e."

Evidence:"Some characteristics of these individuals, such as a tendency toward symbolic processing and imagery, or particular personality traits, may favour engagement in music therapy.For cliniciansMusic therapy, when added to treatment as usual, seems to improve symptoms of depression (moderate‐quality evidence). Music therapy seems to be beneficial also for anxiety (low‐quality evidence), which is often a comorbidity of depression. Severely depressed individuals often experience impairment in maintaining relationships and work engagements. In this regard, evidence suggests significant amelioration in the level of functioning among those who attended music therapy sessions (low‐quality evidence). Improvements in depressive symptoms and functioning are likely interrelated: Mitigation of depressive symptoms may lead to better outcomes in the socio‐occupational sphere, and vice versa. In fact, positive effects might help support motivation as well as emotional and relational competencies of people affected by depression, from adolescents to older adults."

These results are consistent with the findings of recent reports concerning omega-3 fatty acids as an effective adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder (3) and recurrent depression (4). However, the results of the current study extend these findings by suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe cases of borderline personality disorder.The main limitations of this study are that only women were studied and all subjects were moderately ill.

Evidence:"The findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in this group of patients.Trial Registration 
    ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02687815  
                                Introduction
As of 2018, an estimated 5.5 million children in the US had asthma, a major cause of health care utilization and costs.1 In 2018, asthma exacerbations led to more than 546 000 emergency department (ED) visits and 80 000 hospitalizations.1 
Several observational studies have linked low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (henceforth, “vitamin D”) levels to severe asthma exacerbations, lower lung function, and reduced response to corticosteroids.2-5 Such findings may be explained by immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, including regulatory T-cell induction, attenuation of Th2 and Th17 responses, enhancement of IL-10 production, and inhibition of airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and collagen deposition.6-9 Vitamin D may attenuate viral-induced asthma attacks by reducing rhinovirus replication in bronchial epithelium, promoting interferon-mediated antiviral pathways and inducing production of antimicrobial peptides.10,11 
Quiz Ref IDA meta-analysis of clinical trials using participant-level data showed that vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with lower risk of asthma exacerbations, but the pooled estimate was not significant among children younger than 16 years old.12 More recently, a comprehensive review of vitamin D3 for the prevention of wheeze attacks found insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D3 supplementation in children.13 Previous pediatric randomized clinical trials, however, have not focused on children with low vitamin D levels or who are at high risk for severe asthma exacerbations. Moreover, existing trials did not monitor vitamin D levels or did not show consistently improved levels after supplementation. Children with a recent severe asthma exacerbation are at highest risk for subsequent exacerbations, independent of disease severity, treatment, or control.14 The primary hypothesis for this trial was that supplementation with vitamin D3 would improve the time to a severe exacerbation in high-risk children, aged 6 to 16 years, with vitamin D insufficiency and taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma. The secondary hypotheses were that this protective effect would result from reduced incidence of viral-induced exacerbations or enhanced response to corticosteroids. Methods
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at each participating institution, and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute monitored the study. Written parental consent was obtained for participating children, from whom written assent was also obtained."

Evidence:""Feeding with a soy formula should not be recommended for the prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk (for these conditions)," researchers from the Westmead Hospital in New South Wales, Australia, write in the latest issue of The Cochrane Library Newsletter.Breast Is BestFour percent to 6% of children have food allergies, and a close family history is the best predictor of risk. A child that has two parents with food allergies has about a 75% chance of also developing allergies herself. Although the researchers did not review studies that included breastfed babies, pediatric allergy experts contacted by WebMD say the best clinical evidence suggests that breastfeeding is by far the best choice for high-risk babies.The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends "exclusive breastfeeding as the hallmark for food allergy prevention" for at least six months. It further states that breastfeeding should continue for at least a year, although other foods should also be introduced after the sixth month. "The best evidence that we have suggests that breastfeeding can help prevent food allergies in children at high risk," New York allergist Clifford Bassett, MD, tells WebMD. Bassett is a spokesman for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology."

Evidence:"They compared weight loss outcomes in people taking chitosan supplements with those of people taking a placebo (2).Results showed that chitosan supplementation slightly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI) when paired with a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity (2). These results support the findings of a similar, older review, which found that chitosan supplements may be more effective than a placebo as part of a short-term treatment plan for overweight and obesity (2, 8).Both reviews noted improvements in cholesterol levels and blood pressure (2, 8).However, the researchers reported that many studies on chitosan supplements were of poor quality and that there was significant variability among results. The studies that were deemed high quality found chitosan’s impact on body weight to be minimal (2, 8). A small 2014 clinical trial found that supplementing with 3 grams of chitosan per day may be more effective for weight loss when paired with 2 grams of L-ascorbic acid — a type of vitamin C (9).
