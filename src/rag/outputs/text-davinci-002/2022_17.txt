“Crystal healing”,
                simply put, is the healing and balancing of one’s body,
                mind and energy through healing powers of
                crystals. Crystal
                  healing is a superstitious treatment, carried
                out through a number of methods ranging from intricate
                to very simple. Each crystal varies in healing qualities depending on
                the type of crystal and its shape. 1. Turquoise 
              Turquoise is a “protection stone” that is said to increase
              inner calmness, promoting relaxation, in addition to
              aiding in self-expression, problem solving and immune
              function. 2."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Most of the research I found involved patients suffering from either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. What researchers discovered was the undenatured type II collagen, typically derived from chicken cartilage, has an ability to lessen symptoms in both animals and humans afflicted with these conditions. The benefits last only as long as the collagen continues to be consumed, meaning it’s not correcting the underlying root cause of the conditions, but let’s first look at the mechanism at play. I explain the mechanisms underlying autoimmune disease here, but in a nutshell, autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis develop because the immune system mistakes the protein of your joints for an enemy. It attacks this enemy and the result is joint destruction. A healthy immune system would never make such a mistake, but with the autoimmune disease, the immune system is overtaxed and confuses friend for a foe."

"I think that we can make a policy or public health decision that cell phones don't cause cancer based on the summary of the evidence," Rebbeck said. Moreover, messaging on the topic is crucial to help put it all in perspective, he continued. It's important to consider the things that really matter when it comes to cancer risk, such as smoking. There are things people can do  --  cancer screening, prevention, and vaccines  --  that "really make a big difference," he said. "If you're worried about cancer, there are many other things that you can do to reduce your cancer risk that are real.""

Evidence:"What’s more, you inherit genes from both your parents. In some cases, your odds of getting cancer only rise if you inherit a copy of a gene mutation from both of your parents. Although many cancers happen randomly, there’s a lot you can do to lower your risk with a healthy lifestyle.There’s even some evidence that nutrition and lifestyle choices may impact the way certain genes behave. For example, one study from the University of California, San Francisco, found that after 3 months of eating healthfully and exercising regularly, men with early stage prostate cancer had less activity in genes that play a role in whether cancer tumors form, while certain cancer-fighting genes were more active.The bottom line? Genes can tell you some information about your chance of getting cancer. But it’s also important to focus on smart choices every day that boost your overall health."

We don’t know exactly where the theory that cancer is a fungus came from, but it’s a persistent one. The origin of this myth may stem from the idea that cancer is caused by infection from the common fungus candida, and tumours are actually the body’s attempt at protecting itself from this infection.

4 Reasons Squatting Is Great for Knee Health 
										July 9, 2022					
Knee 
Squatting often gets a bad reputation because it can be associated with knee pain. However, if you have a good base of mobility and strength in your core, hips, thighs, feet, and ankles, then squatting can be a powerful exercise to develop leg and core strength and prevent knee problems. For both men and women, maintaining strength in your legs and core is essential for living a healthy and active life. As we age, maintaining good muscle mass and overall strength are necessary to prevent injuries and preserve mobility. Learning or improving your squat technique is one of the most effective movements for improving multiple areas of strength within your body. If you have knee pain, they should be part of your rehabilitation program once your pain subsides and you have developed prerequisite mobility and strength in your legs and core."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"As morphine is taken or abused consistently, these changes become more ingrained. Morphine may become the main way a person is able to feel pleasure; thus, a dependence may form. From Abuse and Dependence to Addiction
Not everyone who develops a dependence on morphine may become addicted to it, but it is highly likely. When someone uses a drug for recreational purposes (i.e., beyond the scope of a legitimate prescription), the risk for becoming addicted to the drug increases. Injecting, snorting, or smoking morphine sends the drug rapidly across the barrier between the brain and blood, and circumvents any extended-release properties, sending the entire dosage into the bloodstream at once. Not only does this raise the risk for a potentially fatal overdose from suppressed respiration rates, it also may lead more quickly to dependence and addiction."
Question:Is morphine addictive?
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Consumption of 100% fruit juice also was not associated with negative impacts on several risk factors for diabetes, including blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.35 Combining 12 randomized controlled trials, a meta-analysis concluded that fruit juice intake had no significant effect on fasting glucose and insulin in adults.3A meta-analysis of four prospective cohort studies concluded that the intake of 100 percent fruit juice was not associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults.4No association was found between consumption of fruit juice and diabetes risk in U.S. women5, French women6, U.S. men7, Finnish men8, Japanese adults9, U.K. adults10, and European adults.11A large study in post-menopausal women (WHI) found no association between 100 percent citrus juice intake and diabetes risk, even at high levels of consumption; also,100 percent fruit juice intake was not related to diabetes risk.12Intake of 100% orange or grapefruit juice was not related to diabetes incidence in African-American women,13 a group at higher risk for type 2 diabetes.14Higher fruit juice intake by women prior to pregnancy was not related to increased risk of gestational diabetes.15Orange juice consumption in children was not associated with fasting glucose, insulin or measures of adiposity and weight.16Higher fruit juice consumption was not associated with increased risk of developing auto-antibodies to insulin or type 1 diabetes in children.17Fruit juice consumption was not associated with fasting glucose or insulin, and/or HOMA-IR in two separate studies in adults.2,18A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that 100% fruit juice has no effect on fasting blood glucose or insulin, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), or hemoglobin A1C.29A meta-analysis found there is no evidence that 100% fruit juice has adverse effects on fasting glucose or insulin and is no different than water on these variables; consumption of 100% juice did not increase the risk of diabetes.30
100% fruit juice was not associated with risk for prediabetes or significant effects on glucose metabolism markers such as fasting glucose and insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and HbA1C in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort.39An analysis of over 54,000 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study reported that the intake of total flavonoids was associated with lower risk for incident diabetes, likely mediated by decreased body fat in those who had the highest intake of flavonoids. A sub-analysis found that 100% orange juice had no adverse impact on the risk for incident diabetes.38
Orange Juice and Blood Glucose Levels
In recent years, studies around 100% orange juice and blood glucose levels have demonstrated a decreased fasting glucose (in men) following consumption,19 or no effect on blood glucose or insulin.20,21,31 A recent study in overweight and obese adults at risk for diabetes showed that 100% orange juice was not different than water on blood glucose or insulin responses when consumed with a meal, even though the orange juice group consumed higher total carbohydrates.32 Even adults drinking high amounts of 100% orange juice (20 to 25 ounces daily) beyond what is recommended for two to three months had no changes in markers of glucose metabolism.22,23 Furthermore, in a cross-over intervention study, consumption of soda resulted in a higher daylong glycemia, higher blood glucose variability, and lower insulin secretion compared to 100% orange juice even though the beverages were matched for sugar content. This study suggests glucose metabolism is different with added-sugar beverages than with 100% orange juice.33 A small acute study in healthy young women reported no difference in glucose or insulin response when comparing consumption of raw oranges with 100% orange juice or 100% orange juice sweetened naturally with nectar (all matched for total sugars), suggesting that orange juice had no differential glucose or insulin response compared to whole fruit.34
Orange Juice Compared to Other Beverages
Additionally, 100% orange juice may have a distinct advantage over sugary beverages. For example, two independent clinical studies comparing 100% orange juice to a glucose drink or water consumed alongside a high-fat/high carbohydrate meal noted more gradual rises in blood glucose and insulin with orange juice when compared to sugary water.24-25
A cohort modeling study found that substituting 100% fruit juice for sugar sweetened beverages resulted in a significant decreased risk for several cardiometabolic markers, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Modeling a substitution of 100% juice for whole fruit did not result in adverse impacts on any cardiometabolic risk factor. These results suggest that although 100% fruit juice and sugar sweetened beverages have similar sugar content, they are not comparable with regard to cardiometabolic risk and that 100% fruit juice and fruit may be comparable regarding their impacts on cardiometabolic risk.36
Orange Juice and Insulin Sensitivity
100% orange juice has also been shown to have no adverse effect on insulin sensitivity in clinical studies with various participants who were at higher risk of diabetes:
Overweight men with elevated cholesterol consuming 250mL (~8oz) of 100% orange juice daily for 12 weeks demonstrated no adverse effects on measures of insulin sensitivity, body composition, or other indices of metabolic syndrome.26Obese adults on a reduced-calorie diet and consuming 500 mL of orange juice daily for three months had HOMA-IR(insulin sensitivity), blood glucose, insulin, and blood lipids either improve or stay within healthy ranges while not hindering weight loss.27Obese children consuming 250 mL of mandarin juice twice a day for four weeks supplementing a hypo caloric diet demonstrated decreased insulin levels and HOMA-IR, which was not observed in the control group.28HOMA-IR was not significantly different in healthy young women immediately following consumption of whole oranges or 100% orange juice (matched for total sugars)."

Evidence:"Developmental psychologists argue that fine motor capabilities like manipulating objects and gesturing sets the stage for acquiring systems required for the subsequent development of language. Left, right or both? Early to mid-20th century scientists considered left-handedness to be a developmental abnormality. It was associated with a range of developmental dysfunctions ranging from language deficits to mental health disorders. In fact, many left-handed children of this era were forced to write with their right hands in an effort to “retrain” them. Today, we understand that handedness is not a binary characteristic (left or right), but rather, it exists along a gradient that ranges from strongly left-handed to strongly right-handed."

Evidence:"Contrary to common belief, marijuana is an addictive substance. Research suggests that approximately nine percent of users develop addiction. The estimated incidence of addiction increases among those who start using at a young age (an estimated 17 percent develop addiction) and among people who use the drug daily (an estimated 25-50 percent become addicted). Individuals who are addicted to cannabis may experience symptoms of withdrawal when attempting to stop using the drug. Long-term users who try to quit report withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety and drug craving--all of which can make it difficult to abstain. Behavioral interventions, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational incentives (e.g., providing vouchers for goods or services to patients who remain abstinent) have proven effective in treatment and rehab for marijuana addiction."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Key et al (7) have provided a pertinent overview of the health effects of vegetarian diets, focusing on their European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Oxford (EPIC-Oxford) study and other large population studies. HEALTH EFFECTS OF VEGAN DIETS
Vegan diets are usually higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamins C and E, iron, and phytochemicals, and they tend to be lower in calories, saturated fat and cholesterol, long-chain n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B-12 (8). In general, vegetarians typically enjoy a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers (3). A vegan diet appears to be useful for increasing the intake of protective nutrients and phytochemicals and for minimizing the intake of dietary factors implicated in several chronic diseases (9). In a recent report (10), different plant food groups were rated with respect to their metabolic-epidemiologic evidence for influencing chronic disease reduction. According to the evidence criteria of the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO/FAO), cancer risk reduction associated with a high intake of fruit and vegetables was assessed as probable or possible, risk of CVD reduction as convincing, whereas lower risk of osteoporosis was assessed as probable (10)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Although hydroquinone has been the dermatological gold standard for skin lightening for over 50 years, in recent times regulatory agencies in Japan, Europe and the United States have questioned its safety [41]. Considering the risks to human health associated with its application, hydroquinone has been banned from cosmetics in Europe since 2001 [40] and its use in skin-lightening cosmetic formulations is currently illegal (see the “Regulations” section for more details). Cosmetics containing hydroquinone have also been banned in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.Several researchers have focused their attention on the mechanisms of depigmentation produced by hydroquinone. It has been shown that hydroquinone inhibits the activity of the tyrosinase enzyme by blocking the oxidation of tyrosine to DOPA and the subsequent oxidation of DOPA, causing the cessation of melanin synthesis; hydroquinone treatment decreases the number of melanised melanosomes and leads to the formation of abnormally melanised melanosomes, which eventually die [42]. Recently, Aspengren et al. [43] demonstrated that tyrosinase is not the only cellular target of hydroquinone, since this compound severely affects certain cytoskeletal structures (microtubules, actin filaments) in cultured melanophores of Xenopus laevis in a dose-dependent manner."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"IntroductionMethanol (CH3OH), also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol, is commonly used as a solvent in different branches of industry [1,2]. Methanol poisoning by ingestion is a global problem, and it is closely related to high morbidity and mortality [3]. Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase subsequently oxidizes formaldehyde to formic acid, which accounts for the associated anion gap metabolic acidosis and end-organ damage [4]. Therefore, methanol ingestion can be fatal. Pure methanol lethal dose is estimated to range from 300 to 1000 mg/kg [5]. Although the recommendations of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology practice guidelines on the treatment of methanol poisoning are already 20 years old [6], they are still valid because mass poisonings with beverages containing methanol occur all over the world [7,8,9]."

Evidence:"However, the study results indicated that even in the first trimester, MRI is not associated with increased incidence of harm to the fetus or during early childhood. On the other hand, the use of gadolinium during MRI at any time during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, and a range of other conditions. Bear in mind, however, that if a serious condition is suspected in either a pregnant woman or her fetus, diagnosis and treatment of that condition can be vital to both maternal and fetal health. As a result, gadolinium contrast may still be recommended in some cases where essential information cannot be obtained in a way that involves less risk. MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis of many conditions. If your doctor has ordered this test while you’re pregnant, make sure to discuss the reason for the test, the potential risks that it can pose to you and/or your developing child, and the potential benefit it can provide."

The statement highlights research showing physically active people have a 21% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a 36% lower risk of death from cardiovascular diseases compared to inactive people. Federal physical activity guidelines suggest people participate in either a cumulative 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly, plus two or more strength training sessions each week. However, there is no minimum to receive benefits. "Every little bit of activity is better than none," Gibbs said.

Evidence:"But does vitamin C — and the supplements that tout its benefits — really work to prevent (or cure) the common cold?Share on PinterestMarc Tran/StocksyMythbusting: The science on vitamin C and coldsResearchers have studied the role that vitamin C, aka ascorbic acid, plays in preventing and treating the common cold for more than 70 years. And spoiler: We still don’t quite know all the facts.A 2013 research review concluded that supplementing your diet with 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C has no impact on the risk of getting a cold. But it does have the potential to shorten the duration of an existing cold and reduce its severity.Research showed that taking 1 to 8 grams of extra vitamin C per day may lighten your sniffles. A 2006 research review showed that when your body is fighting an infection, the immune cells that store vitamin C get depleted. So, taking more vitamin C when you’re sick may improve those cells. One study found that consuming high doses of vitamin C (approximately 8 grams daily) benefited cold treatment if administered within 24 hours of having cold symptoms and continued for 5 days."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"At this point there is insufficient data to conclude whether those meats are safer than the “non-organic” meats. The media has reported that 50g/day consumption of processed meat can risk for colorectal cancer from an average 5 percent lifetime risk to 6 percent. This does not sound like much of an increase in risk. 50g processed meat is equivalent to about 6 slices of bacon or one hot dog. The 5 percent to 6 percent increase in risk of colorectal cancer reported in the media is a population average, but this estimate does not take into account that for certain subgroups (e.g., those who are also obese, are physically inactive or consume diets high in sugar, saturated fat etc., or are more genetically susceptible) the absolute risk can be higher. As mentioned above, high consumption of red and processed meat is associated with higher risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, not just colorectal cancers and high processed meat consumption is estimated to account for about 644,000 deaths worldwide."
