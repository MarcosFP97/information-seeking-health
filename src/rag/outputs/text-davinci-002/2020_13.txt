Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"While there is also evidence that vitamin D and melatonin may have positive effects on immune function, a specific antiviral effect remains unproven. What’s the evidence that supplements are helpful for COVID-19? Though COVID-19 is a new illness, a few clinical trials have explored the possibility that supplements may be effective. And, unfortunately, most of the evidence is unconvincing. For example, a few observational studies link lower blood vitamin levels with a higher risk of testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 (see this study and this one). But studies like these cannot prove that vitamin D protects people against infection."
Question:Can vitamin D cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Studies suggest that high-dose vitamin C treatment reduces mortality in patients with sepsis and ARDS, and may also be beneficial in COVİD-19 disease. In the study; the investigator aimed to determine the effect of Vitamin C on short-term mortality and length of intensive care stay in COVID-19 patients. Condition or disease  
Intervention/treatment  
Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult
Covid19
Drug: Ascorbic acid
Detailed Description:
SARS-CoV-2 causes tissue damage in the endothelium and epithelium, increased vascular permeability and increased plasma levels of IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10 causing interstitial fibrosis in the lung is considered. Considering these factors in pathogenesis, a picture with high mortality from acute respiratory failure to severe ARDS emerges in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, despite numerous studies, an effective antiviral treatment has not yet been found in COVID-19 disease. The low level of evidence for the recommendations presented in the guidelines on both treatment and mechanical ventilation has brought supportive treatments to the agenda."

Evidence:"Researchers performed a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04417335) in 2014 adults aged 60 years and older to determine if the BCG vaccine could prevent COVID-19 infection or provide heterologous protection against nontuberculosis infections. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive either intracutaneous vaccination with BCG (n=1008) or placebo (n=1006). The cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infections requiring medical intervention during 12 months of follow-up was the primary endpoint. The incidence of COVID-19 and the vaccine effects on cellular and humoral immune responses were secondary endpoints. The median patient age was 67 (IQR, 64-72) years, 47.5% were women, none of the patients had a medical history of SARS-CoV-2, and 29.2% of patients who received the BCG vaccine vs 25.4% who did not receive the BCG vaccine had a history of BCG vaccination before the study. The cumulative incidence of infections satisfying the primary endpoint definition was 0.029 and 0.024 for the BCG-vaccinated and placebo groups, respectively (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.26; 98.2% CI, 0.65-2.44)."

Evidence:"conducted a nationwide register-based study of patients in Denmark with COVID-19 to assess if prescription of ibuprofen affected the risk of severe disease48. The outcome assessed was a 30-day composite of severe COVID-19 diagnosis with acute respiratory syndrome, ICU admission, or death. The study found that there was no significant (p = 0.74) association between ibuprofen prescription claims and severe COVID-19; standardized absolute risks of the composite outcome for ibuprofen-prescribed vs. non-ibuprofen patients were 16.3% (95% CI 12.1–20.6) vs. 17.0% (95% CI 16.0–18.1). Similarly, in the Saudi Arabian study of COVID-19 patients reported by Abu Esba et al., acute use of ibuprofen was not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-NSAID users38.Castro et al. used electronic health records to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with a lower risk of morbidity among patients with COVID-1949. Records of 12,818 individuals from five US hospitals were assessed."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The just-announced study aims to prove that. Other European researchers, reporting in Rhinology Online, speculate that copper-enhanced nasal saline irrigations confer protection against COVID-19. Based upon a study that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in which copper eliminated all viable SARS-CoV-2 virus on its surface within four hours, the authors suggest that copper-infused sale solution may “decrease the potential risk of viral infection by both a mechanical and biological effect.” No studies assessing the effects of copper on COVID-19 have been listed yet on ClinicalTrials.gov. Salt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat."
Question:Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that while natural remedies such as ginger can have a "positive impact on your health," they are by no means a medically proven treatment for fighting COVID-19.Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, made the comments after posts continued to be widely shared on social media touting ginger and other natural remedies as cures for the novel coronavirus. The WHO said ginger is not a medically proven treatment for fighting COVID-19. /VCG

"I think we have to be careful with what we would consider to be the traditional remedies that people use for making themselves feel better," said Ryan during a press briefing from Geneva on Wednesday.He added: "During a common cold or the flu or any illness… some of us like to take a drink with honey, some like to take ginger, some of us take special herbal teas. "Anything that makes one feel better, anything that provides that reassurance and anything that you believe can help your health that's not dangerous certainly has a positive impact on your health, but it's a different thing to say that something is effective in treating the disease," he added. Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant."

Evidence:"We found the following main narratives: 
1. The Immunosuppressor narrative suggests that radiation from 5G antennas weakens the immune system, thereby making people highly susceptible to an otherwise harmless virus. 2. The Cover-up narrative states that radiation of 5G equipment is lethal, and that deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic are actually caused by 5G. The pandemic is alleged to have been invented to hide this. 3."

Evidence:"Aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae perilla and sage elicit potent and sustained antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. The herbal infusions exerted antiviral effects comparable to interferon-β and remdesivir but outperformed convalescent sera and interferon-α2 upon short-term treatment early after infection. Based on protein fractionation analyses, we identified caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde, and perillyl alcohol as antiviral compounds. Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses performed comparatively in two different cell culture infection models revealed changes of the proteome upon treatment with herbal infusions and provided insights into the mode of action. As inferred by the MS data, induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was confirmed as effector mechanism by the antiviral activity of the HMOX-1-inducing compounds sulforaphane and fraxetin. In conclusion, herbal teas based on perilla and sage exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.Competing Interest StatementDeclaration of interest

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"What is the current status of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 disease? Particularly before monoclonal antibodies were available, multiple studies focused on the use of CCP to deliver antibodies to patients with COVID-19 without unexpected or serious adverse events. Many of the early studies were observational and nonrandomized in patients with severe or critical disease, complicated by the evolution of additional treatment interventions over time, such as steroids, antivirals, and other drugs; by patient heterogeneity; and by a lack of detailed analyses of neutralizing antibody content of infused units. More than 90,000 patients were enrolled in an FDA-sponsored expanded access program coordinated by Mayo Clinic. In addition, an EUA was issued by the FDA allowing CCP administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside clinical trials. While many patients improved clinically, the specific role of CCP was unclear, given treatment with other therapies including antivirals and/or corticosteroids."

Evidence:"While typically harmless, this bacterium is well known for causing pneumonia and other diseases, often in interaction with viruses. This new Kaiser Permanente study provides evidence that these bacterial-viral interactions may play out in ways that shape the course of COVID-19. While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing COVID-19, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine. In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection. This study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1 to July 22, 2020. Among that population, 3,677 had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 1,075 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 334 died from COVID-19."

Estrogen is known to improve the way cells that fight infections work and can increase thenumber of these cellsThe risk of death from COVID-19 for women >50 years taking HRT has been shown toreduce by more than 50%4Low estrogen and low testosterone in women are likely to be associated with Long CovidAnecdotally many women with Long Covid have improved with estrogen and testosteronereplacementThe majority of women have more benefits than risks from taking HRT
Relevance of estrogen to COVID-19 infectionsThere are marked differences in morbidity and mortality from COVD-19 between the sexes, with men at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death than women.An early study from Wuhan has shown that women with low estrogen levels had more severe infection with COVID-192.An analysis of electronic health records of nearly 70,000 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from 17 countries has shown that women taking HRT were more than 50% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to women not taking HRT(4).Estrogen and immunity It is well established that there are differences between female and male sexes in responses to infections, with females having better immune response (ability to fight infections) than males.There is evidence that estrogen can work as an anti-viral for other infections including hepatitis C, Ebola and HIV infections.There are numerous ways that estrogen can influence the response to COVID-19 infection especially with the way it improves women’s immune function as well as working in a protective way on the blood vessels and cardiovascular system.There are estrogen receptors on all cells that fight infections. Estrogen works to improve the number, genetic programming and lifespan of all immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells(5).Estrogen also regulates the production of numerous cytokines (chemicals that are produced by these immune cells) including interleukin-6, interferon and tumour necrosis factor. Estrogen can block the production of interleukin-6 which is important in the cytokine storm which occurs in some people with severe COVID-19 infections. A cytokine storm is when large quantities of cytokines are produced in the body which have a detrimental effect. This is because these cytokines then lead to organ and tissue damage (especially in the lungs)(6).More specifically to COVID-19 infections, estrogen can inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which then has a protective effects on the heart, lung, kidneys, central nervous system and gut(7). Hormones, menopause and HRTThe menopause is a long-term hormone deficiency leading to health risks if not appropriately managed with hormone replacement therapy (HRT)."

Evidence:"The finding is a part of a project aimed at identifying existing medications that can be used to treat COVID-19 and its symptoms.However, there are many types of cough medications, the broad categories being suppressants, the type studied above, and expectorants. This research specifically looked at medications with dextromethorphan, which acts as a suppressant.The study didn't find that that the drug would make COVID-19 worse, increase your chances of developing COVID-19, or otherwise harm you in any way. It's just currently a finding from research that was conducted in monkeys, and it's important to note that animal findings often don't hold true in humans. Still, the authors suggest being cautious about dextromethorphan. "By the same standard, we find that the widely used antitussive dextromethorphan harbors proviral activity and therefore its use should merit caution and further study in the context of COVID-19," they write.Dextromethorphan is understood to work by decreasing activity in the part of your brain that causes coughs.For cough relief without relying on that ingredient, use an expectorant that contains guaifenesin, which thins mucus to make coughing easier. People with COVID-19 typically experience a dry cough, meaning you aren't spitting up mucus."

Evidence:""We also encourage you to wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses," said Walensky, adding that people living in areas with high levels of Covid transmission should especially consider masking.The CDC director said the agency is considering expanding its system of Covid community levels to take into account other respiratory viruses such as the flu. The system is the basis for when CDC advises the public to wear masks. But Walensky encouraged people to take proactive action. "One need not wait on CDC action in order to put a mask on," Walensky said. "We would encourage all of those preventive measures — hand washing, staying home when you're sick, masking, increased ventilation — during respiratory virus season, but especially in areas of high Covid-19 community levels.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Scientists from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have released a report busting myths around alcohol and Covid-19. They explored how drinking alcohol and how it could actually increase your chances of suffering from acute, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - one of the most severe complications of the virus. For more coronavirus news and stories, click here. The study states alcohol has a 'deleterious effect' on your immune system and will not stimulate immunity and virus resistance. In fact, drinking could make your immune system worse at fighting the virus, the WHO says. (Stock image) People having a drink outside a restaurant

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In addition, research shows coronavirus has the potential to live longer on surfaces in colder environments. “When you combine lower relative humidity with colder temperatures,” Dr. Rosenberg says, “one is potentially at even more increased risk for developing infection. This is supported by data collected with respect to COVID-19 outbreaks in both Seattle and China.” 
What Can We Do About It? Using home humidifiers during winter can be useful in keeping relative humidity levels in the recommended 40 to 60 percent range to potentially reduce the risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 and other viral infections. However, controlled clinical trials investigating the extent of this benefit are still needed. Dr. Rosenberg also cautions, “While home humidifiers may be useful in reducing risk of viral infection, improper use of humidifiers is associated with certain health issues."

      About remdesivir
Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading in the body.It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.You will usually be given remdesivir through a drip in your arm (infusion).You'll need to have the treatment as soon as possible after you have tested positive for COVID-19 and within 7 days of your symptoms starting.You'll be given remdesivir in a hospital or at a local centre.You will only be eligible to have the medicine if you are in the highest risk group.If you are in the highest risk group you may be sent a letter and a lateral flow test that you can do at home should you develop symptoms of COVID-19. You must report your COVID-19 lateral flow test result on GOV.UK.If you test positive for COVID-19, are eligible and have reported the result, you will be contacted by the NHS. This will usually be by text, email or phone.If you have not been contacted within 24 hours of your positive test, but think you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call your GP surgery, specialist or 111. They can make an urgent referral if needed.You will then be assessed (over the phone) to see if remdesivir is right for you. If it's suitable, they'll tell you where to get your treatment, how to get there and how to return home safely. This will usually be by text, email or phone."

Evidence:"Therefore, some participants may have been wrongly classified as “controls” in the study, when, in reality, they may have had COVID-19. This could affect the accuracy of the results.In addition, the relatively small sample size meant that there were wide margins of error in the estimates of how much of an impact diet had on people’s risk of getting seriously ill. For instance, for people following a plant-based diet, the odds of becoming seriously ill were anywhere between 19 and 90% lower.The authors also found that when they adjusted for access to personal protective equipment (PPE), the results for the plant-based diet seemed to hold, but the plant- or fish-based diet stopped being statistically significant. Therefore, it is possible for the relationship between diet and severity of illness to be explained by other factors, such as PPE, that the researchers did not adjust for.Finally, the majority of the people in this study were white male Western doctors. Therefore, we do not yet know how generalizable these results are to the rest of the population.As McAuliffe concluded:“This study highlights the need for better designed prospective studies on the association between diet, nutritional status, and COVID-19 outcomes.”For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Nutrition / DietCOVID-19Share this articleBy Robby Berman on June 9, 2021 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, MPHLatest newsPoor sleep during teen years may raise risk of multiple sclerosis (MS)3 servings of grapes a day may reduce the chances of sunburn for some peoplePancreatic cancer: 4-drug chemo regimen shows promise in improving survival ratesSoybean protein may help lower cholesterol, be as beneficial as statinsCould changes in speech patterns help diagnose depression early?Related CoverageWhat to know about COVID-19 and a plant-based dietMedically reviewed by Kathy Warwick, RD, LDA plant-based or vegan diet cannot prevent people from developing COVID-19.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"When more people get vaccinated against the flu, less flu can spread through the community. It is especially important to get the flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic:
Flu vaccination reduces the prevalence and severity of illness caused by flu, reducing symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19
It will reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness that will protect people at higher risk for severe illness of both flu and COVID-19
The reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions from flu vaccination will alleviate stress on the health care system
For additional information, please see the CDC page: This Season a Flu Vaccine is More Important than Ever! Yes, a flu vaccine offers the best defense against getting the flu and spreading it to others. Children younger than 5 years of age — especially those younger than 2 years old — are at high risk of serious flu-related symptoms and complications. Flu vaccination has been found to reduce deaths in children."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum and patches are designed to help smokers quit tobacco. WHO recommends that smokers take immediate steps to quit by using proven methods such as toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging programmes, and nicotine replacement therapies. Within 20 minutes of quitting, elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The researchers wrote that their findings demonstrate that blood Type O "is significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to" the novel coronavirus—though they also noted that their study had several limitations and called for further research on the topic. For the second study, researchers in Canada analyzed data on 95 patients in Vancouver who tested positive for the coronavirus between February and April. All of the patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 in an ICU. Among those patients, the researchers found that those with Type A or AB blood had a median ICU stay of 13.5 days, compared to with a median ICU stay of nine days among patients with blood Type O or B. The researchers also found that the patients with Type A or AB blood were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, at 84%, than patients with blood Type O or B, at 61%. The researchers wrote that, overall, their findings "demonstrate that critically ill Covid-19 patients with blood [Type] A or AB are associated with an increased risk for requiring mechanical ventilation … and prolonged ICU length of stay compared with patients with blood [Type] O or B.""

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Washing your hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds is most effective. This is because soap actively destroys the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 and really reduces how much of the virus is left on your skin. Alcohol-based hand rubs can be used to disinfect your hands when soap and water are not available. Stop the spread of COVID-19 and other germs Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Using soap and water is the single most effective way of reducing the spread of infection because soap actively destroys the surface of the virus.If soap and water are not available, alcohol-based hand rubs can be used to clean your hands as long as they are not visibly soiled. If they are visibly soiled, use a wipe and then alcohol-based hand rubs to effectively clean them.Note that Health Canada has recently recalled some hand sanitizer products; check your products against the 
                                 recall list."

The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that no country is immune to the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases. Ensuring prompt, affordable, and equitable global access to potentially life-saving therapies, including biologic products such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is therefore imperative. Monoclonal antibodies can be effective at decreasing hospitalization rates and progression to severe disease and death for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. In addition, mAbs have been shown to improve survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have not mounted their own immune response. They may also have a role in preventing infections, particularly in unvaccinated close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The pandemic has sparked innovation and has demonstrated that mAbs for a new virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be developed, tested, and authorized for use in just months."

Hib (also called Haemophilus influenzae type b) is a serious disease in young children. It can affect the airways, skin, ears or brain. Vaccination is a safe and effective way to protect you from Hib
Who should get vaccinated against Hib
Anyone who wants to protect themselves against Hib can talk to their vaccination provider about getting vaccinated. The Australian Immunisation Handbook recommends Hib vaccination for specific groups including:
routine vaccination in infants and children
infants and children under 5 years of age who have missed a dose of Hib-containing vaccine
people who are immunocompromised, including people with asplenia and people who have received a haematopoietic stem cell transplant."

Evidence:"In the budesonide group, only one person needed urgent medical care, compared to 10 people in the group who received the standard care for COVID-19. Another University of Oxford study that has yet to be peer reviewed also found that inhaled budesonide helped people who were at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes recover quicker. "There's good biological plausibility" for why corticosteroids would work, Chloe Bloom, a senior clinical research fellow at Imperial College London's National Heart and Lung Institute, told DW. Bloom was not involved in the study. Corticosteroids like dexamethasone are already being used effectively in hospitalized, severely ill COVID-19 patients. Bloom said researchers think it likely reduces the inflammation associated with severe COVID-19."

						Vitamin D, Multivits, Probiotics and Omega-3 Reduce COVID in Women, Not Men
									Becky McCall

									 20 April 2021
								 Probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements are associated with reduced risk of coronavirus infection in women but not men, while vitamin C, garlic and zinc show no clear benefit in either, according to the latest findings from users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app. The study is the largest observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and dietary supplement use to date, drawing on data from more than 400,000 app users from the UK, US, and Sweden. Similar results were found across all three countries and are published today in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention and Health. Cristina Menni, PhD, specialises in gut microbiome and metabolomics at the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, and led the study. "We had a very big sample size looking at the correlation between the supplements and COVID-19, and found that vitamin D, probiotics, multivitamins, and omega-3 show a modest reduction in the chances of catching COVID-19," she told Medscape News UK in an interview. "We can’t make a recommendation based on this alone, but it does however lay the foundations for a larger randomised controlled trial.""

Evidence:"The corollary of this observation is that humans are very likely to carry Ig antibodies against these viruses. There is a lack of effective therapies against this virus. The current study, published in Virology Journal, examines the utility of IVIg in COVID-19. Such therapy has already come into clinical use against a host of inflammatory diseases, including allergies, autoimmune and neurological diseases, and atopy, but also in the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). There is an urgent need to develop effective methods to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 in about 14% of patients who would otherwise develop severe or critical disease. An earlier study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIg in this condition, attributed to its ability to remove complement, block immune cell receptors and directly inhibit the virus."

The authors conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) on the effects of ginger and echinacea in hospitalization rates and symptoms of patients suspected of having COVID-19. The RCT was conducted with outpatients in an urban health center (Saveh University of Medical Sciences; Saveh, Markazi, Iran [IR]) in April–June 2020. Suspicion was based on positive chest X-ray/CT scan and presenting symptoms consistent with COVID-19."
