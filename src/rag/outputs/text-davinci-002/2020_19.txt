Evidence:"There is currently no evidence to demonstrate that vitamin D supplements can protect people with COVID-19 from more serious health complications. Clinical trials are underway to examine the topic further. What happens if vitamin D levels in the body are too low? It is well established that low levels of vitamin D can contribute to bones becoming more fragile and prone to breaking due to loss of bone mineral density. In mild cases, this is known as osteopenia. In more severe cases, this is known as osteoporosis, which occurs when your bones lose calcium and other minerals at a rate that’s too fast for your body to replace."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In a review titled “The Role of Diet and Supplements in the Prevention and Progression of COVID-19: Current Knowledge and Open Issues”​ published in the journal Preventive Nutrition and Food Science, researchers said the most robust results from human studies involve vitamin C, which could decrease inflammatory markers and suppress cytokine storm.Meanwhile, for vitamin D, there is evidence that it could significantly reduce the need for intensive care if hospitalised for COVID-19.“Natural compounds have been shown to exert antiviral, antifibrotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, which might synergise as prophylactic or supportive agents to reduce some typical COVID-19 symptoms.​“Furthermore, a healthy nutritional status has been reported to support immune function and prevent the onset of severe infection. This suggests the potential role of a healthy diet together with dietary supplements as co-adjuvants in treating COVID-19 and possibly even in the prevention of severe forms of the disease,” ​said the researchers.Therefore, the team aimed to critically review the current evidence on the impact of diet and different dietary components on the prevention and progression of COVID-19. The analysis was categorised according to nutrients, like vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, and probiotics.Different nutrients, different impact​Vitamin C supplementation has been known to improve the immune system, reduce the risk, severity and duration of different infectious diseases, and exert antiviral effects on illnesses like the common cold and pneumonia. These effects were demonstrated through studies done by Marik et al​. (2017), Kim et al.​ (2018) and Ran et al.​ (2018). However, the actual clinical relevance and optimal efficacy of its dosage in preventing and treating infections remain unknown.Alamdari et al.​’s work in 2020 showed that oral or intravenous administration of vitamin C with other substances improved survival rates, whereas Hiedra et al.​’s (2020) study showed the nutrient was linked to decreased inflammatory markers.Despite various promising clinical studies, further clinical trials are needed to fully delineate the effects of vitamin C on COVID-19 infection and recommend its supplementation.The possible association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 has also been investigated in several studies.According to a meta-analysis by Pal et al.​ (2022), vitamin D supplementation might be associated with improved clinical outcomes, especially when administered after the diagnosis of COVID-19."

Evidence:"In a similar way the European Medicine Agency (EMA) released the following statement: “There is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID-19. EMA is monitoring the situation closely and will review any new information that becomes available on this issue in the context of the pandemic” [91]. Differently, the World Health Organization (WHO), after advising not to use ibuprofen for COVID-19, quickly retracted the public advisory on March 18, 2020 [92]. While the scientific debate whether to use or not ibuprofen in the course of COVID-19 continues [93,94,95,96], the first data have been published. Abu Esba and colleagues prospectively recruited 503 adults with a confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection of whom 40 (8%) using ibuprofen during the infection, 17 (3.4%) assuming other NSAIDs and 96 (19%) being chronically treated with NSAIDs before and during the infection. Neither the acute nor the chronic use of NSAIDs resulted to be associated with increased mortality or severe COVID19 [97]."

Evidence:"This program provided a pathway for patients with serious or life-threatening COVID-19 access to investigational convalescent plasma outside of clinical trials because no satisfactory alternative therapy options were available. After evaluating safety and efficacy data for patients transfused in the Mayo Clinic-led EAP program and other existing data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to further expand access to convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. This EUA allows the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to be distributed and used by licensed health care providers to treat adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Evidence:"Initial results for the BCG vaccine in playing a cross protective role look promising and a further understanding of the underlying mechanisms could support the use of BCG as a broad-spectrum protector. Are influenza and pneumococcal vaccines more than one-hit wonders? The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines have also shown potential protective effects against COVID-19. For example:
One study has shown that if a population had a 10% increase in influenza vaccination, there was a 28% reduction in COVID-19 death rate in elderly people
When looking at the CAS Content Collection, more than 50 percent of the documents exploring a connection between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine suggested vaccination had a positive effect (Figure 1)
Research exposing human immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 found an improved cytokine response if the immune cells came from a vaccinated individual. A possible mechanism is that the vaccine acts as a non-specific immune stimulator which works as a kind of early warning system leading to activation of the immune system in general, meaning it is ready when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. However, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines would benefit from further real-world studies to uncover associations with COVID-19 cross protection."

Evidence:"(Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images) This article is more than 2 years old.Researchers are now finding more evidence that gender could play a role in who gets sick from the coronavirus. Globally, women who contract COVID-19 have been less likely than men to get really sick or die.This week, researchers in Los Angeles have begun giving male coronavirus patients the hormone progesterone, mainly found in women, to see if that helps them recover.One of the researchers, Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says she began noticing more men than women in the intensive care unit as a result of COVID-19.“The difference is pretty striking,” she says. “There are definitely more men on the ventilators.”Ghandehari believes progesterone might be beneficial because of the hormone’s anti-inflammatory properties, which reduce the inflammatory response of immune cells thus decreasing the “abnormalities” that male coronavirus patients are experiencing.The study is in its infancy stages: 40 men who have tested positive for the coronavirus receive two shots of progesterone for five days.To “really know the results,” Ghandehari says they’ll need to test and evaluate more patients. The research is designed in a randomized format where half receive the hormone treatment and half receive standard care.“The difference is pretty striking. There are definitely more men on the ventilators.” Dr. Sara Ghandehari“The folks that have received the progesterone, they have tolerated [the hormone] really well without any side effects,” she says. “And as far as results go, hopefully soon we'll have more information.”If administered in short-term doses, the potential dangers of giving men a female sex hormone are “very, very low,” she says."

Evidence:"“The major reason older people with pneumonia die is that they decline and become too weak to even cough and clear their lungs.”All of us have sensory nerves in the epithelium, the thin layer of tissue that forms the outer lining of body parts ranging from the eardrums, heart, and stomach to the larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and bronchi, explains Checkley.Normally, when sensory nerves detect a virus or other foreign invader, they activate cough sensors in the medulla region of the brain, which in turn trigger the muscles around the respiratory tract to eject the unwanted visitor.“But it’s also possible that the COVID-19 virus may directly or indirectly target the sensory nerves themselves, as a part of the infection,” says Checkley, adding that this theory needs further study.How to Prevent Coughs From Spreading the CoronavirusAs most of us know by now, it’s crucial to cover a COVID-19 cough with a face mask, a tissue, or a bent elbow to reduce the spread of infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols.A January 2022 report in the physics journal AIP Advances that studied how droplets are dispersed via coughing also recommends lowering your head to reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others.If your cough hangs on even after you’re past the worse of the acute infection, could you still be spreading COVID-19? “The risk of transmissibility drops significantly after 10 days,” says Checkley. “But while you don’t have to stay isolated at home if you’re coughing, it’s prudent — and polite — to continue wearing a mask and to social distance.”How to Calm That Cough DownFortunately, there are things you can do to treat a cough while you recover from COVID-19 at home. So can cough suppressants with codeine. They make you sleepy, so are good to use at night, but you don’t want to become reliant on that.”For Searight, who is off prescription cough medicine, drinking lots of herbal tea and taking lozenges help, she says.Be sure to let your physician know if you have a cough that won’t quit or another stubborn COVID-19 issue."

NEW DELHI: Dozens of Hindu activists held a cow urine party in the Indian capital Saturday to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, as countries around the world struggle to control the deadly pandemic. Members and supporters of All India Hindu Mahasabha staged fire rituals and drank from earthen cups to fight COVID-19 at the gathering in New Delhi dubbed a “gaumutra (cow urine) party.”
Many in the Hindu-majority nation of 1.3 billion consider cows sacred and in recent years have made several assertions about the liquid being an elixir, claims that critics have rejected as quackery. “Whoever drinks cow urine will be cured and protected,” Hari Shankar Kumar, one of the volunteers at the event, told AFP as he served the “remedy” in brown clay cups. Governments and scientists have said no medicine or vaccine is available to protect or cure people of the infection that has killed more than 5,400 people and infected nearly 150,000 across six continents."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Moreover, the fact that the L/R has been shown to inhibit this coronavirus enzyme with enhanced affinity [10] pinpoints at a possible role for its use in the treatment of COVID-19.On the other hand, chloroquine has been shown to deter the in vitro virus-host cell fusion by interfering with the glycosylation of the ACE2 protein [11–13]. Moreover, after penetration, the virus releases its genome and some enzymes into the cytoplasm by fusing with the lysosomal membrane, in a process aided by the acidic pH of the aforementioned cell structure. In concordance, chloroquine has been shown to inhibit this process in other enveloped virus-dependent infections, like Chikungunya and Dengue, by the means of lysosome alkalization [14]. Additionally, this drug also reduces the levels of IL-6 in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [15], thus hypothetically reducing the chance to develop cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome- (ARDS-) related complications [16].Nonetheless, while small clinical trials have shown a strong effect for lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R) in reducing the viral load, along with body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase [17] while increasing the level of oxygen saturation and pressure, platelet, lymphocyte, leukocyte, and eosinophil counts; while reducing the extension of radiological findings [4], other studies with enhanced power have shown no reduction in viral load in relation to the L/R drug combination [18]. Additionally, other study shows that while a combination of interferon β-1b, L/R, and ribavirin is effective at alleviating symptoms, shortening the duration of viral shedding, and reducing hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, L/R alone lacks a strong regulatory ability over such disease [19].On the other hand, the role for Chlo in COVID-19 treatment has been more controversial, as low power studies suggest that this agent is able to shorten the viral shedding stage to only 6-8 days, especially in combination with azithromycin [20], while bigger studies showed that the viral clearance rate occurred for most patients at day 10 posttreatment onset (PTO) [21] or that there were no differences in mortality or intubation risk in relation to this treatment [22]. Interestingly, none of these studies were carried out in severely ill patients, and the only study to date that was performed with this kind of patients [23] found no difference in the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21, overall survival, acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence, or changes in respiratory support requirements between the hydroxychloroquine and the standard care group."

Evidence:"Actual destruction rates depend on the intensity of the light and the length of time of exposure. Unfortunately, UV-C light is not safe for human exposure because it can damage skin and eyes. It also can damage building materials, causing them to become brittle, and it can change their color. But with proper placement, shielding and safety precautions, the application of UV-C light can be an effective tool against COVID-19. Three primary types of UV-C lamps are in use today: low- and medium-pressure mercury lamps; pulsed xenon arc lamps; and lamps that use LED technology.

“The actions taken today to increase access to Tamiflu show our preparedness system at work,” said Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell. “The country is more prepared for this surge because the SNS holds strategic stores of Tamiflu. As a result, jurisdictions will be able to get the support they need to keep Americans healthy as flu cases rise this winter.”
HHS has partnered closely with jurisdictions for months to address any strain to health care systems created by the confluence of COVID-19, flu, and RSV – including a specific focus on expanding access to medicines under high demand. Manufacturers continue to report that they are running manufacturing facilities 24-7 to address high demand and have encouraged the public to only buy what they need. On December 2, Secretary Becerra sent a letter to states highlighting resources and flexibilities available this winter including Centers for Disease Control funding, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waivers, telehealth flexibilities, and ASPR surge resources.

Evidence:"Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Alcohol has been flying off the shelves as people try to combat boredom during lockdown, with some reports estimating that alcoholic beverage sales surged by 55 percent toward the end of March. The spike in alcohol sales has alarmed health experts and officials around the world, who are concerned that increased drinking could make people even more vulnerable to the respiratory disease.The U.S. surgeon general warned at-risk adults to refrain from drinking. Soon after, the World Health Organization (WHO) also suggested that people cut back on drinking, since alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19. “Alcohol consumption is associated with a range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and mental health disorders, which can make a person more vulnerable to COVID-19. In particular, alcohol compromises the body’s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes,” the WHO stated.Though there’s still limited data on the link between alcohol and COVID-19, past evidence shows alcohol consumption can worsen the outcomes from other respiratory illnesses by damaging the lungs and gut, and impairing the cells responsible for immune function."

For Immediate Release:
January 21, 2022
Español
Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took two actions to expand the use of the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) to certain non-hospitalized adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. This provides another treatment option to reduce the risk of hospitalization in high-risk patients. Previously, the use of Veklury was limited to patients requiring hospitalization. “On the heels of the FDA’s recent authorization of two oral antiviral drugs, today’s actions bolster the arsenal of therapeutics to treat COVID-19 and respond to the surge of the omicron variant,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s actions provide adults and pediatric patients, with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19, with a treatment option they could receive outside of a traditional inpatient hospital setting, including at skilled nursing facilities, home healthcare settings and outpatient facilities such as infusion centers.” 
Veklury is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended."

Evidence:"“It’s particularly tough because both heart disease and COVID-19 have the same risk factors for having a bad outcome — it’s a perfect storm,” Williams says. Here is a list of risk factors that contribute to worse outcomes for heart disease and the virus:
Diabetes
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Obesity
Williams emphasizes that nutrition can help manage and improve, if not reverse, all of these risk factors. If you want to avoid a bad outcome from cardiovascular causes, or even COVID-19, this is the time to change your diet. Importance of healthy eating
Williams’ research shows that a whole-food, plant-based diet is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and, ultimately would contribute to a lower risk of COVID-19. “Your level of heart inflammation goes down when you eat a whole-food, plant-based diet, and it helps to build your immune system,” he says. “So, as I like to say it, #GoVegan4COVID.”There are over 20,000 types of vegetables, fruits, grains and beans on this planet, but Williams notes that if you’re still not sure what to eat, focus your grocery shopping on the produce section."

Evidence:"It is not for pregnant women, children receiving aspirin or asthmatics under age 4. Can you get COVID-19 and flu shots at the same time?Yes. The CDC originally recommended a two-week spacing between COVID-19 and other vaccinations, since it was closely monitoring reactions for this new vaccine. Now you can get your COVID-19 shot or booster and flu vaccination at the same time. Studies show having them together does not affect efficacy. Who is especially vulnerable for contracting the flu?Everyone 6 months of age or older should be vaccinated, but it is especially important for those who are at higher risk for complications and mortality."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Similarly, no data were reported with respect to the use of ACEIs and ARBs for the infection. Guo et al (2020), in evaluating cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 infection, the use of ACEIs/ARBs did not show any association with mortality.37,45 But previous animal studies showed that ACEIs and ARB increase ACE2 activity. Based on prior animal studies, it was suggested that proposed ACEIs and ARBs can enhance ACE2 activity and thereby increase infectivity of COVID-19 virus. Other studies in mice and humans showed in contrary to the above animal studies. ACE2 mRNA expression in rat heart cells treated with an ACEI 7 and ACE2 activity in the presence of either ACEI or ARBs in humans, in both scenarios the level of ACE2 does not show any change.46
As per Fang et al (2020), it was hypothesized that the use of ACE2 receptor increasing drugs is at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. ACEI initially inhibits ACE leading to decreased angiotensin I levels, causing a possible negative feedback loop that ultimately up-regulates more ACE2 receptor to be able to interact with the decreased angiotensin I substrate available."

        Hand sanitizers have become a popular defense to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19, but experts warn of some varieties that contain the hidden ingredient methanol, which could be dangerous for children. Hand sanitizers have become a successful defense against the coronavirus, so much so that for a short time, it was difficult to find them on store shelves. More recently, they’ve been easier to find, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is raising concerns about certain hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Kenya M. Parks, MD “While we want to encourage the use of hand sanitizers among our patient population to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19, we want to warn them against some of these products that include methanol, a substance that can be life-threatening when absorbed via the skin or ingested,” said Kenya Maria Parks, MD, FAAP, a pediatrician at UT Physicians and assistant professor of pediatrics at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth. The FDA is currently investigating the use of methanol in these hand sanitizers, which are primarily manufactured in Mexico."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This research, however, has been undertaken by a cannabis research and development company based in Israel, and not independently verified by other scientific studies that are not linked to the cannabis industry. At this point, there is insufficient independent research to make any claims about the use of cannabis in preventing, treating, or curing COVID-19. There is no reliable evidence so far to suggest that cannabis can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. One pre-print (a type of study that is yet to be peer-reviewed) from Canada suggests possible anti-inflammatory properties in cannabis may be effective in future treatments of the disease. The study also suggests that cannabis could be used to prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells in the human body by interacting with the ACE2 receptor protein, which is found on the surface of many cells."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Better health. Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►
Is chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine useful in treating people with COVID-19, or in preventing infection in people who have been exposed to the virus? COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. If the infection becomes severe, people may need intensive care and support in hospital, including mechanical ventilation.Drugs used for other diseases were tried out in COVID-19, and this included chloroquine, used for malaria; and hydroxychloroquine used for rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The authors sought evidence of the effects of these drugs in treating people ill with the disease; in preventing the disease in people at risk of getting the disease, such as health workers; and people exposed to the virus developing the disease.Key messages
Hydroxychloroquine does not reduce deaths from COVID-19, and probably does not reduce the number of people needing mechanical ventilation. Hydroxychloroquine caused more unwanted effects than a placebo treatment, though it did not appear to increase the number of serious unwanted effects."

Evidence:"What are monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibodies (mAB) are laboratory-made proteins that help fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Although mAB treatment is not a cure, it may lessen the severity of symptoms and help keep high-risk patients out of the hospital. Treatments vary depending on whether they are administered as part of Pre-Exposure Prophylactics (PrEP) or Post-Exposure Prophylactics (PEP), though currently there are no approved therapies for PEP. Pre-exposure Treatments
Some immunocompromised individuals who have no known exposure to COVID-19 or with a negative COVID-19 test may have previously received pre-exposure treatment. Currently, there are no authorized pre-exposure treatments available in the United States."

Evidence:"Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid which cannot be made from the body. It can be found in many foods such as plant oils, nuts, flaxseeds and seafoods. They are an important component of cell membranes and are associated with a lower risk of several diseases.In a pilot study published in the journal Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids, investigators provided the first bits of evidence that individuals with higher levels of omega-3 in their blood may potentially be at a reduced risk of dying from COVID-19.In a conversation with two of the lead authors, William Harris, PhD, a professor of internal medicine at the University of South Dakota and Michael Myers, MD, a physician at the Los Alamitos Medical Center, they discuss the important findings from their study.“What we found was that people in the highest quartile of Omega-3s, 1 person died, and in the lower 3 quartiles, 13 people died,” Harris said. “ When we did the statistics, we found that it wasn’t quite statistically significant by standard metrics, but it was very close to it.”“It is most likely very real, we're working on trying to do a larger and more detailed study to confirm everything,” Myers said.Related VideosView AllRelated ContentWorld Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023Related Content World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023ArticlesHow Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022Podcasts “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023ArticlesCOVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022PodcastsAs US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023ArticlesEnoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023ArticlesAbout UsAdvertiseEditorialContact UsDo Not Sell My InformationPrivacyTerms & ConditionsContact Info2 Clarke Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2023 MJH Life Sciences   All rights reserved."
