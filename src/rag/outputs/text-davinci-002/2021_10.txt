Evidence:"There is only slight evidence that the Mini-Mental State Examination score in patients who received folic acid increased 0.3 point higher compared with the placebo group after 24 months (95% CI = −0.12 to 0.37; P = .31). There is very strong evidence that the concentration of homocysteine in the folic acid group became 6.16 μmol/L lower compared with the placebo group after 6 months (95% CI = 2.32 to 8.21 lower; P < .001).ConclusionsOur review shows the effectiveness of folic acid in lowering the plasma homocysteine concentration after 6 months compared with placebo. However, this effect was not accompanied by improvement in cognitive function.Study registration: CRD42020199433 https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/export_details_pdf.php) 
Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, folic acid, homocysteine, vascular cognitive impairmentSignificance StatementFolic acid is widely used as additional treatment for patients with cognitive impairment.Folic acid helps to reduce the concentration of the homocysteine level in plasma of patients with VCI.The change of cognitive function is not effectively shown for VCI patients who were treated with folic acid. Introduction
Recently, due to the improvement of medical services and healthcare coverage, the number of elderly people has increased globally alongside the increment in life expectancy. The incidences of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, ischemia, and stroke, have proportionally increased. One of these diseases is vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), which refers to all forms of cognitive disorders associated with cerebrovascular disease that result in a wide range of cognitive deficits (Dichgans and Leys 2017)."

Evidence:"It is often called the "duct tape" method.Cut a piece of duct tape as close to the size of the wart as possible.Leave the tape in place for 6 days. If the tape falls off, put on a new piece.After 6 days, remove the tape and soak the area in water. Leave the tape off overnight.Repeat this process until the wart is gone, but not longer than 2 months.Covering a wart with tape may help it go away. However, there isn't proof that using duct tape helps to clear up warts more quickly than leaving them alone.Using duct tape for warts is probably safe. But if your skin is very thin or fragile, be very careful when removing the tape.If you're not sure whether a skin growth is a wart, it's best to see a health professional.Related InformationWarts and Plantar WartsWarts: Should I Treat Warts?CreditsCurrent as of:  November 15, 2021 Author: Healthwise StaffMedical Review: Patrice Burgess MD - Family MedicineDonald Sproule MDCM, CCFP - Family MedicineAdam Husney MD - Family MedicineMartin J.

Evidence:"Red blood cells require B12 for their development. So, people with pernicious anaemia end up with anaemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. While patients with vitiligo are more likely to have pernicious anaemia, B12 injections are only helpful if tests confirm pernicious anaemia and B12 deficiency.Many website and sources recommend vitamin D supplementation but this is only needed if vitamin D levels are found to be low. Those with skin of colour (pigmented skin types) need more sunlight exposure than white skin to make vitamin D and those with vitiligo are more likely to burn in the sun. For these reasons, it is a good idea to have your vitamin D checked and supplemented it if the levels are below normal.Research has shown that early in the disease process vitiligo may be partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in the pigment cell (melanocyte) and for this reason, some people will advocate taking anti-oxidants to “boost the immune system.” But vitiligo is not due to a ‘low’ or ‘poor immune system,” it is due to an immune system that is misbehaving! Having said this, there is one research paper that emerged from a European group suggesting that vitamin C, E and alpha lipoic acid may be helpful in the early stages of vitiligo but these patients were also treated with phototherapy (narrow band UVB 311nm)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Learn more below. Busting the ‘Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever’ Myth
The first thing to note is that fever itself is not actually an illness, while a cold is. Colds are caused by viruses and may result in a number of unpleasant symptoms – including a stuffy nose, coughing, sore throat and, very occasionally, fever.1 A fever, however, can be a symptom of a cold, the flu or any kind of bacterial or viral infection.2,3
Colds and the Flu Need Fluids to Help Treat Them
One of the most important steps in helping to treat cold and flu symptoms, including fever, is to keep up your fluid intake to help prevent dehydration.1,4 This can be done by drinking water or other liquids, such as tea, broth or soup.4,5
And because your body needs fluids to support its recovery, ‘starving’ it of this essential hydration will do little to help treat the cause of your fever – and instead may even keep you from feeling better.5
Nutritious Foods Can Help to Support Your Immune System
Another reason not to act on the ‘feed a cold, starve a fever’ myth when you’re feeling ill is that certain foods can actually help to support our immune systems. A healthy and strong immune system can help to protect you from cold and flu viruses in the first place.6
Vitamin C is vital for immune function – as well as bone structure, iron absorption and healthy skin. But since our bodies don’t produce vitamin C naturally, we have to get it from either our diet or vitamin supplements. This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7
A nutritious diet that is high in fruits and vegetables is also one of the easiest ways to help support your immune system and general health – whether you have a cold, fever or neither – so it isn’t wise to starve your body of these foods at any time.8
This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7
Feeding Colds and Fever – Listen to Your Body 
Ultimately, if you are suffering from a cold or a fever, it’s important to listen to your body when it comes to food.3
Since our immune systems do need nutrients, it’s a good idea to keep up some calorie intake when you’re not feeling well – if you have the appetite."

no

 Basic characteristics of mothers receiving zinc supplement and those receiving placebo
There was no significant difference in the birth weights (and other anthropometric data) of the zinc supplemented group compared with the placebo group (table 2). The effect of various potential confounders on birth weight was assessed by linear regression analysis including age, sex, serum zinc concentration, haemoglobin status, gestation at delivery, height, weight, and body mass index of mother, and education, dietary intake, and socioeconomic status of parents. Low body mass index and prematurity were significantly associated with birth weight when all other factors were taken into account (p  =  0.01), and low maternal education was associated but did not reach statistical significance (p  =  0.07).View this table:View inline

DISCUSSION
We show that supplementing pregnant women with a daily oral dose of 20 mg elemental zinc throughout their pregnancies beginning at 12 weeks gestation did not result in a significant change in the birth weight.

Evidence:"Vitamin E has a long history of studies about fading scars and dark spots due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammation effects. It not only contains antioxidants, it increases cell turnover, boots the skin’s regeneration process and diminishes hyperpigmentation, but also supports collagen production.

The article claims that its anti-antioxidant properties help stabilize cell membranes, including cells of the inflammatory process, and thus reduce the amounts of chemicals released by those cells.” Furthermore, Vitamin E is also praised for other things like its moisturising and soothing benefits, especially for delicate or damaged skin. With this anti-inflammatory effect, vitamin E is able to calm irritated skin and deeply nourish dry skin. What’s the best Vitamin E cream on the market?"

Evidence:"But people who find themselves suffering from winter-induced depression have other treatment options that don’t require sitting in blindingly white rooms. Light boxes, or light therapy lamps, have become increasingly popular in recent years, especially in the US, and even among people who haven’t been officially diagnosed with SAD. Google searches for “lamp for seasonal affective disorder” have skyrocketed since 2016, according to Google Trends — perhaps not surprisingly, people tend to look into buying these products in November and December, and people in northern states with rough winters, like Minnesota and Michigan, are the ones driving the most search traffic. The Cut, the Wirecutter, and CNN have compiled lists of the best SAD lamps, which range from sleek light boxes that fit on your desk to floor lamps. Sharkey, the Brown University psychiatrist, said light therapy can be a very effective treatment for patients who have been diagnosed with SAD, adding that Hattar’s and Sanes’s respective studies were a huge breakthrough in understanding how SAD works. The mouse study, she said, was “probably the most exciting paper I’ve seen in the last year.”

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Researchers believe that minoxidil might increase the flow of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles, stimulating hair growth. The drug encourages hair follicles to enter the growth phase of the hair cycle (called the anagen phase) and stay there longer, resulting in both longer and thicker hair. Unlike finasteride (another hair loss medication; see Important Safety Information), minoxidil has no effect on hormones (like dihydrotestosterone or DHT) (Badri, 2021). Benefits and effectiveness of minoxidil
Minoxidil is effective at slowing hair loss and encouraging new and thicker hair growth. Studies show that 5% minoxidil seems to work better than the 2% formulation for treating hair loss (Suchonwanit, 2019). Rogaine tends to be more effective in younger men (meaning those under 40) who have been balding for less than five years."

The Hoxsey Therapy, a mixture of herbs, was first marketed as a purported cure for cancer in the 1920's by Harry Hoxsey, a vaudevillian with no medical or scientific education, and Norman Baker, a radio personality. Hoxsey himself traced the treatment to his great-grandfather, who observed a horse with a tumor on its leg cure itself by grazing upon wild plants growing in the meadow."

Evidence:"The tendency of L-theanine to increase alpha waves may explain its stress and anxiety reducing effects.

Evidence:"Research suggests that exercising regularly can boost mental clarity and improve working memory and attention span (24, 25).In addition, exercise has been shown to help reduce cognitive decline in adults over age 50 (26, 27).While regular exercise can provide several general mental health benefits, it can also help relieve the symptoms of some specific mental health conditions, which we will look at in depth below.SummaryThe most commonly experienced, science-backed benefits of physical activity on mental health are reductions in stress, improved self-confidence, improved mood, better sleep quality, sharper memory, and clearer thinking.Exercise and depressionDepression is a common mental health condition worldwide, with about 5% of the global adult population experiencing it in varying degrees (28).The main symptoms are (28):depressed moodloss of interest in previously pleasurable activitieslow self-worthdisrupted sleepthoughts of suicide Regular exercise has been repeatedly shown to help manage symptoms of depression, with the most significant benefits being higher self-esteem, better life satisfaction, and fewer negative thoughts (29).In fact, a 2018 research review found that aerobic exercise in particular can have antidepressant effects (30).Exercise may decrease depressive thoughts by increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, an important protein in your brain that’s responsible for learning and cell growth (31, 32).While aerobic exercise has been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression, any type of exercise — from running to playing basketball or lifting weights — is likely helpful.Exercise and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)ADHD is a common mental health condition (33).People who have ADHD may experience difficulty paying attention, impulsive behavior, and overactivity. The cause is an imbalance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain, primarily dopamine (34).ADHD is often treated with medications to promote concentration and reduce impulsive behavior, but research suggests that exercise can be an excellent complementary treatment for ADHD.Specifically, physical exercise has been shown to help regulate dopamine levels in the brain, improve executive functions, and improve attention in children and adults with ADHD (35, 36, 37). While most studies use aerobic exercise in ADHD interventions, it’s important to incorporate a combination of aerobic (cardio) and resistance training into your exercise routine to maximize the health benefits (38).Exercise and anxietyWhile we all may feel anxious at times, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined as experiencing excessive anxiety or worry most days for at least 6 months.Some common symptoms of GAD are (39):restlessnessfatigueirritabilitysleeplessnessMedications, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and meditation are common treatment methods.One alternative method of managing the symptoms of GAD is regularly engaging in purposeful exercise.In fact, a 2018 research review found exercise to be a viable treatment method for anxiety disorder and concluded that higher intensity exercise was more beneficial than lower intensity regimens (40). Therefore, regular exercise seems to be a viable alternative treatment option for anxiety disorder in combination with prescribed medications.Exercise and bipolar disorderBipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes unusual shifts in mood and energy levels, impacts your ability to concentrate, and may impact your ability to complete everyday tasks (41).This condition in commonly characterized by episodes of depression and mania, although in some cases symptoms are mixed.Traditional treatment methods include mood-stabilizing or antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy.In addition to traditional treatment methods, exercise has been shown to help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder (42). More specifically, regular physical activity may help reduce shifts in mood and promote an improved sense of well-being in people with bipolar disorder (43). Many of the medications commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder list weight gain as a side effect, and regular exercise may also help limit this effect (44).Exercise and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)OCD is a condition that can cause uncontrollable recurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that you feel the urge to repeat over and over (45).Depending on the severity, this disorder can affect all aspects of life, including work, school, and home life.The most common treatment approach is medication — such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) — paired with CBT, a type of psychotherapy that targets specific behaviors.A popular alternative treatment method for OCD is a regimented exercise program.In a 2017 study in 56 adults with OCD, researchers noted a significant reduction in OCD symptoms following a 12-week aerobic exercise program."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Few methods for tick removal that have been reported in the literature have scientific support. Some methods that are not recommended (Table 1) include applying a hot match or nail to the tick body; covering the tick with petroleum jelly, nail polish, alcohol or gasoline; using injected or topical lidocaine (Xylocaine); or passing a suture needle through the tick.8–15 Although there is conflicting evidence as to whether the removal technique influences infection rates,6,10,16 these methods may induce the tick to salivate and regurgitate into the attachment site, theoretically increasing the risk of infection.8,11 
Do not use sharp forceps.Do not crush, puncture, or squeeze the tick's body.Do not apply substances such as petroleum jelly, gasoline, lidocaine (Xylocaine), etc., to the tick.Do not apply heat with a match or hot nail.Do not use a twisting or jerking motion to remove the tick.Do not handle the tick with bare hands. Commercially available tick-removal devices include the Sawyer Tick Pliers (B&A Products, Bunch, Okla.), Pro-Tick Remedy (SCS Limited, Stony Point, N.Y.) and Ticked Off (Ticked Off Inc., Dover, N.H.). Although one study17 found that the Pro-Tick Remedy and Ticked Off devices left mouthparts in the skin less often, all three devices listed above were recommended over tweezers for tick removal. Another study2 recommended the Ticked Off device but did not compare it with other devices. There are other commercially available tick-removal devices, but no studies have evaluated their usefulness."

Evidence:"You may try home remedies like mayonnaise to kill lice, because lets face it, lice treatment can be pricey.But, can mayo kill lice? While researching this topic, my head began to itch just thinking about microscopic lice crawling around all over someone's head. Then, add in the discussion of using mayonnaise to suffocate the bugs and I feel like I may never use anything other than mustard on a sandwich ever again. I spoke with Krista Lauer, MD, National Medical Director for Lice Clinics of America to see if the old wives' tale holds any truth. "Mayonnaise is one of the numerous home head lice treatments that are purported to eradicate an infestation. The truth — there are only spotty anecdotal stories and no scientific evidence that mayonnaise is effective," Lauer tells Romper."

Evidence:"If you follow a plant-based diet, have certain health conditions, or are pregnant, you may need to adjust your iron intake. Benefits  
If you're anemic because of an iron deficiency, your healthcare provider will likely have you start by making changes to your diet. Research has shown that diet can be an effective route to manage iron deficiency anemia. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try the anemia diet before other treatments, as it often helps mild deficiency and doesn't have the side effects of oral iron supplementation. Eating more iron-rich foods (and avoiding those that inhibit iron absorption) is a good starting point even if you developed iron deficiency anemia for reasons aside from your eating habits. It may not be the only factor contributing to your anemia, it is one you can have some control over."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Key findings from clinical studies have shown that music therapy may be helpful for people with depression and anxiety, sleep disorders, and even cancer. Depression   
Studies have shown that music therapy can be an effective component of depression treatment. According to the research cited, the use of music therapy was most beneficial to people with depression when it was combined with the usual treatments (such as antidepressants and psychotherapy). When used in combination with other forms of treatment, music therapy may also help reduce obsessive thoughts, depression, and anxiety in people with OCD. In 2016, researchers conducted a feasibility study that explored how music therapy could be combined with CBT to treat depression. While additional research is needed, the initial results were promising."

Evidence:"Borderline personality disorder is a mental condition in which a person's personality becomes skewed and marked by periods of moodiness and impulsive aggression. Researchers say that treatment of the disorder with currently available medications provides only modest results. But studies have shown that populations that eat larger amounts of seafood tend to have lower rates of mental disorders linked to personality disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depression. This prompted researchers to investigate whether increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish would have any effect on symptoms. The study, published in the January 2003 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, compared the effects of daily fish oil supplementation (one gram of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or E-EPA) in 20 adult women with moderate borderline personality with 10 women who were given a placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, women who took the supplements had significantly diminished aggression as well as a drop in the severity of depression compared with the placebo group."

Evidence:"Regardless of these limitations, we still believe that the results of the present study are valid and contribute important information to the literature. Our results may encourage other researchers to investigate if there is a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and asthma. Also, further studies are required to investigate if vitamin D supplementation may improve asthma symptoms, general weakness, and musculoskeletal pain in patients with asthma.In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in the both participants with asthma and healthy controls, but serum levels of 25(OH)D among participants with asthma were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In addition, vitamin D deficiency symptoms including general weakness, musculoskeletal pain, and anxiety were highly prevalent among participants with asthma compared to healthy controls. Asthma was significantly associated with decreased serum 25(OH)D levels, and complaints of general weakness and musculoskeletal pain. In contrast, there was no significant association between asthma and either anxiety or depression."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In trials that lasted up to four weeks, people lost an average of just over 2kg. However, in the trials that continued for longer than four weeks, the average weight-loss was 0.8kg.Although these differences were statistically significant, the practical significance of such small amounts of weight-loss is questionable.The finding that the longer studies resulted in less weight loss was also discouraging. While many weight-loss supplements and diets result in initial success, long-term benefits are much more difficult to obtain yet are vital to long-term health.Some of the above trials also examined the impact of chitosan on serum cholesterol levels. The results were very similar to those with weight loss.A statistically significant reduction in cholesterol levels was found, but the benefits were much smaller in the high-quality trials and those that lasted longer.Problematic aspectsIn the controlled trials, participants taking chitosan reported similar adverse effects to those taking placebos. Concerns have been expressed that chitosan may bind fat-soluble vitamins resulting in lower intakes that might require vitamin supplementation.People with shellfish allergies should be cautious about chitosan, although such allergies are usually caused by components other than chitosan.Only high-quality supplements should be used to avoid concerns about trace contaminants from the shells.RecommendationsThere is some evidence that chitosan may help reduce the amount of fat absorbed into the body from the diet and so help to reduce weight. It appears to have few adverse effects.The evidence that chitosan lowers cholesterol levels is somewhat weaker."
