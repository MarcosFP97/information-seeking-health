Evidence:"The normal body temperature is between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C. With infection or other illnesses, various chemicals are released in our body. This re-adjusts the thermostat, resulting in fever.Fever factsFever is the body's way to fight infection. However, it is not just caused by infections alone.How high a fever it does not indicate the severity of the illness that is causing the fever.Overwrapping and a generally hot environment can cause the body temperature of a child to be slightly above normal.Fever caused by viral infections may persist for up to 5 to 7 days and will only completely settle when the viral fever has resolved.​High fever per se does not cause brain damage, though a small percentage between 6 months to 6 years may have seizures with high fever. However, febrile seizures usually do not lead to brain damage.Fever in children: Home remediesTepid spongingMay help if the temperature is more than 39.5 °C.Use tap or lukewarm water to sponge.Remove clothings, cover the child with towel, sponge and dry his face.Apply the cool compress to forehead, nape of neck, armpits and groin (see diagram).Proceed to sponge body starting with the front then to the back.Generally you should not sponge a child for more than 30 minutes at a stretch.Stop sponging when shivering occurs, or when the child turns blue.When your child shivers, cover him up and wait a while before resuming sponging.Encourage your child to take plenty of fluids.Dress your child in light clothings to allow heat exchange.Keep the room environment cool and well-ventilated to allow the ambient temperature to help bring the fever down.Click on page 2 to read about common fever medications and know when to consult a doctor.​

Evidence:"Folic Acid Function On Your Brain
Can Folic Acid Improve Cognitive Function? Folic acid has be used to treat people suffering from memory loss, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia for some time now. There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:
Improved memory
Better change in cognitive function
Significant difference in information processing

Evidence:"Is duct tape truly effective for common warts, and how is it applied?Answer Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are extremely common in children and are caused by the human papillomavirus. These benign lesions will resolve spontaneously and no therapy is recommended. Evidence for duct tape effectiveness is limited, but because this therapy is safe and well tolerated, parents can try it at home, as well as try using salicylic acid patches. With duct tape therapy, apply a small piece of duct tape directly on the wart once every 4 to 7 days; then remove the tape, clean the area with soap and water, and remove the dead skin using an emery board. Apply another piece of tape 12 hours later."

True or False: “Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever”
The saying “feed a cold, starve a fever” dates back to a dictionary published by John Withals in 1574 because of a note that indicated “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief that has carried through the years is that the body needs food to generate warmth for healing from a cold – while avoiding food helps to cool the body when a fever is present. False: Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever
Even though this medical folklore has been carried through the years, should we still be abiding by these recommendations? We live in a modern world filled with vast information about health and wellness. Science has examined this tradition and found that it is an old wives’ tale. In the 1500s and 1600s, doctors thought that a fever meant that the metabolism was working in overdrive. So, the idea was the withholding food would help the body to cool since the digestive system doesn’t need to work to break down the food."

        Abstract
BACKGROUND: 
Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. OBJECTIVES: 
This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. SEARCH STRATEGY: 
We searched the databases of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, and EMBASE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP)."
Question:Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"There is not enough evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in better outcomes for women and their babies. Finding ways to improve women's overall nutritional status, particularly in low-income areas, will do more to improve the health of mothers and babies than supplementing pregnant women with zinc alone. This should be an urgent research priority for the future. Authors' conclusions: 
There is not enough evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in improvements in maternal or neonatal outcomes. Future research to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of pregnant women, particularly in low-income regions, and not looking at zinc in isolation, should be an urgent priority.

Eczema is an itchy and, to some, an embarrassing skin ailment. Typical medial treatments like cortisone are less than ideal. So some people have turned to evening primrose oil, a remedy made from the seeds of a yellow wildlflower that are rich in the essential fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid. There's only problem: evening primrose oil doesn't seem to work.

Evidence:"Can I use vitamin e to treat scars? Many people believe that using vitamin E topically can help treat scars on the skin, however it has been found that applying vitamin E before scar tissue forms can reduce scar formation. However, there is no concrete evidence that using vitamin E to treat scars that have formed on the skin is effective. In addition, the excessive use of vitamin E on the skin can also cause skin inflammation, allergies, and the effectiveness of scar reduction when applying vitamin E oil is not really clear, depending on the location. Using vitamin E when having acne has not shown any real effect, but applying vitamin E to the skin can also make the skin sticky, which can make acne not improve but sometimes even increase. Therefore, before using topical products on the skin to treat scars or acne, it is necessary to consider its effectiveness and potential risks."

        Abstract
      Previous studies have suggested that probiotic fermented milk may possess blood pressure (BP)-lowering properties. In the present study, we aimed to systematically examine the effect of probiotic fermented milk on BP by conducting a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. PubMed, Cochrane library and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to March 2012 to identify eligible studies.The reference lists of the obtained articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate the combined treatment effect. Meta-analysis of fourteen randomised placebo-controlled trials involving 702 participants showed that probiotic fermented milk, compared with placebo, produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg (95% CI 24·64, 21·56) in systolic BP and 1·09 mmHg (95% CI 22·11, 20·06) in diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses suggested a slightly greater effect on systolic BP in hypertensive participants than in normotensive ones (23·98 v. 22·09 mmHg)."

Evidence:"Thus, yoga incorporates several elements of exercise that may be beneficial for arthritis.To cope with pain, arthritis patients often reduce activity 10;11. However, inactivity can result in muscle or tendon shortening, articular capsule contraction and weakened ligaments 12. Conversely, regular activity may decrease pain and preserve stability 13;14.While there was once concern that exercise might increase inflammation and exacerbate pain, regular physical activity is now recommended as part of comprehensive treatment of arthritis 15-18. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 19, Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 20 and the Ottawa Panel 21 note that stretching, strengthening and conditioning exercises can preserve physical function, increase strength and improve endurance for people with arthritis. All persons with arthritis should consult with their doctor to determine a safe and appropriate approach to increasing physical activityUnfortunately, long term exercise maintenance is uncommon even for healthy individuals, generally approaching 50% after six months 22. Vigorous exercise is ideal for physical health 23 and may be acceptable for some persons with arthritis 24;25, but could be intolerable and may not be recommended for those with significant joint instability or damage 26;27."

Evidence:"In view of these patient preferences, and in line with the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine issued by the IHS (IHS 2000), the main outcomes that we considered were:     pain‐free at two hours, without the use of rescue medication;   reduction in headache pain ('headache relief') at two hours (pain reduced from moderate or severe to none or mild without the use of rescue medication). We also collected data for pain‐free and headache relief outcomes at one hour if reported. Secondary outcomes We considered the following secondary outcomes:    sustained pain‐free during the 24 hours post dose (pain‐free within two hours, with no use of rescue medication or recurrence of moderate to severe pain within 24 hours);    sustained headache relief during the 24 hours post dose (headache relief at two hours, sustained for 24 hours, with no use of rescue medication or a second dose of study medication);    adverse events: participants with any adverse event during the 24 hours post dose; serious adverse events; adverse events leading to withdrawal. Other outcomes We also collected data for other outcomes, where reported, including:    use of rescue medication;   relief of headache‐associated symptoms;   relief of functional disability. PI or PR had to be measured by the participant (not the investigator or care provider). We accepted the following pain measures for the main efficacy outcomes:     PI: 4‐point categorical scale, with wording equivalent to none, mild, moderate, and severe; or 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), where less than 30 mm was considered equivalent to mild or no pain and 30 mm or greater equivalent to moderate or severe pain (Collins 1997);    PR: 5‐point categorical scale, with wording equivalent to none, a little, some, a lot, and complete; or 100 mm VAS, where less than 30 mm was considered equivalent to none or a little, and 30 mm or greater equivalent to some, a lot, or complete."

This may include switching medications and making lifestyle changes, such as reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption, increasing the amount of exercise, and eating a heart-healthy diet.View Large

Evidence:"To complement this, there are also holistic treatments and natural health products which can help to ease inflammation and pain. Holistic Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis
In terms of the treatments I offer, the most useful is Aromatherapy massage
With aromatherapy massage, there are a number of beneficial effects for sufferers of RA:
1) pain relief and decreased stiffness, increased mobility in the joints from the massage 
2) reduction of inflammation due to the use of essential oils in the massage oil. Essential oils are absorbed into the bloodstream during an aromatherapy massage and so continue to work after your treatment has ended. 3) improvement in mood levels due to the release of the "happy" hormones during massage
Please note, during an acute flare up where the joints are very painful, massage would not be advisable. In such cases, I would advise Reiki as this doesn't involve any massage or manipulation of the body, is deeply relaxing, can bring pain relief and can also help to improve mood levels. Reiki can also be carried out in a comfortable chair for those who find it painful to lie down on a massage couch."

Evidence:"Researchers observed that people who had alopecia and used minoxidil for hypertension experienced hair regrowth, and the world’s most popular over-the-counter treatment for alopecia was born. People have been using minoxidil to treat hair loss since 1986. The way that minoxidil works isn’t completely clear. What’s apparent is that minoxidil decreases hair loss in some people while also increasing hair growth. It doesn’t work for everyone.Minoxidil is also classed as a vasodilator, meaning that it dilates your blood vessels so that blood flows more easily where it’s applied. An increase in blood circulation to your scalp could be part of why minoxidil increases hair growth."

Evidence:"History:Harry Hoxsey a miner, developed a herbal formula that he believed was a help to people with cancer. According to his autobiography, it was his great-grandfather, a horse breeder named John Hoxsey, who originated it in the mid-nineteenth century, out of grasses and flowering wild plants which John took from the pasture where a favourite stallion, afflicted with a cancerous growth, grazed daily until the growth necrotised. According to Harry, John Hoxsey reasoned that the wild plants had caused the stallion’s recovery. He therefore concocted a liquid out of red clover and alfalfa, buckthorn and prickly ash (and other plants which John could not identify), gathered from the area where the stallion had apparently cured himself. Although he was not a doctor, Harry Hoxsey treated thousands of cancer patients."

Evidence:"At present, acetaminophen (up to 4,000 mg/daily) is the recommended initial analgesic of choice for symptomatic OA. ( ACR Guidelines-Guidelines for Medical Management of OA of the knee) However, many patients eventually require NSAIDs or more potent analgesics to control pain. 2) Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been an important treatment for the symptoms of OA for a very long time. The mechanism by which NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects is via inhibition of the prostaglandin-generating enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX) . In addition to their inflammatory potential, prostaglandins also contribute to important homeostatic functions, such as maintenance of the gastric lining, renal blood flow, and platelet aggregation. Reduction of prostaglandin levels in these organs can result in the well-recognized side effects of traditional non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naprosyn, indomethacin) – that is, gastric ulceration, renal insufficiency, and prolonged bleeding time."

Evidence:"Instead of soy, hypoallergenic formulas are recommended.Giving an infant soy in the early months before intestinal closure may predispose the infant to soy allergies later on. Since soy is used as a filler in so many foods in the American diet, this is a serious concern.Soy formulas contain around 33 percent more sodium than standard cow’s milk- based formulas, and formulas in general are saltier than human milk. It is nutritionally unwise to shape young palates to get accustomed to salty tastes. It’s unwise to give a baby a salty formula unless absolutely necessary.Carbohydrate sources in soy formulas are even more of a concern. Just as there is a whey war going on between formula companies, there now seems to be a sugar war, too. Enfamil now advertises “no table sugar” in their soy formula, Prosobee, so they use corn syrup instead of sucrose."
