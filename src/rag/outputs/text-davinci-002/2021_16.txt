Evidence:"Physical therapy and massage that promote gently stretching (and later strengthening) of your calf muscles can be beneficial. Wearing a compression sock, ankle brace, or walking boot to provide support and to prevent heel movement is also very helpful. There are many ankle supports designed specifically for Achilles Tendonitis to counteract irritation to the tendon, through support and compression. For more severe issues (and following surgery) a rigid boot with a 'wedge' can be used to keep the ankle in a slightly flexed (foot pointed down) position to protect the tendon from overstretching while it heals. Here are some examples of Ankle supports for Achilles Tendonitis:

Evidence:"1. Sandpaper and duct tape
A combination of sandpaper and duct tape is one wart removal remedy that is more likely to work than others, so get ready to head to your local hardware store. “Keep the wart covered with duct tape 24 hours a day,” says Dr. Piliang. “If the tape falls off, you need to quickly replace it. The skin underneath will become wet, pale and wrinkled, and warts dislike that. Keep it on for two to three weeks, and if the wart looks smaller, then continue using the duct tape until it goes away.”
Once the wart is white and soft, you can gently rub it with sandpaper to remove the outer layer."

Evidence:"(1) Another from 2016 came upon similar results, finding moderate evidence that yoga provides some benefits to those living with asthma. (2)
With the guidance of a yoga therapist, people with asthma can promote more effective breathing and develop their breath control through yogic breathing exercises. People with asthma often find their body has to work harder to breathe correctly, and they may develop more anxiety concerning their breath, which can exacerbate symptoms. Techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing can open airways, strengthen abdominal muscles and improve heart and lung function, potentially soothing asthma symptoms and making sufferers feel more in control. As stress is a trigger (and can exacerbate other triggers) of asthma attacks, yoga’s function of calming people’s nervous system and relieving panic can be extremely valuable for those living with asthma. For most people, having an asthma attack can be extremely frightening, and over time fear of symptoms may grow."

This, however, is a remedy of the past that should stay there. Starving is not recommended for treating any sickness. In fact, it can actually deprive your body of what it needs to fight off infection, delaying your recovery.﻿﻿
   Why It Doesn't Work  
When your body is combating a cold, it needs energy in the form of calories to fight off infection and recover. The same applies when you have a fever—and it may be even more important in that case. A fever is just one of the ways your immune system fights off infection. When your body temperature is higher than normal, your immune system ramps up its production of the antibodies it needs to do its job."

Evidence:"Fortunately, birth control can also help prevent ovarian cysts and can even help to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. If women have been diagnosed with ovarian cysts, or are at an increased risk, they should strongly consider taking birth control.

Evidence:"If your doctor suspects a serious zinc depletion or you also suffer with fibroids, you may need to take as much as 30 mg to provide your body with the amount it needs. Just be sure to also take a multi-vitamin containing copper (especially if using a higher zinc dosage), since zinc can cause a copper deficiency in some people. Adding more zinc to your system may not guarantee a pregnancy, but it sure can help to ensure that you have all of the minerals your body needs to produce strong eggs and sperm and is prepared as best as it can be for the job of building a baby ahead.

Evidence:"Magnesium
This mineral, which is found in the body and in many foods, especially high-fiber ones, works by activating enzymes in the body and is crucial to nerve transmission and other important functions. People with migraines may have lower levels of magnesium than those who don't have migraines, which is why it may be effective. The best evidence comes from a 1996 study in Cephalalgia of 81 patients who were given either 600 mg of magnesium or a placebo every day for 12 weeks. In the magnesium group, the frequency of attacks was reduced by 41.6 percent during weeks 9 through 12 and by 15.8 percent in the placebo group. Those taking magnesium also had fewer migraine days and took fewer drugs to treat symptoms. Recommended dose: 600 mg daily for prevention."

      Exercise and sport
You can exercise and do sports if you have type 1 diabetes. You'll just have to take some extra steps to make sure you do it safely.Exercise and sport can affect your blood glucose levels. Depending on the type of activity you do, it may cause your blood glucose levels to rise (hyperglycaemia) or drop (hypoglycaemia).Moderate exercise that lasts a while, like walking or cycling, can cause a slow drop in blood glucose levels.Some exercise, like running or football, might cause your blood glucose levels to rise.There are things you can do to help you manage your blood glucose levels.You can avoid hypos by eating the right amount of carbs before, during and after exercise.You should adjust your insulin and check your blood glucose regularly. Your diabetes team can help.Exercise affects everyone differently and it might take a little while to find out what works for you. But try to stick with it.Exercise is not only good for your physical and mental health, it also helps reduce glucose spikes after meals.As a general rule:check your blood glucose level before and during exercise – this'll help you work out what you should eat and when to adjust your insulinrecord your blood glucose levels and what you eat when you exercise – share this with your diabetes team to help find what works for youcheck your blood glucose levels regularly after exercise (they can drop up to 12 hours after exercise) – you may need to take extra carbohydrate or a lower dose of insulin before bedif you exercise, it's likely you'll need extra carbohydrate to prevent hyposdrink plenty of water while you exercise

Evidence:"This fermented milk drink has been shown to bring many health benefits, and now, researchers explain how it could protect cardiovascular health.Share on PinterestKefir is a tasty, healthful drink that works wonders for our gut microbiota. This, it turns out, could also keep cardiovascular problems at bay.Kefir is a milk-based drink made by adding kefir grains — whitish grains obtained through the fermentation of specific bacteria and yeast — that allow it to obtain the specific creamy thickness and slightly sour taste.This probiotic drink has traditionally been tied to numerous benefits — especially its wholesome effects on the gut microbiome and digestion.But now we know that the bacteria in our guts influence more than just a good digestion.The microorganisms that populate our guts have been shown to communicate with the brain, which gives them the potential to influence plenty of processes in our body.A study from last year even showed that people with coronary heart disease exhibited differences in the composition of their gut microbiota, compared with people without this condition.Probiotics to the rescue?Another paper, this one published in the journal Nature, noted that a well-balanced gut microbiome could protect against high blood pressure, though the underlying biological mechanisms through which it is able to accomplish this remained unclear.Yet this discovery led the study’s authors to hypothesize that we could wield probiotic supplements as a weapon against hypertension, as they would promote healthful bacterial diversity.“I think,” said one of the scientists, “certainly there’s some promise in developing probiotics that could be targeted to possibly fixing some of the effects of a high-salt diet [responsible for high blood pressure].”However, researchers at Auburn University in Alabama and the University of Vila Velha in Espirito Santo, Brazil, are taking the question closer to home.In a recent study, they worked with a rat model to see whether kefir’s probiotic properties would influence gut health and help to lower blood pressure.Their findings were presented earlier this week at the annual Experimental Biology conference, held in San Diego, CA.From gut to brain to cardiovascular systemIn order to see whether, and how, a diet that consistently integrated kefir would influence blood pressure, the team — which was led by Mirian Silva-Cutini, of Auburn University — worked with three different groups of rats:Those in the first group had high blood pressure, and they were given kefir on a regular basis for a period of 9 weeks.Those in the second group also had high blood pressure, but they were not given kefir.Those in the third group had no blood pressure problems, and they were not given kefir (the controls).After the 9-week period, stool and blood samples were taken taken from all the rats in order to establish which changes had — or had not — occurred in their gut microbiota, and to test for specific toxins that might be released by some bacteria.Blood pressure was also measured, and the team used “immunofluorescence” to look at patterns of neural changes in the hypothalamus. This region of the brain plays an important role in regulating some basic processes in the body, including blood pressure.Silva-Cutini and colleagues discovered that the rats who had regularly been consuming kefir for 9 weeks exhibited lower levels of endotoxins, which are harmful substances that are a byproduct of bacterial disintegration. Endotoxins are known to contribute to inflammation.The same rats also presented lower blood pressure and had an improved intestinal structure, as the permeability — that is, how easily various microbes and substances can leak into the system — of the intestines was lowered.Another finding was that kefir-drinking rats had regained the balance of helpful bacteria in the gut microbiota, and the level of inflammation in their central nervous systems was reduced.The results indicate that kefir’s effect on gut bacteria is reflected in the kinds of signals transmitted by the brain to the rest of the system. Thus, a balanced gut microbiome appears to influence the brain to lower blood pressure to healthy levels.“Our data suggests that kefir antihypertensive-associated mechanisms involve gut microbiota-brain axis communication during hypertension,” the researchers conclude.HypertensionCardiovascular / CardiologyInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesNutrition / DietShare this articleBy Maria Cohut, Ph.D. on April 27, 2018 — Fact checked by Jasmin CollierLatest newsAlzheimer's: Does genetic predisposition to ADHD increase risk later in life?Are meat substitutes missing key nutrients, and if so, which?New PTSD treatment avenue?

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It’s characterized by a long list of symptoms, similar to those of depression, that usually occur in fall and winter “due to the shortening in day length and lower light intensity,” according to Hanne M. Hoffman, an assistant professor at Michigan State University who studies how light affects our physiology. Symptoms of SAD can include feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, difficulty concentrating, and the loss of libido, to name a few, says Dr. Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Norman E. Rosenthal, the clinician and researcher credited with discovering SAD, also says that many may feel less energetic and have a greater need for sleep and an increased appetite — “especially for sweets and starches.” If you think you might be suffering from SAD, the best first step is to talk to your doctor or therapist. The most common treatment for SAD is light therapy, a.k.a. “SAD lamps.” These lamps are specially “designed to mimic sunlight” and when used correctly, can cause chemical changes in the brain, tricking it into thinking it’s summer so it will release much-needed serotonin. But according to Janna Gordon-Elliott, a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork–Presbyterian, SAD lamps aren’t regulated by the FDA, so it’s important to not just “buy the cheapest thing on Amazon or the thing that’s more portable.” With that said, the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, a nonprofit research and education institution and the leading authority on SAD and light therapy, does offer guidance on what to look for in a legitimate SAD lamp as well as other helpful resources."
Question:Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression? The answer must be yes or no.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"They all work best if you use them when the migraine is just beginning. Start with a non-prescription pain drug like acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If these are not helpful, you can try other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some of which need a prescription, like diclofenac potassium and naproxen sodium. If these drugs do not help, or your headaches are more severe, try one of the prescription migraine drugs called triptans, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex and generic). If a triptan is helpful but not as effective as you would like, you may combine a triptan with an NSAID (take them simultaneously). If the above options are not helpful, you can try dihydroergotamine nasal spray (Migranal)."

Details for This Review
Study Population: Healthy children and adults from six countries at average risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)
Efficacy End Points: Incidence of URTI, duration of illness, work or school days lost
Harm End Points: Medication adverse effects
Narrative: Most treatments of URTI aim to control symptoms, because URTIs tend to self-remit in a few days to a week. It has been suggested that certain probiotic agents have the potential to prevent and mitigate URTI through immune-modulating properties. This Cochrane review examined 12 randomized trials (n = 3,720) of probiotics vs. placebo to prevent URTI.1 Included trials variably enrolled healthy children, adults, and older adults, while excluding trials examining persons at low risk (competitive athletes) and high risk (children prone to otitis). The studies demonstrated a reduction in episodes (number needed to treat to prevent one URTI = 8 during at least three months of treatment) and duration of URTI (mean difference = −1.89 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.03 to −1.75)."

Evidence:"Minoxidil—a drug normally used topically to treat hair loss—is beginning to gain traction as an oral medicine for the same reason. Some dermatologists even say that the drug in its oral form regrows hair better (and for less money) than how it's commonly used. The news comes from a recent article from The New York Times, highlighting the use of low-dose oral minoxidil pills—a relatively unknown hair loss treatment by both patients and doctors. Prescribing medication in this way is what's known as off-label use. Though minoxidil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss in topical form (it's the active ingredient in Rogaine), it has not been approved for oral use for hair loss. The drug is, however, FDA-approved as an oral treatment for high blood pressure, in higher doses."

Evidence:"Green tea, black tea, and certain types of mushroom naturally contain L-theanine.L-theanine may affect the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. These include serotonin and dopamine, which influence mood, sleep, and emotion, and cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress.A change in the balance of these chemicals can change a person’s mood or stress levels.Small studies and tests on animals have shown that L-theanine may offer a range of benefits. Experts consider it to be generally safe, but there is currently a lack of high-quality research in humans to confirm its benefits.What are the benefits of L-theanine?The following sections discuss the existing evidence for the possible benefits of L-theanine.1. Better mental focusMany people drink black or green tea while at work, believing that it boosts their mental focus. A 2012 study supports this idea.The researchers found that people who took 100 milligrams (mg) of L-theanine made fewer errors in an attention task than those in the placebo group. Drinking 50 mg of caffeine or combining the L-theanine and caffeine also improved people’s focus.More research is necessary to determine how L-theanine might affect a person’s attention and focus.2."

Evidence:"Although in another study, there were only small effect in favor of exercise in the inhibition of depression, the small sample size, a high heterogeneity in the participants, interventions and methods of measurement may limit the ability to draw positive results (73). In addition, studies from different countries and regions supported the beneficial of regular exercise on depression. A study including 312 Spanish patients with clinically significant depression over 65 years old reported that at least 60 min daily moderate-intensity regular exercise (muscle strengthening, aerobic exercise, flexibility and balance exercises) could significantly alleviate depression symptoms (60). An 8 year follow-up study in Finland found persons with dyskinesia and a sedentary lifestyle were at higher risk for depression compared with physically active individuals with intact mobility (74). A prospective cohort study from Taiwan reported that three times a week of moderate intensity (at least 15 min per time) continuous exercise could significantly decrease the risk of depressive symptoms, suggesting moderate-intensity regular exercise was beneficial way to improve mental health (61). Furthermore, a study in Myanmar and Vietnam found participant with less sedentary behavior and high physical activity were at lower risk of having depression (62)."

Evidence:"They cannot be caught from animals.More than half of all 4 to 11 year-olds catch head lice every year, while symptoms often include an itchy scalp or feeling that your scalp is moving, some people don’t report any symptoms.A close-up photo of a head louse [Photo: Getty]How to treat head liceSo if mayonnaise and garlic don’t work what should parents be doing to get rid of head lice?According to Shamir Patel, founder of Chemist 4 U one of the best ways to get rid of head lice is by a process known as wet combing.“The only DIY treatment I would recommend is conditioner and wet combing," he tells Yahoo UK. "Head lice can be removed by applying plenty of any type of hair conditioner to dry hair and then combing to remove live lice and eggs.Patel explains that the conditioner makes it hard for the lice to move and traps them in the teeth of the comb.“It also detangles hair, making combing easier," he adds.READ MORE: Pink dyes eight-year-old's daughter's hair, hits out at 'parenting police'The NHS advice says this method should be tried first.It should take approximately 10 minutes to comb short hair, and 20 to 30 minutes for long, frizzy or curly hair.The site advises to continue wet combing on days 1, 5, 9 and 13 to catch any newly hatched head lice before checking again that everyone's hair is free of lice on day 17.If you’ve tried wet combing for 17 days and your child is still not nit-free, the NHS says you should ask a pharmacist for advice.“They may recommend using medicated lotions and sprays,” the site explains.“These kill head lice in all types of hair, and you can buy them from pharmacies, supermarkets or online.”But in recent years there has been concerns that head lice could be becoming immune to certain treatments.Back in 2016, a US study revealed that 98 per cent of head lice have developed a resistance to pyrethrins and permethrins - the active ingredients in most remedies available in pharmacies.Last year, parents were warned there could be a big rise in head lice outbreaks in schools over the winter period.A change in NHS England guidance means GPs are now routinely prevented from prescribing treatment for the parasites, causing the health charity Community Hygiene Concern to predict that low-income families could be hit hardest.AdvertisementTRENDINGSunstarMCWD, Visayan Electric operations now normalSunstar·1 min readSunstarPolice nab ‘drug pusher’ on 2nd attemptSunstar·1 min readSunstar60 more modern jeeps expected to operate in Metro Cebu in JanuarySunstar·1 min readSunstarMan shot dead by ‘kumpare’ over jealousySunstar·1 min readSunstarAteneo de Cebu’s Rommel Rasmo: ‘Bawal ang violence sa Cesafi’Sunstar·2 min readAdvertisementAdvertisementOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Evidence:"»Are the claims valid?Tosh is a bit skeptical of the meta-analysis.He said zinc has been studied as a remedy for colds for a long time, and the results are varied.He also noted that the high doses of zinc might be effective in the short run, but he would be concerned about some of the long-term toxicity.He told Healthline that rest and hydration are still the main remedies for a cold.“Taking zinc shouldn’t be done in lieu of taking care of yourself,” he said.Hawkins agreed that one analysis isn’t enough to formulate concrete conclusions.“This is a compelling study and it warrants further study,” she told Healthline. “However, one study is one study.”She also noted that there are different strains of cold viruses that make the ailment tough to treat.“There really isn’t one good medicine for them,” she said.Hawkins did say she would recommend people with a cold consider trying zinc lozenges as long as they didn’t have any side effects or mind the sometimes metallic taste.She said zinc is known to have antiviral effects similar to the anti-bacterial effects of silver.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, thinks along the same lines.He noted the inconsistency of past studies, but also observed that zinc seems to produce few side effects.He said it appears if a person with a cold takes a high enough dose of zinc, they will “get better a little faster.”He cautioned that the lozenges are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so the effectiveness may vary.He also told Healthline there needs to be more study on what the proper dosage should be, how often the lozenges should be taken, and if they should be administered before cold symptoms appear or afterward.“Common colds are a vexing problem,” he noted.Because of that, he said further research is a worthy endeavor.“It would be nice if we had a safe, reliable, inexpensive remedy,” he said.Read more: The weirdest cold treatments from around the world »How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Share this articleBy David Mills —  Updated on June 4, 2017Read this nextWhat Is Chelated Zinc and What Does It Do?Medically reviewed by Natalie Butler, R.D., L.D.Chelated zinc is a zinc supplement that's more easily absorbed by your body for vital health support.

Evidence:"There should technically never be any placebo subject finding themselves cured of the ailment in question, and yet this happens — and often! So, the final theory for copper bracelets advanced by some proponents is that the belief that the wearer holds about the bracelet is where the true power lies. When looking at the many theories surrounding the use of copper bracelets for arthritis, one thing seems to be clear: while the science does not definitively support a link between copper bracelets and reduced pain, many users of copper bracelets report significant pain reduction through their use. It seems that there is widespread hype and genuine support by individuals who have chosen to ignore the nay-sayers and try the bracelets for themselves, many of whom have found exactly what it is they were looking for — mild to strong relief from joint pain. As a result, copper bracelets remain a recommended form of self-healing by holistic healers, reiki practitioners and botanical pharmacists around the world. Their popularity is significant even in eastern cultures, with copper bracelets being sold from the souks of Morocco all the way to the street markets of Indonesia."
