And then we reply, “none of them”, because braces don’t really help for Achilles tendonitis. This article explains why braces aren’t very useful and suggests another simple thing you can do to help alleviate your Achilles pain. Remember, if you need more help with an Achilles injury, you're welcome to consult one of our team via video call. The terms tendinitis, tendonitis, tendinosis, and tendinopathy mean the same thing for all practical purposes, and we use these interchangeably in our articles.In this article:Achilles tendon anatomy Why a brace for Achilles tendonitis is not useful What you can use instead of a brace for Achilles tendon pain How we can help We've also made a video about this:Achilles tendon anatomyTo understand the effect, or lack thereof, of a brace for Achilles tendonitis, it helps to have a quick overview of the anatomy of the Achilles tendon.As you can see in the picture above, the calf muscles come down the back of the ankle, and the Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel bone.The two foot movements that affect your Achilles tendon are dorsiflexion, when your foot moves upwards, towards your shin, such as when you’re squatting, and plantar flexion, when your foot moves downwards, such as when you go up onto your toes.
 If left untreated, a damaged Achilles tendon can lead to pain and loss of flexibility. An Achilles tendon brace can go a long way to ensuring a fast and effective recovery. They are designed to support, stabilise and compress the Achilles tendon, which helps to ease pain while protecting the ankle from further injury. We tested a variety of braces to find the Top 5 Ankle Supports for Achilles Tendonitis, and ranked them here to save you time on research.What Will This Guide Cover?This article will showcase our top ankle braces for Achilles tendonitis, to help you recover with confidence so that you can start moving again. This support applies pulsating compression to your ankle with every step, reducing swelling and discomfort.

Evidence:"Folate has been found to protect against some cancers, prevent heart disorders and stroke, build muscle mass, form hemoglobin, and reduce the impact of mental and emotional disorders, says Improve Memory. Perhaps most interestingly, folic acid is also thought to slow down age-related memory and cognitive decline.Folate (vitamin B-9) is vital for red blood cell formation as well as for healthy cell function and growth, points out the Mayo Clinic. You can get folic acid through a multivitamin or by eating dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans, and peas, as well as fruits such as lemons, oranges, bananas, strawberries, and melons. While studies are still being done, preliminary research suggests that dementia and Alzheimer’s disease could be linked to low folate levels and high homocysteine levels.Low folate and high homocysteine concentrations have been associated with poor cognitive performance. One study showed high doses of folic acid administered to healthy people between 50 and 75 resulted in memory test scores similar to those five years younger, with cognitive speed scores similar to those two years younger. Researchers say this represents a significant level of brain protection due in part to the presence of folate.Facts About FolateFolic acid, a B vitamin used by the body to manufacture DNA, is necessary for rapid cell division and organ and tissue formation in developing babies.The recommended daily intake of folate for adults is 400 micrograms.Folic acid-rich foods include fortified breakfast cereals, bread, rice, pasta, orange juice; green vegetables, and legumes such as kidney, navy, lentil and garbanzo beans.Folic acid intake is thought to lower risks related to stroke, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer.Folate-deficiency anemia, the lack of folic acid in the blood, results in low levels of folate.
 2002 Jun 22; 324(7352): 1512–1515. doi: 10.1136/bmj.324.7352.1512PMCID: PMC1123448PMID: 12077044Folic acid, ageing, depression, and dementiaE H Reynolds, consultant neurologistAuthor information Copyright and License information DisclaimerInstitute of Epileptology, King's College, London SE5 9PJmoc.ten-u.selkcub@sdlonyerCopyright  © 2002, BMJIt is becoming clear that folic acid affects mood and cognitive function, especially in older people. Edward Reynolds draws together the evidenceFolic acid is important for functioning of the nervous system at all ages.1–4 In the fetus the relation between maternal folate status and the risk of neural tube defects is well established: clinical trials have shown that periconceptual preventive treatment with 400 μg or higher of folic acid significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism are associated with a variety of overlapping syndromes which are influenced by age of clinical presentation. These include developmental delay, cognitive deterioration, motor and gait abnormalities, behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, seizures, signs of demyelination or failure of myelination, and vascular changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging or postmortem examination.4 Less commonly, subacute combined degeneration and peripheral neuropathy may also occur.In adult patients presenting with megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, approximately two thirds have neuropsychiatric disorders which overlap considerably with those associated with anaemia due to vitamin B-12 deficiency.2,5 However, depression is commoner in patients with folate deficiency, and subacute combined degeneration with peripheral neuropathy is more frequent in those with vitamin B-12 deficiency. The degree of anaemia is poorly correlated with the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders, but if these anaemias were left untreated nearly all patients would eventually develop neuropsychiatric complications.2 Over the past 35 years numerous studies have shown a high incidence of folate deficiency correlated with mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline in epileptic, neurological, psychiatric, geriatric, and psychogeriatric populations.3,4 Furthermore, recent studies in elderly people suggest a link between folic acid, homocysteine, ageing, depression, and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease.4,6–9In this paper I review the evidence relating folate deficiency to depression and dementia, especially in the ageing nervous system. Summary pointsFolate deficiency is associated with depression and dementiaIn elderly people it may be related to ageing, poor diet, malabsorption, drugs, or increased demand or be unexplainedFolic acid has particular effects on mood and cognitive and social functionImpaired folate metabolism may result in a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that resembles ageingThe duration of folate deficiency and of its treatment is as important as the degree of deficiency and the dose of folic acidFolic acid should be used with caution in the presence of vitamin B-12 deficiency or epilepsyFolic acid is important in the nervous system at all ages, but in elderly people deficiency contributes to ageing brain processes, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and, if critically severe, can lead to a reversible dementiaPatients with epilepsyMany studies of folate in serum, red cells, or cerebrospinal fluid have shown a consistent association between drug induced deficiency and mental changes, especially depression, apathy, psychomotor retardation and dementia.3,4Treatment of 26 folate deficient epileptic patients with 5 mg of folic acid daily for one to three years resulted in improved drive, initiative, alertness, concentration, mood, and sociability in most.1 This contradicted the prevailing view that folic acid was harmful only to the nervous system, although that concept was reinforced by the additional observation that seizure control deteriorated in several of the patients.
 Neuropsychological tests were administered, and folate, homocysteine, vitamin B12, IL-6, TNF-α, Aβ-42, and Aβ-40 were measured at baseline and at 6- and 12-month time points.152 participants (folic acid: 77, conventional: 75) completed the trial. Significant improvements in folate (ηp2 = 0.703, P = 0.011), homocysteine (ηp2 = 0.644, P = 0.009), Aβ-42 (ηp2 = 0.687, P = 0.013), peripheral IL-6 (ηp2 = 0.477, P = 0.025), TNF-α (ηp2 = 0.709, P = 0.009) levels were observed in folic acid group compared with conventional group. Folic acid supplementation improved the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (P = 0.028; effect size d = 0.153), Information (P = 0.031; d = 0.157) and Digit Span (P = 0.009; d = 0.172) scores at 12 months compared with conventional treatment. Based on these findings, daily oral administration of a 400-μg folic acid supplement to MCI subjects for 12 months can significantly improve cognitive performance and reduce peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels. IntroductionCurrently, dementia is a substantial public health concern due to the exponentially increasing number of older adults. Developing novel strategies to protect cognition in the elderly population is critical for managing the disease burden and cost of care1."

Evidence:"If it works, duct tape occlusion therapy could offer a less painful, cheaper, easier alternative to traditional wart removal methods like cryotherapy and salicylic acid. But does it work?
 There is older and newer research that seems to demonstrate that duct tape works better for wart treatment than other methods, such as freezing.One 2003 study claims that duct tape is 80 percent effective for speeding up the rate at which warts go away.More clinical research is needed to discover if, and why, duct tape works to get rid of warts. What to know before you use this methodAvoid using duct tape on a wart that is:near your genitalsunder your armpitsclose to one of your mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Plantar warts, which occur on your heels or other parts of your feet, may be more resistant to these treatments because the layers of skin on your feet tend to be more difficult to remove. If you have genital warts, visit a doctor. Human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes topical and genital warts, can be transmitted sexually. Certain strains of HPV are associated with a greater risk of cervical cancer.Since genital warts are transmitted sexually, get tested to see which strain of HPV you have before you try any home treatments for your warts. Duct tape can cause redness, bleeding, rashes, and pain upon removal.
 Therefore, it can take a while for warts to resolve on their own.Duct tape wart removal may help people get rid of warts more quickly, but this method requires frequent and repeated applications of duct tape, which can be difficult to keep up.For this reason, some people might prefer other home remedies or medical treatment options.In this article, we explain how to perform duct tape wart removal. We also discuss other ways to remove warts.Does it work?Share on PinterestPeople must use repeated applications of duct tape to remove a wart with this method.Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work for several reasons. One theory is that the tape deprives the skin cells of oxygen. By “suffocating” the wart, the duct tape makes it more likely that the skin cells will die.The process of applying and removing the duct tape may also remove additional skin cells, which can make the wart less bulky and noticeable.However, there is a lack of recent research into using duct tape as a wart removal treatment, and earlier studies have produced mixed results.One 2002 study found that the duct tape method was significantly more effective than cryotherapy, which involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The study included 51 participants ages 3–22.They received either up to six sessions of cryotherapy, which took place every 2–3 weeks, or 2 months of duct tape application. Warts resolved entirely in 85% of the participants in the duct tape group and in 60% of those in the cryotherapy group.However, a 2007 study into using adhesive pads to treat warts found that adding duct tape to a breathable fabric called moleskin made no difference to its effectiveness."

When to get medical attention
Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.More serious burns require professional medical attention.You should go to a hospital A&E department for:all chemical and electrical burnslarge or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's handburns that cause white or charred skin – any sizeburns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitalsIf someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention.Some symptoms may be delayed and can include:coughinga sore throatdifficulty breathingfacial burnsPeople at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald.The size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended.Read more about:recovering from burns and scaldscomplications of burns and scalds
Types of burn
Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected.Your skin has 3 layers:the epidermis – the outer layer of skinthe dermis – the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair folliclesthe subcutaneous fat, or subcutis – the deeper layer of fat and tissueThere are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:superficial epidermal burn – where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blisteredsuperficial dermal burn – where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blistersdeep dermal or partial thickness burn – where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painlessfull thickness burn – where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy.

Evidence:"In this whole process, folic acid works in tandem with vitamin B12 as a methyl group donor. This is why it is always recommended to take these two vitamins together in order to treat vitiligo. According to some scientific studies, a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation and sun exposure is a good strategy to regain natural skin color. Supplementation of B12 and folic acid along with pantothenic acid, a water soluble form of B vitamins, has also shown very promising outcome in removing white patches. Vitamin A, C, and E
These vitamins act as antioxidants and prevent epidermal oxidative stress, which is considered as a causative factor for premature destruction of melanocytes. Vitamin D

        Abstract
      The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter.
 Vitamin D is probably the most common, because many of us are deficient in this vitamin, and vitiligo patients may be more so because of their need to avoid the sun to prevent burning of their sensitive white spots. But this doesn’t mean that their low vitamin D caused, or is even affecting, their vitiligo, and supplementing their vitamin D may be a good idea for their overall health, but is unlikely to help their vitiligo. Some have heard that vitiligo is partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in melanocytes, you can read more about that here. So some believe that taking antioxidants should help the disease, and many dermatologists recommend this for their patients. However it is important to remember that no matter how much things seem to make sense, we can’t know for sure if this approach will help vitiligo until they’re tested in clinical trials. Another example is supplementing vitamin B12 – this vitamin is more commonly deficient in vitiligo patients compared to the general population."

Evidence:"A review of 15 studies published in April 2016 in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews looked at the effect of yoga in patients with asthma, finding that yoga “probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.”“There can be outside forces, such as allergens and toxins, that may trigger an asthma attack,” says Bar. “While we can’t always necessarily avoid some triggers, we can use yoga to try to generally stay calm and have breath and body awareness, and that may be able to at least take a layer off the severity of the attack, if not help prevent it.”Doing yoga routinely can have a cumulative effect, says Bar. If you begin to feel an asthma attack coming on, you can use breath awareness, says Bar, to slow down and remain calm. During an asthma attack, Bar adds, we use any muscles we can to try to breathe, and as a result, our muscles get very tight; stretching the shoulders, back, side, and breathing muscles routinely is great conditioning for getting those muscles in the habit of relaxing in the event of an asthma attack. “You can do a relaxation pose every day and do one or two of the body stretches daily,” says Bar. “It won’t take very long.” And best of all, there are secondary benefits of yoga, such as a feeling of peace, increased mobility, better flexibility, and improved balance, says Bar.Simply put, yoga may help provide some asthma relief, and can lead to a host of other health benefits.
 Hath yoga is a physical method which uses the breath to link the various parts of the body and the mind and to allow them to behave as one functional unit which helps in the control of Asthma (9–11).Different studies have revealed that yoga has significant importance in improving symptoms of asthmatics and in hypertension (12–18). It was found that one preliminary study of yoga therapy for asthma on 46 patients data clearly shows a significant qualitative improvement in the severity and duration of attacks; attacks per week and decrease medication use (19).Significant symptomatic improvement after yoga training for 9 months in patients with chronic severe airways obstruction was observed in Australia. A decade ago both short and long-term prospective studies in India showed clearly the beneficial effects of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma (20). A study showed significant effect with in short time (13 days) of yoga practice (21).Since bronchial asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in resource limited areas where the long term use of multiple drugs is costly, it is wise to think alternative way to treat such an illness with better economic safety and avoid adverse effect of the drugs. The study therefore tries to look into the applicability of yoga as an alternative approach in the treatment of asthma in Ethiopia. The research so conducted aimed at determining the clinical features, peak expiratory flow rate and use of drugs for their asthma in asthmatic patients before and after the yoga practice.Patients and MethodsThe study was conducted at the missionary of charity in Jimma town, southwest Ethiopia from March 28 to April 27, 2009 GC.
 Larger reviews and studies are needed to understand how yoga can help asthma, if at all.But if you’ve been properly managing your asthma, it doesn’t hurt to try it. Many people with asthma report feeling better by doing yoga. It’s said that yoga may help by improving posture and opening the chest muscles, which encourages better breathing. It could also teach you to control breathing and reduce stress, a common trigger of asthma symptoms. Yoga exercises to tryWhen trying these yoga techniques, keep your rescue inhaler nearby. Move gently and slowly.If you’re new to yoga, check with your doctor first."

Evidence:": Feed a Cold, Starve a FeverThe answer is simmering in a bowl of chicken soupBy Mark Fischetti on January 3, 2014Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditShare on LinkedInShare via EmailPrint Credit: Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Maxims typically date back many years, but “feed a cold, starve a fever” may beat them all. This saying has been traced to a 1574 dictionary by John Withals, which noted that “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief is that eating food may help the body generate warmth during a “cold” and that avoiding food may help it cool down when overheated. But recent medical science says the old saw is wrong. It should be “feed a cold, feed a fever.”
Let’s take colds first.
 If anything, the adage should be, “feed a cold, feed a fever,” because bodies fighting illness need energy, so eating healthy food helps. Eating food when you have a cold can also help the body generate heat, although other methods of keeping warm, like wearing an extra layer of clothes or wrapping yourself in a blanket, do the trick as well. There are many reasons you shouldn’t try to starve a fever. Fever is part of the immune system’s attempt to combat the virus. Fever raises body temperature, which increases metabolism and burns more calories. That’s one reason why taking in calories becomes important.

Evidence:"In studies on the relationship between selenium and cancer prevention, data suggest it may help prevent gastrointestinal (16) (36) and lung (17) cancers, although findings from bladder cancer research are conflicting (26) (38) (44). Other studies on whether selenium status impacts cancer risk are also mixed (51) (52) (53), and a review of RCTs did not find clear evidence of cancer preventive potential (29). In addition, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) failed to find protective effects against prostate cancer (8) (21) or colorectal adenomas (45). In other studies, selenium along with soy and vitamin E did not prevent prostate cancer progression (27), and selenium taken with lycopene did not modulate prostate cancer risk (46). Moreover, selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer (22), and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality (37). A chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with non-small cell lung cancer did not show benefit, but did suggest a possible nonsignificant increase in secondary lung cancers (25).
 More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.Study characteristics
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.Key results
All of the high‐quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome ‐ prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high‐grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose‐response relation.

Evidence:"Practice Pointers
Oral contraceptives have long been known to be highly effective at suppressing the development of ovarian cysts. In one study, the relative risk of developing ovarian cysts was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.39) for women taking an oral contraceptive compared with those not taking an oral contraceptive.1 Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts, the authors sought to clarify whether this is appropriate. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Although the studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analyses for most questions, results from these studies were consistent enough to draw several conclusions. Five trials looked at spontaneously occurring ovarian cysts, representing a combined total of 398 women. The largest study included 141 women, and four of the studies were conducted in Turkey.
 Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. Objectives:
      This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. Search methods:
      In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also examined the reference lists of articles. For the initial review, we wrote to authors of identified trials to seek articles we had missed.
 The following article will cover the relationship between ovarian cysts and hormonal birth control. How can birth control prevent ovarian cysts from forming? Taking hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD, can be an effective method in preventing ovarian cysts from forming. Combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progesterone, are the most effective at blocking ovulation. The mini-pill, which contains only progestin, has an unpredictable effect on ovulation and is, therefore, less effective at preventing cysts from forming. Individuals who skip their periods while on birth control further decrease their likelihood of developing cysts."

Evidence:"However, a review on zinc supplementation trials during pregnancy did not report a significant effect of zinc supplementation on neonatal survival. [29]
Zinc deficiency can interfere with many metabolic processes when it occurs during infancy and childhood, a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high. [30] Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning. [31] In some studies, supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low birth weight infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers. [31]
Testosterone production[edit]
Zinc is required to produce testosterone. Thus, zinc deficiency can lead to reduced circulating testosterone, which could lead to sexual immaturity (Ananda Parsad, et al.)

 There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits. Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations in impoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrient and or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be an urgent priority.Plain language summaryZinc supplementation for improving pregnancy and infant outcomeTaking zinc during pregnancy helps to slightly reduce preterm births, but does not prevent other problems such as low birthweight babies.Many women of childbearing age may have mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc concentrations may cause preterm birth or they may even prolong labour. It is also possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well. This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, involving over 17,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementation has a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does not help to prevent low birthweight babies compared with not giving zinc supplements before 27 weeks of pregnancy. One trial did not contribute data."

Evidence:"There are some reports that evening primrose oil can interact with blood thinner medication. Some people also report nausea and an upset stomach after taking evening primrose oil. While taking evening primrose oil for eczema may not hurt, it most likely will not help. “There is some suggestion that topically applied [evening primrose oil] may have some beneficial effect on eczema, but the evidence was not very robust,” said Dr. Lio. “This suggests that it may only work on a subset of patients and/or the actual clinical effect may be very minimal.”
Instead, Dr. Lio recommends looking into other supplements that are more effective in treating eczema symptoms, such as hemp seed oil. In one study, participants who took hempseed as an oral supplement showed improvement in their atopic dermatitis symptoms.
 If you’ve ever dealt with eczema, you know how uncomfortable it can be. The most common course of treatment is easing symptoms, often with herbal supplements, such as evening primrose oil. Evening primrose oil is also a treatment for psoriasis and acne. It’s been linked to treatment for arthritis, osteoporosis, breast pain, diabetic neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. The United Kingdom once approved evening primrose oil for eczema and breast pain treatment, but they revoked the license in 2002 due to insufficient evidence that it works. Today, there’s conflicting evidence that it is effective for treating eczema.The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine lists it as ineffective for treating eczema when taken orally, and a 2013 study found it to be no more effective than placebo pills.

Evidence:"Slowly rebuild after an ankle fracture
If the ankle is broken, the joint shouldn’t bear any weight or strain for at least 6 weeks so the fracture can heal. As a result, the stabilising muscles weaken and are much less effective when it comes to rehab. Proper movement and exercise with a therapist in these 6 weeks is crucial to the long term recovery of the cartilage and ligaments. Using supports and ankle braces in the rehab and recovery period is the best practice for long-term health of the joint. Supports and orthoses provide stability and stimulation
A brace provides support after the initial 6 week rest period.It ensures that the ankle joint receives the necessary stability after a fracture and is not overloaded. These products are designed and shaped so that they can be worn comfortably day to day, in most footwear including joggers, sports shoes and business shoes.
 Studies examining both operatively and nonoperatively treated ankle fractures were included. There is minimal evidence supporting the use of functional bracing over cast immobilization to improve functional outcome, range of motion, swelling, or post-traumatic arthrosis after ankle fracture in the long term. The primary benefits of functional bracing are the potential to return to work earlier and bracing may facilitate activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing. In addition, there may be a decreased patient risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization. However, there is an increased risk of wound infection when using a brace after open reduction and internal fixation of an unstable ankle fracture. Functional bracing can be used for treating stable and postoperative ankle fractures in compliant patients to potentially expedite and facilitate the recovery process.
 Benefits Of An Ankle Brace
In general, an ankle brace keeps your foot and toes pointed forward and prevents inward rotation or twisting of the foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains (stretching and tearing of ligaments, tendons, and other soft tissue) occur with sudden twisting or rotation of the ankle joint as you step off a curb or stair, or run on a bumpy, uneven surface. When an ankle injury occurs, coaches, primary care physicians, orthopaedic specialists, and podiatrists often advise patients to wear ankle braces for joint support and to prevent further injury. Bracing also limits the development of scar tissue and arthritis and reduces both acute and chronic pain. An ankle brace is an adjunctive tool after casting, surgery, physical therapy, exercise, targeted training, and other kinds of medical interventions. Your podiatrist in South Texas may advise an ankle brace in these situations:
Ankle fracture
Hindfoot fracture
Ankle sprain and repeated ankle sprains
Ankle instability due to arthritis, sprains, and obesity
Poor balance
Dysfunctional gait, such as toeing in or repeated inward rotation of the ankle joint
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis
Gout
Achilles tendonitis
Avoiding or postponing ankle fusion or replacement surgery due to advanced arthritis

Evidence:"In total, 90% reported either an allergic reaction or that the vitamin did not affect their scarring.However, the vitamin may benefit other skin conditions. For example, one 2015 study suggested that vitamin E may improve symptoms and quality of life for people with atopic dermatitis, or eczema.A 2016 review says that more research is required to investigate whether there is any value in using vitamin E to manage scar healing. At present, there is not enough evidence to recommend using vitamin E to diminish scars.Learn about which home remedies might help treat scars.Using vitamin E for scarsBased on the available evidence, it would seem that vitamin E does not reduce the appearance of scarring.However, moisturizing the skin can help prevent scars from forming during wound healing, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). As long as a person is not allergic to vitamin E, they can use a moisturizer that contains this ingredient. However, it is unclear if moisturizers containing vitamin E would offer special benefits.Anyone interested in using topical vitamin E oil or taking vitamin E supplements should speak to a healthcare provider before trying.Learn more about vitamin E oil here.Effective techniques for scar healingThere are other ways to reduce the appearance of scars that may be more effective than vitamin E. These include:Silicone sheetsHydrogel or silicone gel sheets are soft, flexible, self-adhesive dressings that a person can apply over scars to flatten and soften them.Silicone may hydrate the scar tissue and reduce the production of collagen fibers. This means that scars may develop flatter, softer, and paler than they would otherwise.The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom suggest using silicone sheets for 12 hours a day for at least 3 months.Learn more about scar tissue here.MassageScar massage is one of the most common treatments for scar management.
 Ointments and creams that contain vitamin E claim to clear every type of scar can be found on store shelves across America.However, evidence that vitamin E has this effect is mostly anecdotal. There’s little clinical evidence to support any of these claims.Find out the truth about the many health claims for caprylic acid. Healing scarsOne study found that vitamin E and Aquaphor ointments were no different in healing 90 percent of scars in people who had recently had patches of skin cancer removed. And one-third of the participants who used vitamin E developed a red, itchy rash called contact dermatitis.However, a different study found that children with surgical scars who used vitamin E three times a day didn’t develop keloids, or extra scar tissue over the wound. Researchers concluded that using a topical form of vitamin E before and after surgery improved the way wounds healed.Research on how vitamin E can treat acne and heal its scars is inconclusive. There’s little proof that vitamin E oil can help heal scars.
 One of the most popular is vitamin E, which is found in many skin creams. But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. "People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not," Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it "a proven scientific fact" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also "nonsense", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. "People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars," Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen."

Evidence:"Natoli JL, Manack A, Dean B, Butler Q, Turkel CC, Stovner L, et al. Global prevalence of chronic migraine: a systematic review. Cephalalgia. 2010;30(5):599–609.
 Supplementation was associated with significant decrease in migraine attack frequency and severity, as well as decreased P1 amplitude on VEPs, and increased cortical blood flow to the inferolateral temporal, inferofrontal and insular regions seen on SPECT. The authors suggested that magnesium may interfere with both neurogenic and vascular mechanisms of migraine and may hence be an effective prophylactic treatment. Other studies using SPECT have shown conflicting results (Ramadan et al., 1991; Ferrari et al., 1995; Olesen et al., 1982).Women with menstrually-related migraine (MRM) may be particularly prone to developing magnesium deficiency. A prospective study involving 270 women, 61 of whom had MRM, showed that 45% had ionized magnesium deficiency during MRM attacks, 15% during non- menstrual attacks, 14% during menstruation without migraine and 15% between menstruation without migraine (Mauskop et al., 2002). Serum ionized calcium/magnesium levels were elevated in MRM, with normal ionized calcium levels.Magnesium deficiency has also been found in paediatric migraine, with decreased levels of serum, RBC and mononuclear blood cell magnesium found in paediatric migraineurs with or without aura compared with patients with tension type headache and controls (Soriani et al., 1995; Mazzotta et al., 1999). Magnesium supplementation may be a safe and well- tolerated option for migraine prophylaxis in the prevention of paediatric migraine.
 If you have migraines, should you take magnesium supplements? You may have heard or read that high doses of magnesium can help prevent this extremely painful form of chronic headache. While scientists aren’t certain whether magnesium supplements stifle migraines, there’s enough evidence from studies to suggest that this simple, inexpensive treatment might be worth a try.What Is Magnesium?Magnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in your body. Much of it goes toward helping to build bones and muscle, but you also need magnesium to produce energy, control blood pressure, and perform many other critical roles.What’s the Link Between Magnesium and Migraines?Studies have found that people who have migraines tend to have lower levels of magnesium than people who don’t get headaches. Some scientists believe that magnesium blocks signals in the brain that lead to migraines with an aura, or changes in vision and other senses. Research also suggests that magnesium stops certain chemicals that cause pain."

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun. When it’s possible, go outside with a friend, connect, and enjoy the weather.
 Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:
Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes. Resistance training and aerobic exercise both helped to lower insulin resistance in previously sedentary older adults with abdominal obesity at risk for diabetes.
 According to the American Diabetes Association, adults with type 2 diabetes should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. Ideally, weekly exercise would be spread over at least three days, with no more than two days passing without some form of activity. For those engaging in high-intensity exercise, shorter durations of 75 minutes per week may be sufficient.RELATED: What Updated Exercise Guidelines Mean for People With DiabetesAnd importantly, weekly workouts should include resistance, or strength, training at least two or three days, preferably on nonconsecutive days. Research shows that performing both aerobic (also known as cardiovascular) exercise and strength training is far more beneficial at improving insulin health than either type of exercise alone, explains Nick Occhipinti, CSCS, an exercise physiologist based in Red Bank, New Jersey.How Exercise Improves Insulin HealthExercise helps manage prediabetes and type 2 diabetes by lowering blood glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity throughout the body. Here’s how:Taking Up Excess Glucose An immediate benefit of exercise is lowering excessively high blood sugar levels, Dr. Kazlauskaite says. Exercise triggers the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the working muscles and organs."

Fermented milk for hypertension 
High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure. Authors' conclusions: 
The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure.
 Certain yoghurt and milk products could reduce high blood pressure, a study has suggested (Image: Getty Image)  Eating fermented milk products such as yoghurt could reduce high blood pressure (Image: Getty Images)According to researchers there is growing evidence to suggest that gut bacteria, or microbiota, might have an effect on the development of high blood pressure. Tailor-made milk could be designed to target people with hypertension. The study also looked at ways of managing the gut through these specially designed milks.The idea is these milks would be stocked in supermarkets alongside the growing number of alternative health products.

"Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milks with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects.

 Together with the UK and Ireland, 
Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
"does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects"​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood 
pressure in animals, and to lower blood pressure in people with 
mild hypertension."

VO: DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:
to treat people aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.
 When topical prescriptions aren’t enough, and your symptoms and flare-ups keep coming back, it may be time for a different kind of treatment. DUPIXENT helps you stay ahead of symptoms—continuously treating eczema between flare-ups. See how it works
DUPIXENT is a biologic that helps block a key source of inflammation inside the body that can cause eczema. DUPIXENT is not a steroid or immunosuppressant; it is a prescription biologic medicine given under the skin (subcutaneous injection). A BREAKTHROUGH ECZEMA TREATMENT
DUPIXENT was studied in adults and children 6 months of age and older. See the clinical results by choosing adults (18+ years), teens (12-17 years), children (6-11 years), or young children (6 months-5 years).

Evidence:"Improve physical function
People with arthritis who practice yoga regularly will eventually see improved physical function. “Yoga can enhance pain management, thereby improving function,” Dr. Kolasinski says. Improve flexibility
Yoga can also benefit people with stiff joints due to arthritis. Stretching exercises in general help improve range of motion, so the fact that you’re stretching in yoga will help flexibility. Stay active
On days when you’re experiencing a painful arthritis flare, continuing to do some type of physical activity like yoga, if possible, can help you maintain joint flexibility. Create a mind-body connection
Yoga’s emphasis on introspective thought – pinpointing the sources of pain or anxiety and learning to relax them – is useful for people with arthritis.
 In our study we provided critical evidence showing that in people with arthritis who are sedentary, yoga appears to be safe, feasible, and enjoyable for people with both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and that it results in important physical and mental health benefits for people who practice it regularly. Importantly, almost all benefits that we saw in patients after they completed an 8-week program were still evident 9 months later including walking speed and physical function. Improvements in positive affect, perceived stress, and pain were also noted. Our same yoga program was used in a follow up study which also found improvements in balance, functional reach, upper body function, and pain after completing the intervention.35  Participants from this clinical trial communicate back to us that they continue to practice yoga, now almost a decade later. Participants in this study practiced specially designed classes that used an Integral Yoga approach. They came to classes twice a week for 8 weeks to practice under the close supervision of a yoga therapist.
 But any healthy balanced diet should still be balanced with a regular exercise regimen.Online yoga for knee arthritisEarlier research supports the use of yoga for knee osteoarthritis, showing that it may improve pain, physical function, and joint stiffness. However, none of these prior studies looked specifically at online yoga programs for people with this condition, until now.The new study involved 212 people with knee osteoarthritis. All participants had access to online information about osteoarthritis, treatment options, and the benefits of physical activity, weight loss, and healthy sleep habits.Researchers randomly assigned around half of the people to do a 12-week self-paced online yoga program.The program consisted of a series of 12 pre-recorded 30-minute videos. People were asked to do one video a week, three times during the week.The classes included a slow-paced mix of static and dynamic yoga poses designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles of the core and legs. Instructors also offered different modifications and levels of the poses, so people could adapt the program to suit their personal needs and abilities.However, the classes focused on physical postures but didn’t include other aspects of yoga, such as deep relaxation, chanting, and meditation, which could also help reduce pain.Physical function improved with yogaAfter 12 weeks, subjects who did the yoga classes saw greater improvements on average in their physical function, knee stiffness, and quality of life, compared to those who only had access to online osteoarthritis education.Still, there was only a small difference between the two groups in the level of knee pain while walking at 12 weeks.After the program ended, researchers followed up with participants another 12 weeks later. By then, both groups had similar levels of physical function, pain, knee stiffness, and quality of life.This loss of benefits seen in the yoga group may be because many people stopped doing the yoga classes after the 12-week program ended.During the last week of the course, over two-thirds of participants completed at least two classes a week."

 Acute treatment of cluster headache episodes can be relieved by administering sumatriptan subcutaneously. [1] According to clinical studies, sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for migraines when given intranasally, subcutaneously, or orally. It relieves photophobia, nausea, headache, and functional disability. Non-FDA-approved indications of sumatriptan include the treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. [2]Mechanism of ActionSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) has a central role in the pathophysiology of a migraine. Its metabolism is abnormal in patients with migraines, and intravenous administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine can alleviate migraine attacks."

Here are some questions to think about when buying a light box for seasonal affective disorder:
Is it made specifically to treat SAD? If not, it may not help your depression. Some light therapy lamps are designed for skin disorders — not for SAD. Lamps used for skin disorders mainly produce ultraviolet (UV) light and could damage your eyes if used incorrectly.
 Usually, these can be dealt with by adjusting the duration, intensity, or timing of the sessions.Side effects may include:headacheseyestrainagitation irritabilityproblems with sleepingfatigueblurry visionYou can discuss these side effects with a doctor, but you may also find relief through some simple changes. Avoid using the lamp before bedtime to prevent insomnia, and place the light box further away from you to prevent eyestrain and headaches. Pros of light therapyIn addition to the possible benefits for improving depression symptoms, light therapy is generally easy to start and adjust according to how it makes you feel.Light therapy is:Accessible. The treatment can be done at home using rented or purchased light boxes.Noninvasive. It provides an alternative or add-on to medical interventions like medications, but is not taken internally.Safe.

Naproxen for acute migraine in adults 
Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people the main feature is a painful headache. Other symptoms include feeling sick, vomiting, disturbed vision, and sensitivity to light, sound, and smells.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat migraine headaches. On 22 May 2013, we looked for clinical trials where naproxen was used to treat migraine headache. We found six good quality studies with about 2700 people.Naproxen was more effective than placebo for relieving migraine headache in adults, but only weakly so.

Evidence:"What should you do?The rumor mill might have you believing that dabbing some regular old toothpaste on your zit will help it clear up overnight. But, while it’s true that several ingredients found in toothpaste are drying to skin and might help shrink your pimple, this home remedy for breakouts isn’t worth the risk.Plus, there are several easily available treatments you can try instead. Keep reading to learn why toothpaste doesn’t belong on your skin.Toothpaste on pimples may  do more harm than goodAlthough it’s not clear exactly how and where this trend got started, some likely reasons are:Many toothpaste formulas once contained a chemical called triclosan that could work to kill the bacteria that causes and worsens breakouts.Some ingredients commonly found in toothpaste, such as baking soda, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide, are known to be drying, which could help shrink a zit.According to Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse, a board-certified dermatologist, the menthol in toothpaste can create a tingly feeling that may temporarily reduce pain and swelling.So, it’s not totally out of left field to believe this home remedy could work. But there are several reasons why you shouldn’t use toothpaste as your go-to acne treatment.Outdated informationFirst of all, most companies no longer use triclosan in their toothpaste formulas. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, some testing suggests that triclosan could negatively affect thyroid hormones. So even if you do find a toothpaste that still contains this chemical, using it on pimples may not be worth the risk.Toothpaste can be irritating to your skinRemember, toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not the sensitive surface of your face.

Acne (Pimples)Acne is a localized skin inflammation as a result of overactivity of oil glands at the
base of hair follicles. This inflammation, depending on its location, can take the form
of a superficial pustule (contains pus), a pimple, a deeper cyst, congested pores, whiteheads, or blackheads. Treatments vary depending on the severity of the acne. Acne develops when cells and natural oils begin to block up tiny hair follicles in the skin.

Evidence:"There is strong evidence for NSAID use based on the AAOS guidelines.Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are available as dietary supplements. They are structural components of articular cartilage, and the thought is that a supplement will aid in the health of articular cartilage. No strong evidence exists that these supplements are beneficial in knee OA; in fact, there is strong evidence against the use according to the AAOS guidelines. There are no major downsides to taking the supplement. If the patient understands the evidence behind these supplements and is willing to try the supplement, it is a relatively safe option. Any benefit gained from supplementation is likely due to a placebo effect.Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may be useful for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, especially where there is a considerable inflammatory component.
 The quality of the studies varied and so did the results. However, the largest and best studies (including the NIH study discussed under the heading “Glucosamine” above) showed that chondroitin doesn’t lessen osteoarthritis pain. Joint StructureA few studies have looked at whether glucosamine or chondroitin can have beneficial effects on joint structure. Some but not all studies found evidence that chondroitin might help, but the improvements may be too small to make a difference to patients. There is little evidence that glucosamine has beneficial effects on joint structure. Experts’ Recommendations
Experts disagree on whether glucosamine and chondroitin may help knee and hip osteoarthritis.
 Glucosamine and chondroitin are popular supplements used to treat osteoarthritis (OA). According to one estimate from the National Institutes of Health, 6.5 million adults, or 2.6% of the population, has used one or both of these products. Although studies on glucosamine and chondroitin have been mixed, some evidence suggests they may help relieve OA joint pain and stiffness. What Are Glucosamine and Chondroitin? Glucosamine and chondroitin are natural compounds found in healthy cartilage — the connective tissue that cushions joints. Supplements are manufactured from the cartilage of animals such as cows, pigs or shellfish, or are made in a lab."

Evidence:"The document also focuses specifically on their effects on hypertriglyceridemia, rather than atherosclerotic vascular disease. To TCTMD, Skulas-Ray stressed that the degree of treatment response to omega-3 prescriptions is determined by the severity of an individual’s triglyceride levels prior to treatment. She also noted that levels are highly variable day-to-day, so the determination of response shouldn’t be based on a single triglyceride measurement. For managing hypertriglyceridemia (200-499 mg/dL), the AHA experts state that prescription-strength omega-3 fatty acids, either with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or EPA plus docosapentaenoic acid (DHA), would be expected to yield a 20% to 30% reduction in triglycerides without any increase in LDL cholesterol. For individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia, 4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce triglycerides by more than 30%, but LDL cholesterol may increase in agents that contain DHA. The goal for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce decrease triglycerides to less than 500 mg/dL and decrease the risk of pancreatitis.

Evidence:"Several clinical trials have proposed that modulation of the gut microbiota using probiotics may improve immune responses to infections and influenza vaccination in elderly subjects [97,98].In contrast, all probiotic strains might not improve protection against respiratory virus infections. Some studies in elderly subjects have shown no significant effect of probiotics on respiratory infections [99]. In a RCT conducted in 737 healthy elderly people, daily intake of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (L. casei Shirota) for 176 days did not decrease the occurrence of respiratory symptoms and did not improve the influenza-vaccination immune response in the group receiving probiotic compared to the control group [100]. Similar findings have been reported in other age groups.

Can probiotics (live micro-organisms) prevent upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold? Key messagesProbiotics may be beneficial in preventing at least one occurrence of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and are likely beneficial in preventing at least three occurrences of URTIs. More studies conducted in the elderly are needed. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of probiotics use.What are acute upper respiratory tract infections?Acute URTIs include colds, influenza, and infections of the throat, nose, or sinuses. Symptoms include fever, cough, pain and headaches.
 Clinical trials have shown that probiotics can be used as preventive and therapeutic agents in upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and otitis. Their mechanical properties allow them to aggregate and to compete with pathogens for nutrients, space and attachment to host cells. Consequently, they can directly antagonize pathogens and thus exert beneficial effects without directly affecting the metabolism of the host. An overview of the probiotics with such traits, tested up to date in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of URTIs and otitis, is presented in this review. Their mechanical properties in the respiratory tract as well as at other locations are also cited. Species with interesting in vitro properties towards pharyngeal cells or against common respiratory pathogens have also been included."

Evidence:"By Mary Margaret Chappell and Jennifer Davis
Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City.
 Limited data suggest that aromatherapy massage and reflexology may help to reduce pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of aromatherapy massage and reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study sample was randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy massage (n = 17), reflexology (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17). Aromatherapy massage was applied to both knees of subjects in the first intervention group for 30 minutes. Reflexology was administered to both feet of subjects in the second intervention group for 40 minutes during weekly home visits. Control group subjects received no intervention.
 Participants received a 30-minute massage once a week for 6 weeks.Pain and fatigue scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy massage group compared to a control group that did not receive any intervention.The study authors concluded that the aromatherapy massage could help to manage pain and fatigue in people with RA, although it is unclear whether the massage or essential oils themselves were beneficial.A person can inhale lavender essential oil, or dilute it in a carrier oil to add to a bath.4. GingerGinger has a longstanding reputation for reducing chronic inflammation due to the anti-inflammatory effects of gingerols, which are compounds in the ginger plant. Ginger essential oil may contain other compounds that help to ease the symptoms of RA, too.A 2016 study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of ginger essential oil in rat models of RA. Rats that had received injections of the oil exhibited reduced rates of chronic joint inflammation. However, further studies involving human participants are necessary to confirm the effects.People can try diluting ginger essential oil in a safe amount of carrier oil and applying it to the joints.5. Turmeric essential oilAn older study from 2010 funded in part by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health found that turmeric essential oil reduced joint inflammation in rats."

What Can I Do About Croup? Run a hot shower to create a steam-filled bathroom where you can sit with your child for 20 minutes. Take your child outside during cooler months for a few minutes. This may help breathing. Use a cool-mist humidifier.
 An old home remedy suggests that steam may work. But, will putting your child in the shower or in a steamy bathroom with a hot shower running actually soothe croup cough? Unfortunately, the answer is no — and research does not support this practice either.﻿﻿

 It usually lasts 2–5 days and can often be treated at home. Tips and treatment for croup
Because croup is a virus, antibiotics do not help. Giving your child over-the-counter cold medications will not help either. However, the following tips may help the cough and stridor:

Evidence:"Since there are different types of alopecia, you need to see a medical professional to find out which kind you have. Depending on the reason for your hair loss, they may recommend the medication minoxidil.What Is Minoxidil?Minoxidil is a non-prescription drug that can spur hair growth and keep you from losing more hair, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Minoxidil comes in foam and solution forms. You rub it into your scalp, typically once or twice a day, the academy says.What Types of Alopecia Does Minoxidil Treat?“Minoxidil is the FDA-approved treatment of male- and female-pattern hair loss, known as androgenetic alopecia,” dermatologist Adam Mamelak, MD, tells WebMD Connect to Care. Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of alopecia, according to NYU Langone Health. About 50 million men in the United States have it.Mamelak says minoxidil “is also showing its usefulness” for:Alopecia areata: an autoimmune disease that often causes round or oval bald patches, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Telogen effluvium: hair loss that can be triggered by a variety of things, from childbirth to surgery to severe stress, according to Harvard Medical SchoolChemotherapy-induced hair lossMinoxidil works best if you use it soon after you start losing hair.
 But the drug is not currently FDA-approved to treat hair loss when taken orally — and so any prescription for this purpose is considered “off-label.”4. The Research on Taking Minoxidil Orally for Hair Loss Is LackingSo far, there isn’t enough high-quality research to support oral minoxidil for hair loss. But a handful of small studies suggest that oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss, and may be more effective for some patients than topical treatments, Dr. Sattur says.For example, one small observational study involving 100 women experiencing female pattern hair loss suggested that a daily pill containing 0.25 milligrams (mg) minoxidil and 25 mg spironolactone was safe and effective in treating the condition. But the study did not use a control group, so it’s not clear whether these results are due to the medication.A later review, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in July 2020, looked at 17 studies involving 634 patients. The review suggested that oral minoxidil was a generally effective and well-tolerated alternative to topical minoxidil, though researchers add that larger, controlled studies are needed.5. There’s No Standard Dosage for Oral MinoxidilSattur points out that most of these studies looked at doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 5 mg — less than the doses used for hypertension.
 Chronic telogen effluvium (CTE) is defined as hair loss persisting over 6 months.61 Treatment for CTE can be frustrating and many medications have been tried, including minoxidil. There have been limited clinical trials on topical minoxidil use to treat telogen effluvium. However, oral minoxidil may be a promising treatment option. Recently, a retrospective review was conducted among 36 female patients with CTE treated daily with oral minoxidil at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 mg. Marked reduction in hair shedding was observed at 6 and 12 months. Some patients demonstrated mild facial hypertrichosis, dizziness, and altered blood pressure as adverse events.62Scarring alopeciaIn scarring alopecia, medical treatment should be initiated as early as possible."

Mechanism of Action
Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data. The herbal tonic was developed by Hoxsey’s great grandfather, whose horse was reportedly cured of a leg tumor after eating wild herbs.

Alternative medical treatment
Hoxsey Therapy or Hoxsey Method is an alternative medical treatment promoted as a cure for cancer. The treatment consists of a caustic herbal paste for external cancers or an herbal mixture for "internal" cancers, combined with laxatives, douches, vitamin supplements, and dietary changes. Reviews by major medical bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society,[1] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,[2] and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,[3] have found no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The sale or marketing of the Hoxsey Method was banned in the United States by the FDA on September 21, 1960 as a "worthless and discredited" remedy and a form of quackery. [4]
Currently, the Hoxsey Method is primarily marketed by the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico. Hoxsey Therapy is also marketed over the Internet; in June 2008, the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator noted that "There is no scientific evidence that it has any value to treat cancer, yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that Hoxsey treatment is effective against the disease.
 He then blended various parts of these plants to produce three specialized “cancer cures.” The secret formulas were handed down and eventually put to use by Harry’s father in treating cancer patients. While he claimed spectacular results, apparently the formula did not work for Mr. Hoxsey who developed cancer of the jaw and decided that conventional radiation was a better option. Harry denied his father’s medical history and claimed to his dying day that the AMA had fabricated a false death certificate and that his father had really died of an infection. In any case, the elder Hoxsey passed the cancer formula to Harry on his deathbed and warned him that “they will persecute you, slander you and try to drive you off the face of the earth.” A savior was born. The secret formula turned out to be a mixture of red clover, prickly ash, buckhorn, alfalfa and potassium iodide. But according to Hoxsey, it was the specific blend and amounts used that were critical."

L-theanine benefits and usesMost known for helping people relax, L-theanine has other potential health benefits, including:Anxiety and stress reliefSipping on a hot cup of tea can help you feel at ease, and research suggests that it not only relaxes the mind, but it also does so without causing drowsiness (1).In a review of five randomized controlled trials that included 104 participants, four trials linked L-theanine with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations (2).Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry focused on people living with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers found that L-theanine decreased anxiety and improved symptoms (3). Increased focusPaired with caffeine, L-theanine may help increase focus and attention.A small study found that a combination of L-theanine (97 milligrams, or mg) and caffeine (40 mg) helped a group of young adults focus better during demanding tasks. A typical cup of coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine (4, 5).The study’s participants also felt more alert and less tired in general. Better immunitySome research suggests that L-theanine may improve the function of the body’s immune system.
 [4,5,6] However, it is important to remember that findings in animal studies don't necessarily translate to humans. So let's dive into the recently available research unveiling the “stress-reducing” effect of L-theanine in humans. L-theanine’s impact on stress and anxiety: Human studies
A recent 2016 systematic review looked at all available human clinical trials that examined the effects of supplemental L-theanine consumption (200-400 mg/day) on stress and anxiety. Of the five randomized controlled trials, four trials found that L-theanine was associated with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations. [1] However, these studies only looked at those experiencing acute stress, and more research is needed to evaluate L-theanine’s impact on chronic stress. One randomized control trial showed particular promise for the future of L-theanine research.

Evidence:"Steam inhalation doesn’t actually kill the virus responsible for the infection. At best, steam inhalation might make you feel a little better as your body fights your cold. One review of six clinical trials evaluating steam therapy in adults with the common cold had mixed results. Some participants had symptom relief, but others didn’t. Additionally, some participants experienced discomfort inside the nose from the steam inhalation.Another recent clinical trial looked at the use of steam inhalation in treating chronic sinus symptoms. The study, however, didn’t find that steam inhalation was beneficial for the majority of sinus symptoms, except for headache.

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  
Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:
The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)
Steam Inhalation and Sleep
There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  
Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.
 Helps Provide Relief from BronchitisAn old study suggests that steam inhalation in bronchitis patients eases respiratory distress for a short time.3. Helps Cure Sinus IssuesAccording to research, steam inhalation can also help calm sinusitis symptoms like sore throat, headache, and blocked nose. However, it does not help with congestion.Benefits of Steam Inhalation During ColdSteam inhalation is beneficial to open blocked nasal passages during cold and sinusitis. Steam provides moisture to dry mucus membranes and loosens congestion in the chest. Also, the hot vapour can help reduce bacterial infections in the nasal passage and reduce common cold symptoms.How to Use Steam Inhaler?You can try steam inhalation at home by boiling water in a pan. However, the easiest way to do steam inhalation is with steam inhalers available in the market."

Evidence:"Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety. The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better. How does exercise help depression and anxiety? Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:
Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety
Regular exercise has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you:

      Exercise for depression
Being depressed can leave you feeling low in energy, which might put you off being more active.Regular exercise can boost your mood if you have depression, and it's especially useful for people with mild to moderate depression.Any type of exercise is useful, as long as it suits you and you do enough of it. Exercise should be something you enjoy; otherwise, it will be hard to find the motivation to do it regularly. How often do you need to exercise?To stay healthy, adults should do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week.Read more about:physical activity guidelines for adults aged 19 to 64 years oldphysical activity guidelines for older adultsIf you have not exercised for a while, start gradually and aim to build up towards achieving 150 minutes a week.Any exercise is better than none and even a brisk 10-minute walk can clear your mind and help you relax. Find out more about walking for health. How to get started with exerciseFind an activity you can do regularly. You can take part in a team sport, attend classes at a leisure centre, or just be more active in your daily routine by walking or cycling instead of travelling by car or public transport.Find out about different types of exercise and the benefits of being more active for fitnessRead about prevention and management of long-term conditions on the GOV.UK websiteFind fitness advice for wheelchair usersFind local exercise classes and sports clubsIf being outdoors appeals to you, Green Gym projects, run by The Conservation Volunteers (TCV), provide exercise for people who do not like the idea of the gym or indoor exercise classes.
 Generally, depressed patients treated in primary care settings receive pharmacologic therapy alone. There is evidence to suggest that the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapies, specifically exercise, can improve treatment outcomes for many patients. Exercise is a behavioral intervention that has shown great promise in alleviating symptoms of depression. The current review discusses the growing body of research examining the exercise-depression relationship that supports the efficacy of exercise as an adjunct treatment. Databases searched were Medline, PsycLit, PubMed, and SportsDiscus from the years 1996 through 2003. Terms used in the search were clinical depression, depression, exercise, and physical activity."

Evidence:"If you don't have tweezers and need to use your fingers, use a tissue or paper towel.Pull the tick straight out with a slow and steady motion. Avoid squeezing or crushing the tick. Be careful not to leave the head embedded in the skin.Clean the area well with soap and water. Also wash your hands thoroughly.Save the tick in a jar. Watch the person who was bitten carefully over the next week or two for symptoms of Lyme disease (such as rash or fever).If all parts of the tick can't be removed, get medical help. Bring the tick in the jar to your doctor appointment.
 If part of the tick stays in the skin, don't worry. It will eventually come out on its own.Step 3: Release the tick into a jar or zip-locked bag.Step 4: Wash your hands and the site of the bite with soap and water.Step 5: Swab the bite site with alcohol. Then, call your doctor, who might want to see the tick. Sometimes, doctors prescribe a preventive dose of antibiotics for kids at high risk for Lyme disease.Note: Never use petroleum jelly or a hot match to kill and remove a tick. These methods don't get the tick off the skin, and can make it burrow deeper.When Should I Call the Doctor?Call the doctor right away if your child has:a red-ringed rash or skin that's red and irritatedflu-like symptomsjoint pain or a swollen jointfacial paralysis (can't move areas of the face)Other conditions can also cause these symptoms. But having your child seen early means that if it is Lyme disease, treatment can begin quickly.
 "Thoroughly clean the bite (and your hands) with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. The CDC discourages "folklore remedies"  like nail polish, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), and heat that lift the tick away from the skin, since they rely on waiting for a tick to detach, which takes longer. "Anything that delays removing a tick is a bad idea," says Robert B. Kimsey, Ph.D, an entomologist with the University of California, Davis specializing in ticks. "Suffocating a tick is not very effective," Dr. Kardos says. "Covering a tick with petroleum jelly or nail polish may even cause the tick to become slippery and more difficult to grasp."

Evidence:"These ingredients aren’t designed to kill lice and their eggs (called nits) like prescription and OTC formulas. But many people are using mayonnaise in an effort to find a safe, more natural lice remedy.To effectively get rid of lice, you need to get rid of both the parasites and the nits. The theory behind mayonnaise is that it will help “suffocate” the lice so that they die off. However, there’s no solid proof that this method works. If anything, you might see reduced activity in your scalp temporarily, but the lice will likely come back. Another drawback to using mayonnaise for lice is that it won’t catch and suffocate all the parasites as effectively as other methods.
 Even though it is messy, in theory, as a treatment for lice mayonnaise can kill the bugs. When using mayo to kill lice, be sure to remove everything from the hair, including all eggs and bugs, following the below steps:Apply the mayonnaise for lice thoroughly to the hair. You just want to keep applying it and ensure that every single strand of hair is coated, all the way down to the tip of the hair. Use a regular comb to run through the hair with the mayonnaise to ensure the strands are fully saturated.Comb out all of the lice eggs with a professional-grade nit comb. This usually involves sectioning the hair and combing each section until no more eggs or bugs remain in the hair.

Evidence:"Researchers attribute date’s iron-boosting properties to its iron content, as well as to the fact that it contains multiple nutrients that enhance iron absorption and hemoglobin production.To give you a better idea of how dates can improve both iron and hemoglobin levels, here’s a quick overview of some of those studies.1. Dates Improve Iron Deficiency Anemia in Girls Aged Aged 8 to 10A study published in the journal Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics showed that adding dates to the diets of young, iron-deficient girls, improves iron and hemoglobin levels (source).Here’s a summary of what the study entailed, as well as the results:At the start of this study, the mean hematocrit (Hct) was 34.24 g/dL, the mean ferritin (standard measure for iron) was 47.07 μg/dL and the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.19 g/dL.The participants consumed Mazafati dates for 2 months. No other dietary changes were made.After 2 months the girls showed improvements in all categories: mean hematocrit (Hct) was 37.17 g/dL, mean ferritin was 53.98 μg/dL and mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 12.05 g/dL.Dates contain vitamin A, which helps with the synthesis of hemoglobin. Interestingly, some studies and experts state that vitamin A deficiency tends to go along with anemia. And low vitamin A can decrease iron absorption, further contributing to the development of anemia. Furthermore, another report indicates that taking vitamin A and iron together seems to be more effective at preventing iron deficiency, versus taking them individually (1, 2, 3).Vitamin C is also found in dates and it’s known to enhance iron absorption.From a scientific perspective, the results of this study were considered statistically significant.2.
 Educational dropout and learning disabilities in the early years of schooling may be due to insufficient iron stores, and many mental and behavioral problems in children have been attributed to IDA.10 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of four basic strategies including iron supplementation, appropriate nutrition education, the enrichment of foods with iron compounds, and the control of parasitic and infectious diseases to prevent and control anemia and iron deficiency anemia.11 Lack of knowledge in both nutritional needs and nutritional values of different foods is a major contributor to the prevalence of malnutrition among primary school children and vulnerable groups. Schools as a broad base serve a large population of children and play an important role in the transfer of health information to individuals, families, and society.12 Nutrition education applied should be easily adapted to socio-economic status, dietary habits and locally available traditional food resources.13 Considering the role of nutrition disorder in the prevalence of IDA,14 strategies for nutritional improvement are safe ways to control and prevent micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron.15 Therefore, if IDA is diagnosed early, it can be treated or prevented by modifying the nutritional status and the administration of iron supplements.16Considering the prevalence of IDA and the effect of nutritional education on the prevention and control of it, the use of date fruit can contribute to controlling IDA. Dates (Phoenix dactylifera) are one among the fruits used in the human diet that possess a high nutritional value.17 There are 314 calories in 100 g of date. Ten minerals are reported, the major being selenium, copper, potassium, and magnesium. The consumption of 100 g of dates can provide over 15% of the recommended daily allowance from these minerals.18 In addition, the amount of iron in dates is about 0.3 mg to 10.4 mg per 100 g. Therefore, eating a few dates daily will provide your body’s daily iron. Also, dates contain vitamin C and fiber, which increase iron absorption.19 Yossef et al (2015) found that the use of dates in the treatment of IDA of children is beneficial and the iron content in 100 g of black dates is reported to be 166.5 mg.20 Dates have also been shown to contain other properties that are useful in treatment or prevention of events such as fatigue, reinforcement of kidney, chronic cough, rheumatoid arthritis and back pain, diarrhea, kidney stone, and peptic ulcers.19,21 Dates contain anticancer properties that may also help prevent the disease.22 Dates also serve as a good source of natural antioxidants.23 Dates can improve hemoglobin (Hgb) levels via increasing erythrocyte production.24 It seems that the  prevalence of IDA  is  high  in female students of Zahedan City, Iran,7 and the abundance of dates in this area.25 Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of consumption of date fruit on IDA among primary school girl students.26Methods and MaterialsThis was a semi-experimental study.
 The foods that can improve anemia are not just limited to animal products and organ meats. There are many other types of foods like dates, leafy greens, legumes, nuts, and seeds, which can all improve iron-deficiency anemia. In addition, these foods offer a variety of vitamins that will keep you feeling healthy! Summary 
Iron deficiency anemia is caused by insufficient red blood cell production in the body. Eating foods rich in iron can help you increase your iron levels, managing your anemia symptoms. Such foods include dates, meats, organ meats, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds."

Evidence:"Some people who used zinc nasal sprays had permanent loss of smell. Taken all together, research shows mixed results for zinc and colds. For that reason, zinc can't be recommended to shorten your cold symptoms. Researchers can't say why zinc works in some studies and not others. There are still questions about which type of zinc works best. Research also doesn't show what amount of zinc is the best.
 Cochrane Database Syst Rev:"Zinc for the common cold" and "Zinc supplementation for the prevention of pneumonia in children aged 2 months to 59 months.

"Efficacy of zinc given as an adjunct to the treatment of severe pneumonia: A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials." © 2022 WebMD, LLC. All rights reserved.
 Zinc has been in and out of favor as a treatment for the common cold, based on contradictory findings, since the first randomized trial was published in 1984.3A 1998 systematic review (which did not include a quantitative synthesis of data) suggested that zinc was beneficial in reducing the duration and severity of cold symptoms.4 A meta-analysis published in 2000 found that zinc was ineffective compared with placebo in reducing the likelihood that cold symptoms were present after 7 days.5 A meta-analysis published in June 2011 concluded that zinc lozenges reduce the duration of cold symptoms by 12% to 48%, but only at daily doses >75 mg.6These conflicting results have made it difficult to recommend zinc to patients—until now.STUDY SUMMARY: Zinc for colds? Cochrane review provides convincing evidenceThe 2011 Cochrane review that’s the focus of this PURL1 addressed the question: Does zinc reduce the duration and severity of the common cold? The review also assessed zinc’s ability to prevent colds, although only 2 studies focused on prevention. The researchers included only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which oral zinc supplementation was used for ≥5 consecutive days for treatment or ≥5 months for prevention. Studies included patients of any age, taking any dosage and any formulation of zinc.Primary outcomes included the duration of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and the incidence of the common cold in prevention studies. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients symptomatic after 3, 5, and 7 days of treatment, the time to resolution of individual symptoms (eg, cough), change in individual symptom scores, school absences, antibiotic use, and adverse effects.Thirteen therapeutic trials and 2 prevention trials met the inclusion criteria."

Evidence:"Magnet therapy or wearing copper jewelry may seem attractive for easing your arthritis pain simply and inexpensively. But studies confirm these treatments are ineffective for arthritis pain. According to studies published over the years, magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets don’t work on arthritis pain or stiffness. Placebo-controlled trials have been done in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A few small studies showed that magnets may offer some pain benefit in osteoarthritis, but these results have not been replicated or expanded to larger trials. “In my research I set out to confuse the heck out of participants so they couldn't tell which device was real and which was a placebo,” says one researcher, Stewart Richmond, PhD, research fellow at the University of York, in England.
 In addition, researchers do in rare cases get the testing wrong or simply fail to predict potential safety problems.A combination of being frustrated with a difficult condition and the limits of both medicine and natural healing processes can lead patients to trying anything to get better. However, it is important to carry out your own research and find out the most effective treatments possible for a given condition and whether to expect a full cure.In spite of all the evidence advising that copper bracelets are not effective, there may be some benefit to them.They are affordable, and if a patient believes in their effectiveness and comes to no harm from missing out on other, proven treatments, the placebo effect can help symptoms.People looking to treat arthritic swelling and pain should be aware, that any perceived benefits are most likely to occur as a result of the placebo[DRW1] effect. There do not appear to be any physical properties of copper bracelets that directly influence the arthritis.

Other symptoms
Athlete's foot can also affect your soles or sides of your feet.
 Antifungal creams and sprays are also effective at managing the infection. Continue treatment for one to two weeks after the infection has cleared to prevent it from recurring.Make sure your feet get plenty of air. If you can't go barefoot or wear sandals, wear synthetic socks which will wick away moisture. Cotton tends to trap the moisture and promote fungal growth. Wear shoes made of a porous material.If not treated properly and promptly, athlete's foot can be very stubborn. Even when treated with antifungal drugs, the infection may take several weeks to disappear and may come back after treatment.Most of the time it responds well to these over-the-counter interventions.
 This easy to use cream has been specially formulated with clotrimazole, an anti-fungal/anti-bacterial medication that treats all types of athlete’s foot without inflammation. The active ingredient clotrimazole is anti-fungal to treat the fungi that causes your athlete’s foot as well as being anti-bacterial to help get rid of the bacteria that can cause your feet to smell. Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that affects the skin on your feet. It is caused by fungi that thrive in warm and moist environments like changing rooms, showers and public pools."

Whatever path you decide to take—whether it is Palmer’s cream-, oil-, or mask-based products, natural cocoa butter is safe to use on your body while pregnant and helps reduce stretch marks as you and your baby grow. Look to Palmer’s full line of cocoa butter products to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.
 Cocoa butter helps to soften stretch marks and even prevent them. In early pregnancy, it is recommended to begin applying cocoa butter to the areas that can be easily affected by stretch marks on month one all the way up until delivery. As your body goes back to its pre-pregnancy state, it is also useful to continue using the cocoa butter as the skin starts to shrink back. Cocoa butter is also great for weight loss programs and during growth spurts for teens. You will find that cocoa butter is not just great for stretch marks, but for moisturizing all over the body. It has such a nutrient-rich profile, the benefits extend far beyond preventing and treating existing stretch marks."

Details for This Review
Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings
Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea
Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)
Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 
Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 
The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.

 Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►
Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 
What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018.What did the researchers find?Thirty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e."

Proven analgesic efficacy—even when inflammation is present1
In one study at 4 weeks, acetaminophen 4000 mg/day was shown to be as effective as Rx doses of ibuprofen (2400 mg/day) and the maximum OTC dose of ibuprofen (1200 mg/day) for OA of the knee.7
Overrall Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire pain scores have a range of 0 to 3. By one-way analysis of variance among the three groups. No significant differences were observed betweeen the three treatment groups. Adapted from Bradley JD, et al. N Engi J Med.
 Acetaminophen is an analgesic, meaning it relieves pain. Acetaminophen is not an anti-inflammatory, so it does not ease swelling. For this reason, Tylenol Arthritis is best for osteoarthritis and not inflammatory types of arthritis such as rheumatoid, reactive, or gout. Acetaminophen is thought to work by interfering with hormones called prostaglandins, reducing pain sensations within the nerve endings, nervous system, and brain. Tylenol Arthritis can temporarily relieve other types of pain such as general aches, muscle soreness, toothache, menstrual cramps, aches due to cold and flu, and back pain. As with other acetaminophen-containing drugs, Tylenol Arthritis can also help reduce fevers."

Music can relax you, bring back memories of certain times in your life or bring a smile to your face. Research shows a clear link between health and music: music therapy can be used to help combat depression and heal trauma, and listening to music has been shown to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease stress levels. Before the Hartford Symphony Orchestra concert Friday evening, Javeed Sukhera, MD, PhD, chair of psychiatry, Institute of Living, spoke about the history of the IOL and how music can be used for healing. The conversation with HSO Music Director Carolyn Kuan included a candid discussion about depression. The concerts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by the IOL, featured the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, legendary artists who endured lifelong struggles with depression.

 Some characteristics of these individuals, such as a tendency toward symbolic processing and imagery, or particular personality traits, may favour engagement in music therapy.For cliniciansMusic therapy, when added to treatment as usual, seems to improve symptoms of depression (moderate‐quality evidence). Music therapy seems to be beneficial also for anxiety (low‐quality evidence), which is often a comorbidity of depression. Severely depressed individuals often experience impairment in maintaining relationships and work engagements. In this regard, evidence suggests significant amelioration in the level of functioning among those who attended music therapy sessions (low‐quality evidence). Improvements in depressive symptoms and functioning are likely interrelated: Mitigation of depressive symptoms may lead to better outcomes in the socio‐occupational sphere, and vice versa. In fact, positive effects might help support motivation as well as emotional and relational competencies of people affected by depression, from adolescents to older adults."

Evidence:"Conclusions:
      Available data indicate that marine omega-3 fatty acids improve symptoms of BPD, particularly impulsive behavioral dyscontrol and affective dysregulation. Marine omega-3 fatty acids could be considered as add-on therapy. Similar articles
        Pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder: a systematic review for publication purpose. Bellino S, Rinaldi C, Bozzatello P, Bogetto F.
Bellino S, et al. Curr Med Chem.
 Laboratory research has firmly established that experimental creation of omega-3 deficiency causes abnormal behavior in lab animals. And in human studies, researchers have repeatedly discovered associations between omega-3 fatty acid levels and symptoms of psychosis, depression, impulsivity and self-harm. Emerging research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can be used therapeutically in borderline personality disorder. In treatment studies, researchers rely on just two omega-3 components: EPA and DHA. Silvio Bellino and colleagues from the University of Turin in Italy showed that EPA (1200 mg per day) plus DHA (800 mg per day), when added to therapeutic doses of Depakote, reduced impulsivity, anger, and self-harm in a group of patients with borderline personality disorder. In a separate study from Harvard University, Mary Zanarini and Frances Frankenburg showed that an 8-week course of treatment with EPA (1000 mg per day) outperformed placebo treatment in reducing depression and aggression in women with borderline personality.
 Those treated with this compound also experienced a significantly greater reduction in their overall aggression as well as their depressive symptoms than those treated with placebo. These results are consistent with the findings of recent reports concerning omega-3 fatty acids as an effective adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder (3) and recurrent depression (4). However, the results of the current study extend these findings by suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe cases of borderline personality disorder.The main limitations of this study are that only women were studied and all subjects were moderately ill. Whether similar results would be found for male subjects or subjects with a more severe symptom picture is unknown.Studies assessing different doses of E-EPA for longer periods of time in larger samples are needed.TABLE 1Enlarge tableReceived April 3, 2002; revision received Aug. 8, 2002; accepted Sept. 5, 2002.

 The findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in this group of patients.Trial Registration 
    ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02687815  
                                Introduction
As of 2018, an estimated 5.5 million children in the US had asthma, a major cause of health care utilization and costs.1 In 2018, asthma exacerbations led to more than 546 000 emergency department (ED) visits and 80 000 hospitalizations.1 
Several observational studies have linked low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (henceforth, “vitamin D”) levels to severe asthma exacerbations, lower lung function, and reduced response to corticosteroids.2-5 Such findings may be explained by immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, including regulatory T-cell induction, attenuation of Th2 and Th17 responses, enhancement of IL-10 production, and inhibition of airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and collagen deposition.6-9 Vitamin D may attenuate viral-induced asthma attacks by reducing rhinovirus replication in bronchial epithelium, promoting interferon-mediated antiviral pathways and inducing production of antimicrobial peptides.10,11 
Quiz Ref IDA meta-analysis of clinical trials using participant-level data showed that vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with lower risk of asthma exacerbations, but the pooled estimate was not significant among children younger than 16 years old.12 More recently, a comprehensive review of vitamin D3 for the prevention of wheeze attacks found insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D3 supplementation in children.13 Previous pediatric randomized clinical trials, however, have not focused on children with low vitamin D levels or who are at high risk for severe asthma exacerbations. Moreover, existing trials did not monitor vitamin D levels or did not show consistently improved levels after supplementation. Children with a recent severe asthma exacerbation are at highest risk for subsequent exacerbations, independent of disease severity, treatment, or control.14 The primary hypothesis for this trial was that supplementation with vitamin D3 would improve the time to a severe exacerbation in high-risk children, aged 6 to 16 years, with vitamin D insufficiency and taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma. The secondary hypotheses were that this protective effect would result from reduced incidence of viral-induced exacerbations or enhanced response to corticosteroids. Methods
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at each participating institution, and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute monitored the study. Written parental consent was obtained for participating children, from whom written assent was also obtained."

Evidence:"This belief may stem from studies linking soy-rich diets to a lower risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease in adults (6, 7, 8, 9).However, there’s currently insufficient evidence demonstrating that soy formula use in infancy reduces a baby’s risk of developing these diseases later in life (1, 2, 3).Similarly, there’s no strong evidence that soy formula reduces digestive issues like colic or offers any additional protection against allergies. Therefore, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (3, 10). On the other hand, experts agree that soy formula is the most appropriate choice for full-term babies with galactosemia or hereditary lactase deficiency — two medical conditions that prevent babies from breaking down the natural sugars in cow’s milk (1, 2). Soy formula is also the most appropriate choice for vegan families. Although the vitamin D3 in most soy formulas is currently sourced from sheep lanolin, they’re the closest available option to fully vegan baby formula.summaryMany believe that soy formula use in infancy reduces colic, allergies, and the risk of disease later in life, but more research is needed to confirm this. Soy formula is the best feeding choice for vegan families and babies with specific medical conditions.Are soy isoflavones harmful to babies?Soy formulas are naturally rich in isoflavones –– a plant compound with a structure similar to that of the hormone estrogen.
 Further research may be warranted to determine the role of soy formulas for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants unable to be breast fed with a strong family history of allergy or cow's milk protein intolerance.Plain language summarySoy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infantsWhen babies are not exclusively breastfed, evidence suggests that using a soy formula instead of a cow's milk formula does not reduce allergies in infants and children. Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula.BackgroundAllergy, which affects over 20% of people, is a specific reaction to a normally harmless substance (allergen) characterised by a specific IgE response. Common allergies include allergic rhinitis or hay fever, asthma, eczema or atopic dermatitis and food allergies.
 "Feeding with a soy formula should not be recommended for the prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk (for these conditions)," researchers from the Westmead Hospital in New South Wales, Australia, write in the latest issue of The Cochrane Library Newsletter.Breast Is BestFour percent to 6% of children have food allergies, and a close family history is the best predictor of risk. A child that has two parents with food allergies has about a 75% chance of also developing allergies herself. Although the researchers did not review studies that included breastfed babies, pediatric allergy experts contacted by WebMD say the best clinical evidence suggests that breastfeeding is by far the best choice for high-risk babies.The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends "exclusive breastfeeding as the hallmark for food allergy prevention" for at least six months. It further states that breastfeeding should continue for at least a year, although other foods should also be introduced after the sixth month. "The best evidence that we have suggests that breastfeeding can help prevent food allergies in children at high risk," New York allergist Clifford Bassett, MD, tells WebMD. Bassett is a spokesman for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology."

Evidence:"A review of high-quality studies shows that overweight people who took chitosan did not lose significant amounts of weight.Scientists have also looked at whether chitosan helps lower cholesterol levels. In some recent well-designed studies, chitosan reduced total cholesterol as well as LDL "bad" cholesterol. But other studies have shown conflicting results and more research is needed.Early studies in people have hinted that varying forms of chitosan might also help:Crohn's diseaseDental cavitiesAnemia due to dialysis in people with kidney failurePeriodontitisThose who have plastic surgery using donor tissueAgain, more research is needed to study chitosan for these conditions.Optimal doses of chitosan have not been set for any condition. Quality and active ingredients in supplements may vary widely. This makes it hard to set a standard dose.Can you get chitosan naturally from foods?No. Chitosan is not found naturally in foods.
 Analyses involving all trials indicated that chitosan preparations result in a small but statistically significant greater reduction in body weight (weighted mean difference -1.7 kg; 95% confidence interval -2.1, -1.3 kg, P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. Analyses restricted to high-quality studies showed that reductions in weight [-0.6 (-1.2, 0.1) kg, P = 0.11] were less than in lower quality studies [-2.3 (-2.7, -1.8) kg, P < 0.00001]. Results obtained from high-quality trials indicate that the effect of chitosan on body weight is minimal and unlikely to be of clinical significance. Comment in

 They compared weight loss outcomes in people taking chitosan supplements with those of people taking a placebo (2).Results showed that chitosan supplementation slightly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI) when paired with a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity (2). These results support the findings of a similar, older review, which found that chitosan supplements may be more effective than a placebo as part of a short-term treatment plan for overweight and obesity (2, 8).Both reviews noted improvements in cholesterol levels and blood pressure (2, 8).However, the researchers reported that many studies on chitosan supplements were of poor quality and that there was significant variability among results. The studies that were deemed high quality found chitosan’s impact on body weight to be minimal (2, 8). A small 2014 clinical trial found that supplementing with 3 grams of chitosan per day may be more effective for weight loss when paired with 2 grams of L-ascorbic acid — a type of vitamin C (9). SummaryThere is not consistent scientific evidence supporting chitosan use for weight loss. Chitosan supplements’ effect on body weight is likely clinically insignificant.Reduced cholesterol levelsChitosan may have a greater impact on cholesterol levels than on weight loss."

Evidence:"Walking at a comfortable pace — whether it’s indoors or outdoors — is an excellent low-impact exercise.Stationary bikeUsing a stationary bike on an easy setting allows you to slowly build your strength. Using the bike in your home allows you to avoid traffic and stop when you feel strained.Water exercises Freestyle swimming provides a moderate workout. Walking in water up to your waist lightens the load on your joints while also providing enough resistance for your muscles to become stronger. This can greatly improve pain and daily function of the hips. YogaRegular yoga can help improve flexibility of the joints, strengthen muscles, and lessen pain. Some yoga positions can add strain to your hips, so if you feel discomfort, ask your instructor for modifications.
 Types of Exercise
Getting physical activity is an important part of managing osteoarthritis. But if you aren’t currently active, it’s important to start an exercise routine as soon as you start to have pain. A variety of land and water exercises can improve your hip muscles and OA pain, including strengthening, aerobic and flexibility activities. A physical therapist can develop a specific program of hip strengthening and flexibility exercises to help get your pain under control. Overall, it’s important to get moving and maintain the activities you enjoy in daily life for as long as possible. Even everyday movements – getting out of a chair, getting dressed, walking out to the car and leaving the house – use your muscles and keep you active.
 Begin with light and easy exercises and gradually increase the intensity, frequency, or duration of the activity as tolerated.Prepare the joint: Always do warmups before and cooldowns after every exercise. Always begin with stretching or other ROM exercises to prepare the body for strength and aerobic exercises.Respect pain: When the hip or other body parts feel painful, stopping for a while or adjusting the exercise to a more tolerable level can help.Physical therapists recommend people modify activities as necessary. Arthritis symptoms may come and go. A person should try to stay active and perform activities based on what feels tolerable at the moment.Home remediesAside from exercise, a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis.Alternative remedies are things people can introduce to their daily routine at home. These include:Hydration: Drinking enough water may help the body produce synovial fluid, keep joints lubricated, flush out toxins, and reduce inflammation.Assistive devices: Using aids such as reachers may help people avoid positions that cause pain. Walking supports can help improve mobility while distributing the weight outside of the body, reducing stress on the joint.Diet: Following a balanced diet can help a person maintain a moderate weight and reduce pressure on the hip joint.Heat and cold therapy: Applying hot and cold compresses may improve joint stiffness and swelling."

Evidence:"Antioxidant supplements are commercially available to help treat male infertility, but research on its effects on semen quality and rates of pregnancy and live birth are limited. The new study reports on results from the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility Trial (MOXI), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted at nine sites across the United States. The study enrolled 171 couples where the male partner had at least one abnormal reading on an analysis evaluating sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality; the female partners had normal fertility test results. Men received a placebo or an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins C, E and D, selenium, l-carnitine, zinc, folic acid and lycopene for at least three months and up to six months. MOXI was supported by NICHD’s Reproductive Medicine Network. The study team found no statistically significant differences in sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality between the placebo and antioxidant groups after three months.
 An estimated 48.5 million couples worldwide are infertile,1 and approximately 40%–50% percent of cases are attributed to female factors.2,3 Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are a cornerstone of infertility treatment, with more than 600,000 cycles performed each year in North America and Europe alone.4–6 Nevertheless, success rates remain relatively low; in 2015 in the US, approximately only one of three ART cycles started with the intention to transfer an embryo resulted in a live birth.4 It is thus of vital importance to identify potentially modifiable predictors of treatment outcome, including diet.7Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress impairs gamete and embryo development during ART.8 In addition, infertile women have been reported to have a lower total antioxidant status.9,10 It has thus been suggested that antioxidant supplements may improve infertility treatment outcomes with ART.11 However, high intake of some vitamins, such as vitamin A, may result in adverse reproductive outcomes.12,13 Furthermore, the relation between micronutrients and ART outcomes may not necessarily be linear.14While several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have addressed this question, their findings are inconsistent. A 2017 Cochrane review of RCTs concluded that antioxidant supplementation during the course of infertility treatment showed limited benefit for increasing the probability of pregnancy or live birth and that, among women undergoing ART specifically, antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate.11 However, as acknowledged by the authors, this evidence suffers from multiple important gaps. First, few trials reported effects of the intervention on live birth rates. In addition, few of the trials included in the meta-analysis tested the same intervention and estimated pooled data from interventions as dissimilar as multiple micronutrient blends (including proprietary blends whose composition cannot be established) to selected combinations of specific micronutrients at considerably different doses, to interventions of substances without direct antioxidant potential. These issues make it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the effects–or lack thereof–of antioxidants on ART outcomes. A particularly important gap to move the field forward is to identify which specific antioxidants and at which doses may offer benefit to inform the design of new trials.
 However, many antioxidant supplements taken to improve fertility are unregulated and there is limited evidence on their safety and effects. The researchers analysed data from 28 trials involving a total of 3,548 women attending fertility clinics. Antioxidants did not increase the women's chances of conceiving or having a baby. The results show no significant increase in women becoming pregnant when taking antioxidants compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid. "There is no evidence in this review that suggests taking an antioxidant is beneficial for women who are trying to conceive," said lead researcher, Marian Showell, who works in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. Only 14 of the trials reported on adverse effects such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy."
