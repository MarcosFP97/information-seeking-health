Evidence:"This study showed that green tea extract contributes to significant decline in bleeding of the socket caused by tooth extraction as well as reduction of oozing.1. IntroductionGingiva is a connective and epithelial tissue that covers the jaw bone around the teeth [1]. Usually, after tooth extraction, especially molars, bleeding occurs due to creation of tooth socket. The amount of bleeding differs based on the tooth type and extent of damage to the tissue and continues in some patient for 1 to 2 days, as the consequent blood clots are unstable and removed with a partial pressure [2]. Most of the time, bleeding is controllable; however, because of bleeding complications like sluggishness, lethargy, and anemia, prevention of bleeding after tooth extraction is mandatory.Several methods have been suggested to reduce the amount of bleeding including the use of anesthetics and materials with vasoconstrictive properties like epinephrine (1/1000), the use of chlorhexidine gel in the days before surgery to reduce the microbial load and topical inflammation [3], and the use of cellulose tampons [4] such as Surgicel tampon [5] and Gelatamp sponge [6], use of systemic preparations of tranexamic acid and vitamin K [7], and application of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue [8].Cellulose tampons stop bleeding to an acceptable extent during 10–15 minutes, but, due to high cost, there is no public access to it [4, 5]. The so-called “Gelatamp” sponges have also shown good effect on cessation of bleeding and reduction of tooth extraction side effects [6]."

Evidence:"The benefits of crystals 
The proposed healing benefits of crystals predominantly surround areas of mental wellbeing; including feelings of increased tranquility, positivity and focus, as well as enhanced immunity and natural pain relief. Individual crystals are also known to have their own special energies that can align to different areas of your life, with their shape and colour – as well as their type – affecting their influence. Adele, for example, has been open about her battle with stage fright before shows and is frequently quoted talking about her use of crystals to calm her nerves. As someone who doesn't present as particularly 'woo woo', her endorsement serves to validate their benefits for those who are crystal-curious but might not be knowledgeable on energetic traditions like acupuncture, yoga or ayurveda. Victoria Beckham is another A-list fan, telling Allure that she travels with her crystals because she's "quite a superstitious person", and reportedly uses them backstage at her fashion shows."

Evidence:"A 2016 study examined the effects of collagen supplements on individuals with osteoarthritis; results showed that collagen reduced pain, stiffness and mobility. A 2009 study that involved participants with rheumatoid arthritis also showed that taking collagen improved pain, morning stiffness, tenderness and swelling. While the effects weren’t as strong as typical treatment options (particularly in the case of rheumatoid arthritis), improvement was possible. The Arthritis Foundation warns that more research is needed to determine just how beneficial collagen could be for various types of arthritis. But one thing is certain: this protein holds promise for joint pain and other symptoms, including swelling and stiffness. 4."

Evidence:"That time has arrived.It’s been a little over 14 years since the first iPhone was released that ushered in the smartphone era. The newest research into whether there is a direct correlation between cellphones and cancer is shocking.This information is important. Share this post with your family and friends, too. You might save a life.What exactly does the research say?Over the years, there have been many different studies about the potential health impacts of cellphone radiation, from the earliest models to the latest 5G handsets, with mixed results. That's why new research from the University of California, Berkeley really caught my eye. It suggests there is a link between cellphone use and an increased risk for tumors, particularly on the right side of the brain.As part of the study, Berkeley researchers looked at stats from nearly 50 other studies conducted worldwide, including in the U.S., Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.They found that if a person uses a cellphone for more than 1,000 hours over 10 years, the risk of tumor development increases by 60%."

Learn about hereditary cancer
Knowledge of an increased genetic risk enables you to work with your healthcare provider to create a personalized plan designed to prevent or detect cancer at an earlier and more treatable stage. 10-15% of most cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations.1,

4,
13
Hereditary cancer is caused by an inherited genetic mutation. It is typical to see a recurring pattern of cancer across two to three generations—like multiple individuals diagnosed with the same type of cancer(s) and individuals diagnosed with cancer much younger than average. Familial cancer refers to cancer that appears to occur more frequently in families than is expected from chance alone."

Evidence:"Vaccines and their connection to autism have been the subject of continuous debate. Some parents are concerned that vaccines, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and preservatives used in other childhood vaccines, may play a role in developing autism in their children. This systemic review explores the link between vaccination and autism in children. We conducted a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar. We included papers written in the English language from 1998 to 2022, conducting human research that examines the relationship between vaccination and the development of autism using appropriate quality assessment tools. Two reviewers independently reviewed the content of the included studies."

Evidence:"“We started out with a question about oxygen starvation and the circadian clock, and we ended up discovering a new mechanism by which acidic conditions in tissues shut off a lot of things—including the cell’s molecular clock,” muses Dang. The finding that something as simple as baking soda could possibly help reverse this effect and render quiescent cancer cells susceptible to cancer therapies excites Dang. “It’s not some $100,000 per year drug. It’s literally just baking soda.” Dang and his team are now looking into how acidity might affect immunotherapy and further exploring the acid-induced quiescence of cancer cells. The study was supported by Ludwig Cancer Research, the US National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Patel Scholar Award, the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy and the US National Cancer Institute."

Evidence:"But it could come down to simple tweaks in your diet - such as cutting back on your morning fruit juice. Research has shown that while an orange or apple may help ward off type 2 diabetes, juices made from the fruits can have the complete opposite effect. A study looked at fruit consumption among more than 187,000 men and women in the US over an almost 25-year period. Some 6.5 per cent of participants developed type 2 diabetes - a condition driven by obesity - during the study period. Those who consumed one or more servings of fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 21 per cent. But people who ate at least two servings each week of certain whole fruits — particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples — reduced their risk for type 2 diabetes by as much as 23 per cent compared to those who had less than one serving per month."

A) It's been suggested that magnets can be helpful for pain relief, including low back and knee pain. Magnets can be used in different ways, including wearing them in bracelets, taping them to your joints and using various magnetic devices, including mattress pads. Unfortunately, the evidence is too patchy to make clear recommendations on the kind of magnet therapy that might help you and the use of magnetic bracelets isn't recommended in any of the guidelines for treating the symptoms of arthritis. But some people do find them beneficial for their symptoms and they are safe for most people."

Evidence:"This doesn’t appear to be the case; for example, the speech centres tend to be located on the left side of the brain, regardless of hand preference. Another difficulty for researchers is that handedness isn’t always cut and dried. While some people use one hand exclusively for all tasks, others tend to swap depending on the activity; for example, some people write with their left hand but open jars with their right. It was once believed that a right-handed person has general dominance on the right side of their body, which means their favoured foot, eye and ear are also on their right side. We now know this isn’t the case. Many people may be right-handed but, for example, always take the first step with their left foot."

Evidence:"This is an effect that has been noted in some studies, but new research shows that fish oil has no impact on bad cholesterol levels. Fish Oil Does Not Raise Bad Cholesterol Levels
This past December, the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI) published a new research paper in conjunction with The Cooper Institute on the omega-3s EPA and DHA in fish oil and LDL cholesterol. There is good evidence that people with very high serum triglyceride levels (>500 mg/dL) who are treated with high doses of omega-3, i.e., 4 g/day of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA commonly see a rise in LDL, whether this occurs in the “real world” with generally healthy people taking fish oil supplements for cardioprotection is not clear. This recent study from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS) and FARI sheds new light on this question. The investigators utilized data from more than 9000 healthy men and women who had at least two preventive medical examinations at Cooper Clinic in Dallas over a 10-year period. These examinations routinely included both blood cholesterol testing and measurement of the Omega-3 Index (i.e., red blood cell (RBC) EPA+DHA levels from OmegaQuant Analytics)."

What do we know about addiction to cannabis? Research has shown that using cannabis regularly (daily or almost daily) and over a long time (several months or years), especially when use begins in early adolescence (i.e. age 16 and under), can cause changes in the way the brain and body respond to cannabis and lead to problems with cannabis use and addictionFootnote 8 
Addiction can occur at any age, but the chances are higher while the brain is still developing, which can continue until around 25 years of age.Footnote 4 As well, the younger an individual is when they begin using cannabis, the higher their risk of health problems, including addiction and other mental health issues including psychosis, schizophrenia, social anxiety, and depression.Footnote 9

Evidence:"Physicians must comply with FDA regulations along with state and local pharmacy regulations before dispensing products and prescriptions containing hydroquinone.”The Future of Hydroquinone in the U.S.With so many patients relying on hydroquinone to treat hyperpigmentation, dermatologists and plastic surgeons alike are concerned about its continued availability. This is particularly true for BIPOC patients, who are often disproportionately affected by dyschromia.With an FDA-approved formulation and inclusion on the Bulk Substances list for compounding, many experts feel it’s unlikely that the FDA will entirely remove hydroquinone from the U.S. market anytime soon. But the controversy surrounding the drug has spurred efforts to find safe and effective alternatives to treat hyperpigmentation.A Brief History of Hydroquinone1978: As the first step in creating an official monograph, an FDA advisory panel proposes recommendations for regulating skin bleaching products. Based on evidence presented, the panel suggests that hydroquinone be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) in concentrations of 1.5 percent to 2 percent and labeled to discontinue use after two months if no improvement is made.1982: After public comments, the FDA proposes a tentative final monograph (TFM). The agency rejects an appeal from industry to allow concentrations up to 4 percent hydroquinone based on study findings showing no significant difference in efficacy between 2 percent and 4 percent. The FDA agrees with the panel’s conclusion that high concentrations of hydroquinone with exposure to the sun may cause disfiguring effects.1999: The International Agency for Research and Cancer (IARC) determines that hydroquinone is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans due to inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.2001: The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone due to concerns about leukoderma-en-confetti and exogenous ochronosis.2006: Based on additional research and data, the FDA decides to reverse its recommendation and proposes to classify hydroquinone as not GRASE, effectively withdrawing the tentative final monograph for the skin bleaching category."

Exactly how exercise works in improving your cholesterol levels is still not totally clear. Although there have been studies examining the effects of exercise on cholesterol, these studies have also been coupled with other cholesterol-lowering lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet or losing weight. Recent studies examining the effect of exercise alone reveal a few ways that exercise may help improve your cholesterol levels:
Lipoprotein particle size. Some studies have shown that exercise can change your LDL (aka bad cholesterol).﻿﻿ Smaller lipoproteins, such as small, dense LDL, have been associated with contributing to cardiovascular disease but having larger LDL particles do not carry this same risk. Studies have shown that moderate exercise can increase the size of your LDL particles, which can help to reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In one study, a 12-week endurance exercise program reduced small, dense LDL by up to 17%.﻿﻿

While it may seem like good advice, drinking too much water can lead to a myriad of problems, including brain damage, and dilute the blood stream, leading to water poisoning.‍What Happens When You Drink Too Much Water?Excessive water intake will increase the level of water in the bloodstream, and dilute your blood sodium concentration. When this happens, your body cannot function properly as the electrolytes meant to deliver oxygen and nutrients throughout your organs can no longer balance the level of fluids in your cells.Compulsive water drinking may damage brain cells, and cause a disruption in your brain functions. As excess water enters the bloodstream, cells begin to swell and burst, causing mild symptoms such as a headache, to life threatening symptoms such as shortness of breath. In severe cases, fatal water intoxication causes brain impairment and even death.Drinking too much water can lead to a degradation of your mental state, which may cause nausea, headaches, mental confusion, unconsciousness, and even neurological symptoms."

Evidence:"Let's break it down: Editor's note: We want to acknowledge that weight loss, health and body image are complex subjects — before deciding to go on a diet, we invite you to gain a broader perspective by reading our exploration into the hazards of diet culture. Let's explore coffee for weight loss.“My first thought when I heard about this trend is that it doesn't sound very tasty!” says Alexandra Sowa, MD, a metabolic health physician, clinical professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and founder of SoWell Health. "There is no evidence that there is any particular benefit in drinking these two ingredients together," Dr. Sowa says. But the trend is not without some logic: Black coffee, which is almost calorie-free, has long been a staple of diet plans. That's of course thanks to the caffeine, a stimulant that can rev up your body's engine for the day."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"“In light of current knowledge on their effects on human health, ANSES recommends reducing the population’s exposure to these substances by taking proactive measures to limit dietary exposure.”ANSES said it has “identified several courses of action,” including “reducing the use of nitrites as additives in delicatessen meat.” The agency says that “over half” of exposure to nitrates is “related to the consumption of delicatessen meat due to the nitrite additives used to prepare it.” After analyzing data, ANSES says that the higher the exposure to nitrites and nitrates, “the greater the risk of colorectal cancer in the population.”The statement and subsequent plan to reduce nitrates and nitrites in foods has raised a lot of questions about the link between deli meats and colon cancer. Here’s what you need to know. So, what is the link between charcuterie and colon cancer?It seemingly comes down to nitrates and nitrites, which are a type of sodium (salt) that are used to preserve meat. The levels of these compounds in foods and meat products are regulated and monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that high levels of nitrates have been linked to a slew of health issues, including heart problems, cancer, and blood disorders. The link between processed meats and colon cancer isn’t new."

Evidence:"They also absorb many times their weight in water, resulting in softer, bulkier stools, that passes through the bowel easily and quickly. Because of this action, some digestive tract disorders may be avoided, halted, or even reversed simply by following a high-fiber diet. A softer, larger stool helps prevent constipation and straining. This can help avoid or relieve hemorrhoids and fissures. More bulk means less pressure in the colon, which is important in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulosis (defects in the weakened walls of the colon). In addition, fiber appears to be important in treating diabetes, elevated cholesterol, colon polyps, and cancer of the colon."
Question:Does a high fiber diet help with hemorrhoids?
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"Some taste like cigarettes, while others may have a minty or fruity flavor.Health risksVaping can have several potential adverse effects on a person’s body, including the heart, lungs, teeth, and gums.The heartA recent review indicated that vaping could cause problems with a person’s heart, lungs, and circulation. The evidence suggests that e-cigarettes release toxins that can cause harm. However, the researchers indicate that further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of vaping.One 2019 study found that there was no connection between vaping and heart disease. However, the researchers did indicate that anyone who uses either traditional cigarettes or vaping devices are at an increased risk of developing heart disease.Another 2019 study looking at the same data found an association between vaping and an increased risk of heart attack, heart disease, stroke, or angina.Researchers working on a study in 2018 had similar findings. They found that vaping leads to an increased risk of heart attack regardless of the user’s other lifestyle choices.Further research into the safety of vaping is required to determine the relationship between vaping and the heart. Most researchers do agree that vaping is still safer for the heart than smoking, but vaping still presents risks.The lungsOverall, vaping may be better for a person’s lungs than smoking cigarettes."

Evidence:"The reality of losing weight
As much as we might wish it otherwise, there’s no healthy way to drop a lot of weight rapidly, and if you’re wondering how to use apple cider vinegar to lose belly fat, you’re probably not going to find a quick answer. Drinking something like apple cider vinegar for weight loss won’t work on its own, as apple cider vinegar doesn’t burn fat. But adding it into a routine of eating fewer calories than you burn, a balanced diet with exercise and good sleep, can all help support your weight loss goals. Generally, a week of 1-2 lbs of weight loss is recommended for sustainable weight loss. Much more than that, and it’s unlikely you’re losing fat and more likely your water weight is dropping.15

Evidence:"There are 2 different types of the virus (type 1 and type 2), both of which can affect the genitals. One of the types is the same virus that causes cold sores around the mouth (type 1). Genital herpes causes painful blisters and sores on and around the genitals. It can also sometimes cause problems if it's caught for the first time either very early or very late in pregnancy. How do you get genital herpes? The herpes virus (HSV) is easily passed from person to person by close, direct contact including:
kissing
unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom)
sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used
your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals – this means you can get genital herpes from someone even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation
Sometimes you can catch herpes when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms."
