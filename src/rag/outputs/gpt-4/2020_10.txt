Evidence:"The control group included participants who were not receiving vitamin D supplements (group 3). Then, the patients were monitored for 14 days. It has been shown that regular vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with less severe COVID-19 and a better survival rate in hospitalized patients. However, supplementation with 80,000 IU of vitamin D3 after diagnosis of COVID-19 did not improve the outcome of the COVID-19 treatments.There are reports of the effectiveness of treatment with the vitamin D metabolite - calcifediol - in reducing mortality among patients with COVID-19 (Alcala Diaz et al. 2021). The study included 537 patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV2 infection."

Patients should always read the patient information when taking over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, and follow the instructions on how to take the medicines. Prescribing ibuprofen
Healthcare professionals should consider a patient’s individual risk factors, including any history of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal illness, when prescribing ibuprofen. Additionally, ibuprofen should be used with caution in patients with known renal impairment.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Warm water or saline will protect you from getting sick if you’re exposed to the coronavirus. The answer is false. False reports are circulating that drinking or bathing in warm or hot water, or washing out the inside of your nose with saline (salt) solution, will protect you from COVID-19 if you are exposed to the coronavirus. These reports are not true. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is very tiny and cannot be rinsed or washed out of the throat or nasal passages. The best ways to prevent infection are to get vaccinated, wear a mask, and practice hand hygiene and physical distancing."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This has brought harmful and real consequences, such as the burning down of 5G antennas and physical attacks on workers installing the infrastructure. We have asked our experts to provide some facts about these presumed links.Fact 1. There is no link between 5G and coronavirus.Many noticed that Wuhan was very advanced on 5G rollout, and suspected a possible link with the outbreak of coronavirus in that region. But coronavirus has spread also in many countries that do not have 5G installations. Claims that the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan due to China’s 5G network are unfounded and dangerous. That is why the EU institutions, countries, and many online platforms are actively identifying and fighting the spread of conspiracy theory content that links the coronavirus to 5G networks."

Advisory on Herbal Products Claiming to Prevent or Treat COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) 
21 May 2020 
            Consumer, Healthcare professional, Industry member, Chinese Proprietary Medicines, Health supplements, Traditional medicines, Chinese Proprietary Medicines, General safety, Health supplements, Traditional medicines
Share 
The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is aware of reports of herbal products, including traditional Chinese medicines, being used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients overseas. There is currently insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of any herbal product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. HSA requires any product that claims to treat infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, to be supported by scientific evidence from controlled clinical studies to substantiate that such a product is safe and effective for such a purpose. Any product that makes claims in relation to COVID-19 must first be submitted to HSA to assess the scientific evidence and be registered before it can be supplied locally. At this time, all herbal products formulated for common cold and flu, including traditional Chinese medicines, should only be used to manage symptoms such as headache, runny or blocked nose, sore throat and cough. Consumers should take note of the following:
To date, HSA has not approved any herbal product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19
Do not purchase any herbal products that make such claims, whether they are from local or overseas sources
Products with unsubstantiated claims can cause serious harm to your health
Seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell
Dealers and sellers are reminded not to make any false or misleading claims that the products they are selling can prevent, protect against or treat diseases such as COVID-19."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial (Avendano-Sola, September 2020 - preprint, not peer-reviewed). Overall, in this open-label randomized study, the administration of convalescent plasma was associated with a reduction in the probability of clinical deterioration, ICU admission or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did not require high flow oxygen devices or mechanical ventilation. However, caution must be undertaken when interpreting the results, as the study was stopped early and underpowered. Study population: 
81 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 14 Spanish hospitals. The goal enrollment was 278 patients. 38 were randomized to convalescent plasma (1 unit = 250-300 mL) + standard of care; 43 were randomized to standard of care."

Evidence:"Should you make an appointment for this, too? “Neither the flu vaccine nor the pneumococcal vaccine protects against COVID-19,” says Melanie Ames, FNP, Family Nurse Practitioner at Charlie W. and Golden Bethune Hill Community Health Clinic. “But that’s not why we’re strongly recommending vaccines like these this year.”
Ames says that by getting a flu shot, a pneumococcal shot or any type of vaccine, you reduce your risk of falling ill and needing medical care. And that helps free up resources that are needed right now to fight the COVID-19 virus. With that in mind, here’s what to know before asking your doctor for a pneumococcal shot."

                        The female sex hormone oestrogen may have some protective effect against becoming seriously ill and dying in COVID-19, according to a registry study conducted at Umeå University. If so, this could explain why men are more likely than women to die during the pandemic. Text: Ola Nilsson

“The results are interesting enough to warrant further clinical studies. However, it is absolutely inappropriate to start experimenting with supplements yourself because oestrogen can also cause a number of more or less severe side effects and should only be taken in consultation with a doctor,” says Malin Sund, professor at Umeå University and first author of the study. In the study, the researchers compared the death rates at the beginning of the pandemic for women with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were already being treated with drugs that raised and lowered estrogen levels."

Evidence:"(iStock)Updated May 5
An ingredient found in everyday cold medicine appears to promote infection from the coronavirus, according to a new lab study looking at the impact of over-the-counter and prescription drugs on the coronavirus, led by virus experts at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes. Researchers found that dextromethorphan — found in most over-the-counter cough syrups tablets and gel capsules — caused SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to grow more in a lab setting. The scientists initially said people who have COVID-19 should be cautious about using cold medication that contains the drug until more studies are conducted. “Obviously, if you have COVID-19, you're coughing and you're reaching on the shelf for the cough syrup,” said Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UCSF and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. “We're throwing out a caveat here, at least in the laboratory setting -- in the context of this drug, you actually see increased infection.”

Krogan said he, himself, if he had COVID-19, would "think twice about using some of these cough syrups until more information was available to us." Later, Krogan softened that advice in an interview with NBC's Today show."
Question:Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Six case–controlled studies were conducted in four countries (China, the US, Thailand and Bangladesh). One of the studies involved participants from the general population, and the other five studies involved only healthcare workers. The study concluded that wearing a mask significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially for healthcare workers, which reduced the risk of infection by nearly 70 percent. A prospective cohort study [13] in the USA evaluated the potential risk for increased virus transmission by measuring the secondary attack rates (SARs) of COVID-19 between persons exposed when both parties were masked and those exposed when >1 person was unmasked. The analysis results suggested that proper mask use is very effective for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, lowering the SAR among contacts by half. An epidemiologic study in Germany employed public regional data regarding the number of COVID-19 infections [5]."

As the COVID-19 cases continue to grow across India and other parts of the world, there is panic among the masses. Social media posts have touted many home remedies, including drinking apple cider vinegar, against COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that consuming apple cider vinegar may prevent or treat COVID-19 infections. The only way to curb the spread of this virus is by taking all the required precautions like wearing a mask at public places, washing hands with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer frequently, maintaining a physical distance of at least 6 feet. While eating a balanced diet helps build immunity, consuming specific products to boost immunity does not really help. Consuming large quantities of Apple Cider Vinegar can have its own side effects too."

Evidence:"These products may work to kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but they also may not. I am an environmental engineer and expert in UV disinfection. In May 2021, my colleagues and I set out to accurately test various UV systems and see which was the most effective at killing off – or inactivating – SARS-CoV-2. When UV light enters a cell, it breaks the bonds that hold DNA or RNA together. Light is categorized by wavelength – the distance between peaks of a wave of light – and is measured in nanometers."

Evidence:"Researchers assessed the effects of oseltamavir treatment among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Oseltamivir treatment was associated with a decreased rate of mortality and a shorter length of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 infection, according to findings published in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center between February and April 2020 and included 285 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients were assigned to 2 treatment groups on the basis of hospital admission date. Patients in group 1 (n=120) received oseltamivir plus standard care and those in group 2 (n=165; controls) received standard care with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The primary endpoints were length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit admission (ICU) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Using specialists and researchers to fact-check and verify stories, the Dakar-based website has published around fifty articles relating COVID-19. In the absence of effective treatments for the disease, articles and messages about purported miracle cures have proliferated. Following research and claims by a French physician infectious diseases specialist, Didier Raoult, on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19, information spread through WhatsApp and Twitter in several West African countries that the leaves of the neem tree contained chloroquine. This sparked a mad rush for these leaves. However, the quinine derivative does not come from a plant, but is obtained through chemical synthesis. Similarly, black tea, pepper soup, vitamin C, and garlic have also been put forward on social media as foods that help prevent or cure the disease."
Question:Can burning neem leaves treat COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"However, while there is no evidence that drinking alcohol affects the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine or causes any unwanted health effects, some doctors advise against drinking alcohol 48-72 hours after vaccination as this is the usual period one might expect common and usually mild after-effects of vaccination like fatigue, muscle aches, injection site pain, and the like.How can I ensure I’m drinking responsibly?While there are general guidelines applicable to most people, it’s important that you listen to your own body first and foremost.Always remember that ultimately, alcohol isn’t good even for completely healthy people. If you already have GI issues, abstaining entirely is best.If you choose not to abstain, keep your drinking to a minimum. Track your standardized drinks, and try not to exceed one per hour.For every alcoholic beverage you have, drink a glass of water to match it. Staying hydrated helps dilute the alcohol content and ease some of the irritating effects on your stomach.Be sure to eat something before (and during) your consumption, to slow the absorption of alcohol and allow your body to process it more efficiently (CDHF, n.d.).During these strange pandemic times, it’s more important than ever to be mindful of your alcohol consumption.

While the world has celebrated the arrival of highly effective vaccines against COVID-19, new work by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Oxford shows that even unrelated vaccines could help reduce the burden of the pandemic. The study, published Jan. 10 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, crystallizes decades of evidence suggesting that the generalized immune-boosting properties of many vaccines can cross-protect patients against multiple pathogens.Before COVID-19-specific vaccines became available, many public health experts and immunologists suggested immunizing vulnerable populations with other vaccines to provide some degree of protection. "We know that unrelated vaccines have these heterologous effects, and a reasonable person could tell you that if you used them during a pandemic, it would benefit," said Dr. Nathaniel Hupert, an associate professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and lead author on the new paper. However, it wasn't clear how much such an intervention would help, which populations would be best to target or how much of the population would have to get the unrelated vaccines to have a meaningful effect.To address those questions, Dr. Hupert and senior author Dr. Douglas Nixon, a professor of immunology in medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine, and their colleagues from Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Oxford used the COVID-19 International Modeling Consortium (CoMo) system, a sophisticated computer modeling platform they'd built in response to the pandemic. "If you have a model that can be customized to a particular place and time in the context of an outbreak, you can start to experiment with different conditions of population immunity and see how things might have played out," Dr. Hupert said.Using the winter 2020-21 COVID-19 wave that struck the United States after holiday season reopenings, the investigators modeled the likely effects of a non-COVID-19 vaccine intervention at different times and targeting different populations."

Evidence:"Is it really the case?In 2020, researchers suggested that smoking could protect against severe forms of COVID-19 and many media outlets picked up on the information. Since then, the main paper that assumed a protective effect of smoking against COVID-19 has been depublished due to undeclared links of interest between some of the authors and the tobacco industry. So, does smoking really protect against COVID-19? What would be the links between smoking and coronavirus infection? The still unclear links between smoking, coronavirus infection and ACE-2 receptors
Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV2 which plunged the world into an unprecedented global crisis, enter the body mainly by binding to a cell surface protein: ACE-2 receptors. These components are involved in pulmonary and cardiovascular function, through the production of a substance that dilates blood vessels: angiotensin 1-7."

Evidence:"[ SEE:  The Latest Coronavirus News ]The research that she worked on, which was published in July, did not find a relationship between blood type and severe cases of COVID-19. "People are getting confused about, 'Oh, if I get [COVID-19] and I'm type A blood I'm going to die,' and that's untrue," Dua says. "But whether or not if you're type A blood you're more likely to get it, that's another question. "But at the same time, Dua notes that data available on the subject of COVID-19 and blood type are conflicted. For example, a small study out of Canada in October found that patients with blood type A or AB are at increased risk for requiring ventilation compared to those with blood type O or B.Photos: America's Pandemic TollView All 38 ImagesThe study Dua was involved in also found that people with blood type O were less likely to test positive for the coronavirus than other blood types.

                          Early epidemiologic studies documented lower rates of active smokers compared to former or non-smokers in symptomatic patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was hypothesized that nicotine may interact with SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by downregulating the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and might mitigate the inflammatory response induced by the virus through activation of the nicotinic cholinergic system. This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of nicotine administered by a transdermal patch in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. The results show that transdermal nicotine did not significantly reduce day-28 mortality. 60-Day mortality, time to successful extubation, days alive and free from mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressor support or organ failure were also not modified by nicotine. IntroductionThe world population remains at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially with the emergence of genetic variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with increase in transmissibility, potential for more severe disease and significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination [1, 2]."

Evidence:"Dr. Huang: Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, also called monoclonal antibody infusion treatment, is a way of treating COVID-19. The goal of this therapy is to help prevent hospitalizations, reduce viral loads and lessen symptom severity. This type of therapy relies on monoclonal antibodies. These are antibodies that are similar to the ones your body would naturally make in response to infection. However, monoclonal antibodies are mass-produced in a laboratory and are designed to recognize a specific component of this virus — the spike protein on its outer shell. By targeting the spike protein, these specific antibodies interfere with the virus' ability to attach and gain entry into human cells."

Evidence:"This knowledge also paves the way for questions as to whether we could use breast milk to treat or prevent COVID-19. Some of the health benefits of breast milk are already harnessed in various ways. Through human breast milk banks, for example, donated breast milk is used to save the lives of premature and sick babies. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 breast milk antibodies to neutralise the virus is retained after high pressure pasteurization, which is a good sign. If we were to consider using SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk to treat COVID-19, such an approach would be similar to that of convalescent plasma therapy. This is where antibodies from the blood of people who have had COVID-19 are administered to hospital patients with the virus to limit disease severity – although these trials have not been very successful."

DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2021 — A high dose of a purified omega-3 fatty acid, available by prescription only, was well tolerated; however, it did not substantially reduce incidents of hospitalizations and/or deaths among people with COVID-19, according to a late-breaking clinical trial presented today at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2021. The meeting is fully virtual, Saturday, November 13-Monday, November 15, 2021, and is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science for health care worldwide. Researchers sought to determine whether a high dose of pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester, called icosapent ethyl (IPE), would reduce the rate of hospitalizations and/or death among people with COVID-19. The Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With EPA in Subjects at Risk - Intervention Trial (PREPARE-IT 2) included approximately 2,000 men and women, ages 40 and older, who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced symptoms of the infection (fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or muscle aches) for 7 days or less prior to study enrollment but did not clearly require hospitalization. Participants were randomized to receive either IPE or placebo pills.

Evidence:"Despite the high prevalence of the disease, it has currently no definitive treatment. We here reported the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in severely ill COVID-19 patients diagnosed based on PCR and radiology tests. CASE PRESENTATION Five severely ill COVID-19 patients in whom standard treatments failed were administrated with IVIG which prevented the deterioration of clinical symptoms. All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3-0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3-0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed."

An expanded access protocol (EAP) has been initiated in the US for compassionate use of remestemcel-L in the treatment of COVID-19 infected children with cardiovascular and other complications of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).Mesoblast Limited, announced that patients aged between two months and 17 years may receive one to two doses of its mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) candidate remestemcel-L, currently being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19, within five days of referral under the EAP.The protocol filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides physicians with access to remestemcel-L for an intermediate-size patient population under Mesoblast’s existing Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The FDA states the EAP is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease or condition to gain access to an investigational medical product for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available.Experimental stem cell therapy trial for COVID-19 initiated…MIS-C is a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 in otherwise healthy children and adolescents that includes massive simultaneous inflammation of multiple critical organs and their vasculature. In approximately 50 percent of cases this inflammation is associated with significant cardiovascular complications that directly involve heart muscle and may result in decreased cardiac function. In addition, the virus can result in dilation of coronary arteries with unknown future consequences.Mesoblast Chief Medical Officer, Dr Fred Grossman said: “The extensive body of safety and efficacy data generated to date using remestemcel-L in children with graft versus host disease suggest that our cellular therapy could provide a clinically important therapeutic benefit in MIS-C patients, especially if the heart is involved as a target organ for inflammation. Use of remestemcel-L in children with COVID-19 builds on and extends the potential application of this cell therapy in COVID-19 cytokine storm beyond the most severe adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome.”Remestemcel-LRemestemcel-L is an investigational therapy comprising culture-expanded MSCs derived from the bone marrow of an unrelated donor and is administered in a series of intravenous infusions."

But does that mean the buzzing insects also carry and spread the coronavirus that causes COVID-19? Ahead, an expert sets the record straight.Can mosquitoes carry or spread COVID-19?Good news: There is currently no evidence that mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The novel coronavirus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, which are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Blood doesn’t really factor into that equation, and no cases of COVID-19 originating from mosquitoes have been reported so far.Related StoryHere’s Why Mosquitoes Really “Love” You“Mosquitoes don’t transmit everything; they transmit a certain, relatively small number of diseases,” explains Stephen Gluckman, M.D., an infectious disease expert and medical director of Penn Global Medicine. “That has to do with the ability of that disease to live in the mosquito.”In order to spread from a mosquito to a person, a virus must be compatible with both human and insect bodies."

AbstractIntroduction SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is effective in preventing severe COVID-19, but efficacy in reducing viral load and transmission wanes over time. In addition, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS-CoV-2 infections.Methods 120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 18 – 75 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention."

The government has also suggested a five-step sample meal plan for those recovering from the disease. It has been said that the plan will boost immunity and help people recover from post virus fatigue. Recently, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the myth that claimed that pouring two drops of lemon juice in the nose could completely kill Covid-19 in the body. Bolo Indya, the made-in-India live streaming platform has come together with MyGov India to launch a mass awareness program for users living in tier 2, 3, and 4 cities of the nation. The partnership is aimed at aiding the Centre’s efforts in fighting the coronavirus crisis."
