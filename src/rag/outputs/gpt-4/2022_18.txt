Evidence:"Black tea bag
The black tea leaves contain tannic acid, which is a coagulant. Hence, placing the tea bag over the area of bleeding will speed up the blood clotting. Besides, the teabag must be wet as a dry one is of no use. Rest and take a break
After the surgery or extraction, rest for some hours as it is necessary to prepare your body for the next task. Bleeding might increase if you exercise or do strenuous activity, so avoid it for a few days until the area returns to normal. Take care while eating and drinking
Few hours after the procedure, once the effect of sedations starts reducing, the person might feel hungry."

Results from the largest international study on cell phones and cancer was released in 2010. It showed participants in the study who used a cell phone for 10 years or more had doubled the rate of brain glioma, a type of tumor. To date, there have been no long-term studies on the effects of cell phone usage among children. "Children's skulls and scalps are thinner.

Evidence:"The aim of this literature review is to assess whether squats with less knee flexion (half/quarter squats) are safer on the musculoskeletal system than deep squats. A search of relevant scientific publications was conducted between March 2011 and January 2013 using PubMed. Over 164 articles were included in the review. There are no realistic estimations of knee-joint forces for knee-flexion angles beyond 50° in the deep squat. Based on biomechanical calculations and measurements of cadaver knee joints, the highest retropatellar compressive forces and stresses can be seen at 90°. With increasing flexion, the wrapping effect contributes to an enhanced load distribution and enhanced force transfer with lower retropatellar compressive forces."

Evidence:"Consequences of morphine addiction
Morphine addiction occurs after a chemical dependence has formed — although not everyone with morphine dependence will go on to develop addiction. Abusing morphine recreationally, such as by snorting, smoking, or injecting the drug, increases the risk of addiction and overdose. Addiction to morphine involves compulsive use of the drug that leads to numerous consequences, impacting physical, mental and behavioral aspects of one’s life. Once addicted to it, the individual will experience harsh withdrawal effects when the morphine wears off. These include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Stomach cramps
Chills
Excessive yawning
Excessive tearing of the eyes
Dizziness
Sweating
Loss of appetite
Muscle aches
Irritability
Restlessness
Depression
Anxiety
Rapid breathing
Brain fog
Withdrawal symptoms are the result of the changes that morphine has caused in the brain. The brain has become accustomed to the drug and, in its absence, will cause these signs of destabilization."

A recent study from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS) and FARI sheds new light on this question. The investigators utilized data from 9253 healthy men and women who had at least two preventive medical examinations at Cooper Clinic in Dallas over a 10-year period.

Pregnant women may be exposed to MRI contrast agent
 Aug 20, 2019
By Carolyn Crist
(Reuters Health) – Women who don’t realize they’re pregnant when they undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be exposed to a chemical that might not be safe for the fetus, a new report warns. The chemical, a dye called gadolinium contrast media, is used in about 30% to 45% of MRI scans in the U.S. to help enhance differences in internal organs, soft tissues, blood vessels, and bones. “It is known that gadolinium contrast crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation,” said lead study author Steven Bird of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The safety of gadolinium-based contrast agents, or GBCAs, in pregnant women “has not been established, and their use during pregnancy is not recommended unless essential to the health of the woman or fetus,” Bird told Reuters Health by email. “Available data from cohort studies and case reports have revealed inconsistent findings regarding the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes.”
Bird and colleagues used the FDA-funded Sentinel Distributed Database to analyze data from nearly 4.7 million pregnancies in that resulted in live births between 2006 and 2017."

Evidence:"But before you begin any exercise programme, do see your general physician for a complete health check-up.Consider trying a combination of these forms of exercises to improve your cholesterol status:Aerobic activities: These are heart-pumping activities such as jogging, jumping rope, biking and swimming.Strength-training routines: These are muscle-building exercises like squats, push-ups and lunges.Flexibility exercises: These are an integral part of all good exercise programmes and should be done after each workout.The key to controlling your cholesterol is to maintain the intensity of the exercise.You can vary your exercise routine, for instance, changing the activity done in the aerobic / cardiovascular component from jogging to skipping rope. Or you can change the resistance / strengthening activity from weight training to calisthenics. But the intensity should be kept the same to have an effect on your cholesterol levels.Sometimes having a variety of activities in an exercise programme helps in adherence but it is not necessary. It ultimately depends on the natural inclination of the individual.Other health benefits of exerciseBesides improving your cholesterol numbers, the overall health benefits of exercise are immense.When you exercise, you are also getting many other cardiovascular benefits, like a lower blood pressure and a diminished risk of heart attack and stroke. Exercise has also been shown to contribute to a lower risk of cancer. Of course, it also promotes weight loss as well as an overall sense of well-being.Be sure to heed your doctor’s advice concerning exercise and cholesterol management, and take your prescribed medication regularly.Ref: ​​​​​T12

Participants who chewed minty gum before eating didn't consume fewer calories; but they did eat a lot less fruit.By Lindsay AbramsMarch 25, 2013Sharemahalie/FlickrAs sugar-free gum contains next to no calories, and chewing it precludes one's ability to simultaneously eat food, and maybe it even burns calories (11 per hour, says the Internet), it could seem like a perfect, minty-fresh tool for losing weight. Some research has even suggested that it might act as an appetite suppressant.

Evidence:"In addition to these observations of AIDS in SIVcpz-related infections, there is one case documenting that chimpanzees can develop AIDS after experimental infection with HIV-1 [45]. This chimpanzee of West-African origin was infected with three different HIV-1 isolates. The animal eventually developed AIDS, and subsequent analysis showed that a recombinant HIV-1 strain had emerged. Three other chimpanzees that were afterwards infected with this recombinant strain all developed signs of AIDS-like disease [46]. This set of experiments shows that viruses that have been edited in the human population, and that are re-introduced into their original host species, can cause AIDS. Thus, escape from immune control in chimpanzees is possible in exceptional cases, even within a species considered to be relatively resistant.Control of AIDS development in humans: an introduction to the MHCIn HIV-1-infected human cohorts, certain individuals do not progress towards AIDS."

Evidence:"In some rare cases, excessive water consumption can even be harmful. “In athletes or people who are exercising for hours, if they’re only drinking water, they can throw out too much sodium in their urine, which leads to an imbalance in the body’s sodium levels,” explains Nieman, who has spent a chunk of his career investigating exercise-related hydration. Doctors call this imbalance “hyponatremia,” and in some cases it can be deadly. In this scenario, sports drinks and other beverages that contain nutrients and sodium are safer than plain water. While hyponatremia and excessive water consumption aren’t big concerns for non-athletes, there are better ways to keep the body and brain hydrated than to pound water all day long. Sipping water (or any other beverage) a little bit at a time prevents the kidneys from being “overloaded,” and so helps the body retain more H2O, Nieman says."
Question:Is too much water bad for you?

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is the virus which, when untreated, becomes AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The virus attacks the body's immune system, especially white blood cells called CD-4 cells (also called "T-cells"). Your immune system is what fights against infections to keep your body healthy and T-cells play a key role in keeping a person protected from infections. If your immune system is weakened, it can't protect your body and you can easily get sick. AIDS/HIV:
can be spread from mother to unborn baby, but the risk of passing the virus to your baby can be reduced
cannot be transferred through sweat, saliva or casual contact with someone who is infected
could take years to show symptoms, but internal damage is still happening
has no cure, but treatments help prevent the disease from getting worse

Evidence:"This has led people to believe that you can’t get pregnant while breastfeeding because you’re not having a period. However, this is not universally true for all women and should not be relied upon as a reliable method of contraception. When breastfeeding can act as birth control: the LAM method
One form of natural contraception brought about by breastfeeding is the lactational amenorrhea method, or LAM. (Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation.) This method is grounded in the scientific belief that exclusive breastfeeding suppresses a woman’s fertility, thereby preventing pregnancy. LAM can be a very effective family planning method as long as certain conditions are met:
the woman’s period has not returned since she gave birth
the baby is exclusively breastfeeding on demand and is not eating any other foods or liquids
the baby is less than 6 months old
If the mother and baby meet all of these conditions, the chance of pregnancy is very low (less than 2%, according to World Alliance for Breastfeeding)."

Evidence:"Vitamin C supplements won’t treat or prevent colds. Kokopinto
When used as a treatment for cold symptoms in the general population, vitamin C supplements appear to do no better than a placebo, even in large doses (greater than one gram a day). If you take vitamin C supplements every day for prevention, you still won’t avoid any colds. But the symptoms may be milder and the duration of symptoms slightly reduced – about half a day for a typical cold lasting a week. It’s important to remember that we don’t know if regular high-dose vitamin C supplements are entirely safe when taken over the long-term. There is some evidence to suggest they aren’t."

Evidence:"Here's What We Know
                        January 31, 2019
 by  Melissa Willets
There's no doubt that there are benefits to drinking lemon water. The citrus fruit is packed with antioxidants like vitamin C, "which remove potentially damaging oxidizing agents from the body, decreasing or preventing their ability to cause further havoc," according to Gabrielle Mancella, a registered dietitian at Orlando Health. But while lemons can help ward off illness and keep your skin healthy, you shouldn't count on them to target stubborn belly fat. "There is no 'spot cleaning' when it comes to weight loss," Gabrielle told POPSUGAR."
Question:Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?

Evidence:"Now they're spreading to the front and other places on my body. They get painfully snagged, are unsightly, and it's affecting my life. Answer:
The tendency to develop skin tags is a genetic one. Family members will often recall that their parents or grandparents were bothered by tags as well. It is possible that the high levels of estrogen that occur during pregnancy can make tags grow faster and more in number. This is the same reason that some moles and blood vessel growths get larger during pregnancy."

GeneralThere is currently a lot of information online and in health magazines about the oral health benefits of “oil pulling”.“Oil pulling” involves swishing your mouth out with some type of edible oil (usually coconut or sesame oil).The technique is similar to how you would ordinarily use mouthwash; however with oil pulling it’s recommended that you swish the oil in your mouth for up to 5 to 20 minutes.Seems like a lot of time and effort, doesn’t it?Proponents of oil pulling claim that it has the following benefits to your oral health:Oil pulling can prevent tooth decay and cavities.It can fight gingivitis (help look after your gums).It can whiten your teeth.It can reduce bad breath.List of claimed benefits of oil pulling according to DrJockers.comNaturally, big claims require big evidence, so let’s take a look at how far we can actually say that oil pulling can have any of these oral health benefits.1) Oil pulling can prevent cavities.Those who say that that oil pulling can help prevent cavities and tooth decay claim that the oil can kill the harmful plaque bacteria that cause these problems.There actually have been a couple of clinical studies on this.Both studies suggested that oil pulling can reduce the amount of harmful bacteria in someone’s mouth, and that the extent to which it can do this is similar to regular mouthwash.Both of the studies claim that the active, anti-bacterial ingredient in the oils is lauric acid.The oil with the highest quantities of lauric acid is coconut oil.Therefore coconut oil is the best oil to use for oil pulling, as far as preventing tooth decay is concerned.Despite this, it is also very important to remember that the mechanical removal of bacteria is far more effective than trying to kill the bacteria with chemicals.This means that brushing is far more important in preventing tooth decay and cavities than any type of mouthwash (oil or otherwise) will ever be.Dentist’s verdict: Oil pulling can complement daily brushing to help prevent tooth decay, but it certainly is not essential and definitely should not be seen as the most important factor in preventing cavities. If you are to use oil pulling for this purpose, you should use coconut oil as it has high concentrations of lauric acid, which is the ingredient that actually reduces the amount of harmful bacteria in your mouth.2) Oil pulling can fight gingivitis and protect you from gum disease.Gingivitis is caused by plaque bacteria getting under the gum line.This is supported by the same theory that underlies the claim that oil pulling can help fight against tooth decay.Proponents of oil pulling argue that when you swish your mouth out with oil, it can get underneath your gum line and reduce the amount of inflammation-causing bacteria in contact with your gums.Again, there are a very small number of clinical studies supporting this.The active ingredient in the oil with regards to fighting gingivitis is, again, lauric acid.Therefore, the best oil to use for oil pulling (as far as looking after your gums is concerned) is coconut oil.Once more, it is important to stress that the bacteria that causes gum inflammation is far less resistant to mechanical, rather than chemical cleaning.Therefore oil pulling should not be seen as an alternative to flossing, rather it should complement regular flossing.Additionally, if you have symptoms of gum disease such as receding gums, or gums that regularly bleed during brushing, it is best to see a dentist or periodontist about this.Dentist’s verdict: Oil pulling with coconut oil can help with more mild forms of gingivitis when used in conjunction with flossing. This is (again) due to the lauric acid in coconut oil. It should not be seen as a way of treating more serious gum disease or as a replacement of flossing.3) Oil pulling can whiten your teeth.Most of the “evidence” for the ability of oil pulling to whiten your teeth comes from “before and after” shots of people’s teeth along with the claim that these results were achieved by oil pulling.Before and after photo of 49 day oil pulling treatment. Taken from this video.The above photo is an example of this.Please note that the video that this comes from is trying to sell oil pulling products…so make of that what you will.The best way to measure how far oil pulling can whiten your teeth is through clinically controlled studies comparing the changes in tooth shade of a group of people who do oil pulling against a group of people who do not.All other variables that may affect tooth shade, such as what people eat and drink, their other oral hygiene habits, and even how they breathe when asleep, need to be controlled.Currently, no such clinical study exists, so we will have to make do with evaluating the mechanism to which oil pulling can (apparently) whiten your teeth.Tooth stains can be broadly categorised into three groups:1) Extrinsic stains: these are stains to the outer surface of your tooth (enamel) usually caused by certain foods, drinks and smoking.2) Intrinsic stains: these are stains of the dentin, a tissue which lies below the enamel. This is usually caused by trauma.3) Age related stains: as you age enamel thins and dentin naturally darkens, the combination of this leads to darkened teeth as you get older.Now as oil pulling involves bathing the outer layer of your teeth in oil, it could only possibly fight extrinsic staining.The only possible way that oil pulling can lift these stains is if the stains are “fat-soluble”.If this is the case, then extended contact with oil may dissolve some of the stains off your teeth.So is there any evidence that extrinsic tooth stains are “fat-soluble”?Well let’s use the example of three common substances that cause extrinsic tooth staining: red wine, coffee and tobacco.In coffee and wine, the staining substance is tannin."
Question:Can oil pulling heal cavities?

no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"About half of the adults who are over 50 will have to deal with hemorrhoids at some time. Whether you want to try to prevent hemorrhoids, or are treating them, eating high fiber foods can make a difference. How can changing your diet help with hemorrhoid symptoms? For many people, eating more low fat, high fiber, and whole-grain foods helps prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids. Eating more fiber can provide several benefits including:
Increasing stool weight helps reduce the time it spends in the colon
Fiber increases water retention in the colon which results in softer stools that are easier to pass
It also decreases the pH levels in the colon which helps pass foods through the colon more quickly
How much fiber do you need? Check with your primary care physician or a nutritionist to be sure you are getting adequate amounts."
Question:Does a high fiber diet help with hemorrhoids?
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"From 2008 to 2012, the number of drugs known to potentially interact with grapefruit, with risk of harmful or even dangerous effects (gastrointestinal bleeding, nephrotoxicity), increased from 17 to 43. [1]
Traits[edit]
The interaction between citrus and medication depends on the individual drug, and not the class of the drug. Drugs that interact usually share three common features: they are taken orally, normally only a small amount enters systemic blood circulation, and they are metabolized by CYP3A4. [1] However, the effects on the CYP3A4 in the liver could in principle cause interactions with non-oral drugs,[citation needed] and non-CYP3A4-mediated effects also exist. [29]
Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components include CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. [21] Drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes may have interactions with components of grapefruit."

Evidence:"Kind of – that’s the short answer. If you’re vaping nicotine, you’re still upping your chances of heart attack and stroke, but if your vaping helps you stop smoking tobacco, you’re decreasing your chances of cancer, lung disease, and all sorts of other nasty effects of smoking. As far as we know, high-quality vape juice, used with a well-designed, high-end vape pen or mod, is safe. If the user is vaping nicotine, they’re better off than if they were smoking. Is vaping without nicotine bad for you? Not at all – without any drug in the vape juice, you’re just inhaling vaporized glycerin and flavorings."
Question:Can vape pens be harmful?

yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A 2019 study found that vitamin C may significantly decrease post-meal blood glucose levels.ManganeseBananas are also a source of manganese, a trace mineral that is involved in bone formation, reproduction, immune system response, and blood clotting. Manganese also has antioxidant action.Deficiency in this mineral may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and bone problems. The recommended daily intake of manganese is 1.8 milligrams for women and 2.3 milligrams for men. One banana contains 0.26 milligrams of this mineral.Resistant StarchUnripe bananas and plantains contain resistant starch, which is a type of starch that isn’t digested by the body. This compound works similarly to fiber and may lead to improved bowel health, improved glycemic and insulin response.It may also have health benefits including helping to lower cholesterol and increasing fullness after meals (which has been observed in overweight men).Bananas and Blood GlucoseOne ripe, medium-sized banana contains about 18 grams of sugar and 26 grams of carbs. While it’s possible for this amount of sugar to have a significant impact on your blood sugar, the exact effect may vary depending on your individual body and your overall diet.The glycemic index, or GI scale, is a tool that can sometimes help determine how quickly sugar from a food will enter your bloodstream and lead to blood sugar spikes."
