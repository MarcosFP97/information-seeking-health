Evidence:"If the bleeding starts again, prepare another tea bag. To prevent continuous bleeding, instruct your young patient to be careful with the blood clots in the sockets. Blood clots can be displaced by strenuous activities, such as drinking through straws, or excessive spitting, which can worsen bleeding. They shouldn’t even use a toothbrush for the first day of their recovery, since brushing can upset the blood clot. After 24 hours, they can softly brush their teeth, removing bacteria from teeth, tongue, and gums. How the Wisdom Teeth Tea Bag Remedy Works

Evidence:"“I am not aware of any [National Science Foundation]-supported studies into the healing powers of crystals,” Peter Heaney, a mineral sciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, said via email. “Such a proposal would frankly never survive peer review, because there is not any theoretical reason to expect crystals to have healing powers.”AdvertisementHeaney recounted a story from his days as a graduate student, when his adviser was asked whether crystals have energy. “It is a tricky question,” Heaney wrote, “because the answer is ‘yes’ with respect to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence (e=mc^2) or with respect to thermodynamic conceptions of free energy in crystals. But as my advisor noted, crystal healing posits that there is an energy transfer between crystals and people . . . and there is simply no scientific foundation for those assertions.”Mineralogist Jeff Post, the Smithsonian Institution’s curator-in-charge of gems and minerals, said in an email: “The simple fact is that there is no scientific basis for any kind of crystal healing. No doubt, beautiful crystals can bring joy and some happiness just by looking at them, like looking at beautiful art or beautiful flowers, but I think that is the extent of their power.”Stuart Vyse, behavioral scientist and author of “Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition,” said “there is no evidence that there’s a mechanism by which [crystals] could heal that’s understood by science."

Evidence:"BERKELEY, Calif. - New UC Berkeley research draws a strong link between cell phone radiation and tumors, particularly in the brain. Researchers took a comprehensive look at statistical findings from 46 different studies around the globe and found that the use of a cell phone for more than 1,000 hours, or about 17 minutes a day over a ten year period, increased the risk of tumors by 60 percent. Researchers also pointed to findings that showed cell phone use for 10 or more years doubled the risk of brain tumors. Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health conducted the research in partnership with Korea’s National Cancer Center, and Seoul National University. Their analysis took a comprehensive look at statistical findings from case control studies from 16 countries including the U.S., Sweden, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand. "Cell phone use highlights a host of public health issues and it has received little attention in the scientific community, unfortunately," said Moskowitz."

Evidence:"But few can be as bizarre as the claims made by builders Simon and Andy, who say that industrial lubricant WD-40 can help cure arthritis and ease a congested chest. The duo made their odd claim on Channel 4 documentary series Health Freaks, which offers people with a home remedy they swear by the chance to have it checked over by a panel of doctors. Currently, more than 10 million people suffer from arthritis in the UK alone, and the cost to the NHS runs into millions. Andy, who suffers from the condition, said: ‘I went to the doctor and he prescribed me paracetamol for my arthritis. Asked if he was worried about any potentially toxic side-effects of using WD-40, Andy added: ‘No, I’m not worried about toxins. If you do your research, you’ll see there are fish oils in WD-40.’

you're worried about a bite or sting 
your symptoms do not start to improve within a few days or are getting worse 
you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes 
a large area (around 10cm or more patch of skin) around the bite becomes red and swollen 
you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness 
you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a high temperature, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms
When to get emergency medical help
Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as:
wheezing or difficulty breathing 
a swollen face, mouth or throat 
feeling sick or being sick
a fast heart rate 
dizziness or feeling faint 
difficulty swallowing
loss of consciousness 
Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings
There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should:
remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees – don't wave your arms around or swat at them 
cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers 
wear shoes when outdoors 
apply insect repellent to exposed skin – repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective 
avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants – these can attract insects 
be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served 
You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about preventing insect bites and stings."

That allows chemotherapy and other treatments to find and destroy cancer cells or, as Dang puts it, “bring them out into daylight, so you can see them and target them.”
While this isn’t the first time that baking soda has been investigated as a potential aid to cancer therapy, it’s the first study to reveal how and why it’s able to help. “The excitement here is this very simple concept that has been around for a while now has some mechanism behind it,” Dang said. The next step is studying whether the approach actually succeeds in making cancer therapies more effective. Until then, he said, patients should hold off on any DIY experiments."

Evidence:"Or at least, it needs to come with some serious caveats. Are Deep Squats Bad for Knees? “It’s been a fearmongering tactic that came out from these studies in the ‘50s and ‘60s that made everyone scared you’d tear your ACL, but that’s not the case,” says Dr. Aaron Horschig, a sports and orthopedic physical therapist, Olympic weightlifter, and founder of Squat University. “The ligaments are very safe, they’re not placed on that much of a stretch in deep squat — they’re actually loaded much earlier in the squat motion.”
Research agrees that forces inside the ACL and PCL (two major ligaments in the knee) decrease the more the knee is bent. Theoretically, if there were an issue, it’d be with pressure on the meniscus or the patellar, because those two areas have more contact the deeper the squats go. Some folks argue that lots of deep squats lead to early onset of arthritis because, theoretically, they would gradually wear away the smooth underlining of the cartilage or the meniscus."

Evidence:"For arthritis and joint pain specifically, the benefit of using magnetic bracelets for pain management are due to the magnetic field encouraging any impaired cells that are causing inflammation to heal themselves. Furthermore, the improved circulation will encourage more oxygen and nutrients to the area to further aid the healing process. This is a non-invasive way of helping organic healing in the body as opposed to taking medication which could have unexpected side effects. The flexibility of magnetic bracelets for joint pain can allow them to be used as the sole method of pain relief for many, or in conjunction with other therapies and techniques.Static magnets can be applied to specific areas that are causing discomfort such as knee joints or backs, similar to a magnetic knee support, and can be included in other items such as shoes and mattresses to provide whole body relief. For bracelets specifically, they can be made from titanium or copper which have their own additional health benefits.With conditions like arthritis and joint problems, it is vital that the sufferer continues to move and exercise so the joints do not further stiffen. This can be a painful process if the area is already inflamed, however by using an arthritis bracelet, this exercise can be a much less painful activity as direct relief is being continuously provided."

Evidence:"Researchers are not only arguing over whether sit-ups do you any good – but whether they might even be bad for you. Do they give you a taut six-pack across your abdomen or does a flat stomach depend more on diet and general exercise than a specific routine?

But to get the desired six-pack does take an awful lot of work. In a small randomised controlled trial in Illinois in 2011 one group did daily abdominal exercises while the lucky control group did none.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"When a person living with HIV is taking HIV drugs and their viral load has stayed at undetectable levels (not enough HIV in their bloodstream for a test to measure), that person cannot sexually transmit HIV to a partner. This is called treatment as prevention, and is often represented in the HIV community by the simple phrase “undetectable equals untransmittable,” or "U=U." For more information on this development, see our fact sheet Undetectable Equals Untransmittable: Building Hope and Ending HIV Stigma. HIV is also spread through contact with the body fluids below. However, usually only health care workers come into contact with these fluids. They are:
Cerebrospinal fluid around the brain and spinal cord
Synovial fluid around the joints
Amniotic fluid around a developing fetus (or baby in the womb)
HIV is not spread through contact with these body fluids:
Sweat
Tears
Saliva (spit)
Feces (poop)
Urine (pee)
In other words, you cannot get HIV by touching or hugging someone who is living with HIV, kissing someone living with HIV, drinking or eating from the same cups or utensils as a person living with HIV, or by using a toilet also used by someone living with HIV."
Question:Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"Complicating matters further is the fact that many products or treatments that may help some people feel more relaxed—in the name of self-care—are often marketed as having definitive health benefits. In these situations, it's up to the consumer to make an informed purchase, understanding exactly what a particular wellness product or trend can—and can't—do. Salt lamps (sometimes referred to as Himalayan salt lamps) are a perfect example of a wellness product with a controversial reputation. While it's one thing to enjoy a salt lamp's soft pink glow in your home, believing that they posses healing properties—or taking it a step further and attempting to use it as a treatment for a medical condition—is something else entirely. Here's what to know about what salt lamps can actually do—versus what medical marketing claims they can do."
Question:Do Himalayan salt lamps have health benefits?
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"While exclusive breastfeeding can temporarily delay your fertility postpartum, making it more difficult to conceive while nursing, it's not impossible. With that in mind, the short answer is yes, you can get pregnant while breastfeeding. That said, it's a little more complicated than that! Breastfeeding and Fertility
While it's true that breastfeeding can delay the return of your fertility postpartum, it's not impossible to get pregnant. The time it takes for a woman's period to return after giving birth can vary widely. Once you start menstruating, it is usually a sign that your fertility has returned or will return soon."

Evidence:"Some people also believe getting lots of vitamin C can help you avoid colds, or quickly cure cold symptoms when they arise. According to the NHS, there’s not enough evidence to show that vitamin C is an effective treatment for the common cold. However, we do know that a severe deficiency can make it harder for our bodies to fight off infection. This means that, over time, not getting enough vitamin C may increase your risk of getting sick. Regardless, there are many benefits to having a good vitamin C intake, which is why it’s important to try and get the recommended amount each day. How much vitamin C do I need to stay healthy?"

Evidence:"While the current scientific thinking on the topic is anything but settled, there's some evidence that coffee might be helpful for dieters. (Getty Images)There's been such enthusiastic support for some of the early findings of studies about coffee's role in weight loss that there's now a diet plan called the coffee lover's diet, which is laid out in a book of the same name by Dr. Bob Arnot, a physician and bestselling author of numerous diet and wellness books. That diet encourages drinking at least three cups of light-roast coffee per day, while restricting calories with an eating plan that looks a bit like the Mediterranean diet to lose weight.Other high-profile celebrity diet gurus have also recently pushed green coffee bean extract, a pill-based supplement, to help people lose weight. A 2017 study conducted in Iran found that women with obesity who took 400 milligrams per day of this supplement for eight weeks while following a low-calorie diet lost more weight than those on the same diet who did not take the extract. The extract comes from unroasted green coffee beans and contains caffeine and other components of coffee that may promote weight loss. The use of this supplement has been deemed a fad by some nutritionists.However, there is something to the idea that coffee and its constituent components could help support weight loss.“There have been various studies looking at the effects of coffee consumption for weight loss,” says Katherine Mitchell, an oncology dietitian at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute in Columbus."

Red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork – is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, and can form part of a balanced diet. But eating a lot of red and processed meat increases your risk of bowel (colorectal) cancer.That's why it's recommended that people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day cut down to 70g or less. This could help reduce your risk of bowel cancer.Other healthier lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a healthy weight, keeping active and not smoking can also reduce your risk. Red meat and processed meatRed meat includes:beeflamb and muttonporkvealvenisongoatIt does not include:chickenturkeyduckgoosegame birdsrabbitProcessed meat is meat that's been preserved by smoking, curing, salting or adding preservatives. This includes:sausagesbaconhamdeli meats such as salamipâtéscanned meat such as corned beefsliced luncheon meats, including those made from chicken and turkey
Recommendations for red and processed meatAdultsIf you eat more than 90g of red or processed meat a day, it's recommended that you reduce your intake to 70g or less a day.You can do this by eating smaller portions of red and processed meat, eating these meats less often or swapping them for alternatives.If you eat more than 90g of red and processed meat on a certain day, you can eat less on the following days or have meat-free days so that the average amount you eat each day is no more than 70g.ChildrenChildren over 5 should eat a balanced diet, as shown in the proportions on the Eatwell Guide. This should include meat or other sources of protein."

Evidence:"They tend to occur in older people and people who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.Pregnant women may also be more likely to develop skin tags. This may be as a result of changes in their hormone levels. Some people develop them for no obvious reason.When skin tags can be a problemSkin tags are harmless and don't usually cause pain or discomfort. You may consider having skin tags removed if they're affecting your self-esteem, or if they snag on clothing or jewellery and bleed.You'll usually need to pay to have this done privately.This is because skin tag removal is regarded as cosmetic surgery, which is rarely available through the health service.Cosmetic surgery is usually only available on the health service if the problem is affecting your physical or mental health.Sometimes, skin tags fall off on their own if the tissue has twisted and died from a lack of blood supply.Removing skin tagsDon't try to remove a skin tag without speaking to your GP first. If you have a skin tag that's causing problems, take advice from your GP about where to go to have it removed.Surgical removal has the advantage of removing the skin tag completely, but there is a risk of minor bleeding.Never try to remove large skin tags yourself because they'll bleed heavily.The difference between a skin tag and a wartCompared with warts, skin tags are:smooth and soft (warts tend to be rougher with an irregular surface)knobbly and hang off the skin (warts are usually slightly raised or flat)not contagious (warts spread very easily, so a sudden outbreak or cluster of growths is more likely to be warts)Read more about warts

Evidence:"ConclusionOil pulling is observed to bring improvement in oral hygiene when practiced correctly and regularly. Limited available research on effect of oil pulling on oral hygiene shows promising benefits of oil pulling procedure on oral cavity. However oil pulling does not replace dental therapy and is currently not recommended by American dental association.35 Extensive research on the role of this traditional, cheap and valuable remedy should be encouraged without bias.

Evidence:"They’re loaded with both kinds of fiber but especially rich in the soluble type (8, 9).For instance, 1 cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils packs nearly 16 grams of fiber. That’s about half of the recommended fiber intake (10). Most adults should get 21–38 grams per day, though this may vary depending on your age and sex (11).Lentils and other legumes can bulk up your stool, making it less likely that you have to strain when going to the bathroom. This can help prevent hemorrhoids or ease symptoms (12).2. Whole grainsLike legumes, whole grains are nutritional powerhouses. That’s because they retain their germ, bran, and endosperm, which are loaded with beneficial components like fiber (7, 13).Whole grains are especially rich in insoluble fiber."

Evidence:"“While both groups lost weight, the apple cider vinegar group lost more. As with many prior studies, this one was quite small and short-term,” he says. HOW ACV HELPS IN WEIGHT LOSS
• Boosting metabolism: Studies have shown that ACV increases the enzyme AMPK which is responsible for this property.Advertisement
• Increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps in regulating blood sugar levels and thereby maintaining a healthy weight. Researchers suggest that taking ACV before a carbohydrate containing meal can increase insulin sensitivity. When you have better insulin sensitivity, you’re less likely to accumulate belly fat or visceral fat. However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional to advise you on the dosage of ACV if you are on any diabetic medications."
