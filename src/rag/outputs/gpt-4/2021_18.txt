Evidence:"The children received oral paracetamol 15 min before sponging. There was 39 samples in tepid sponging and 39 samples in warm sponging, both were on oral paracetamol 10 to 15 mg per kg and not on IV paracetamol. The main focus of the study was on comfort of the child with reduction in body temperature [2]. This study shows that warm sponging is effective in promoting comfort among children with pyrexia than tepid sponging [3]. The study aimed to check if there is any significant association between level of comfort with selected demographic variables such as age, gender, religion, previous experience, type of illness, weight of child, and antipyretics.It is concluded that there is no significant association between the level of comfort and selected demographic variables (p > 0.05) [4].

Evidence:"The evidence looks promising that supplementing with magnesium daily can help reduce both the frequency and intensity of migraines. We will analyze the studies below. Does magnesium help only with migraine prevention or can it actually cure migraine pain? While magnesium supplementation appears to help with both the frequency and intensity (pain) of migraine headaches, it is not clear in most studies if supplementing with magnesium will help cure a migraine that you already have. Note: There is some evidence that it could help with acute migraine (see studies below)
Basically this means that you need to be taking enough magnesium daily to reduce the frequency and pain of your future migraines. If you take magnesium only while you have a migraine, you probably shouldn’t expect much."

                                Managing diabetes well
requires maintaining regular exercise, proper meal planning and taking diabetes medications as prescribed. Maintaining regular weekly exercise and physical activity is a key part of living well with diabetes.Our expert from Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a member of the     SingHealth​ group, Associate Professor Cindy Ng Li Whye from the Department of Physiotherapy weighs in - Exercise has been documented in many studies to improve the body’s ability to use the glucose in the blood and decrease insulin resistance. If you have diabetes, aerobic training such as walking, jogging and cycling, will help to control your condition to an extent similar to that of some oral diabetic medications. Weight training may be beneficial as it preserves muscle tissue that is otherwise slowly lost with age.Along with a proper meal planning approach and taking your diabetes medications as prescribed, a diabetic can still LIVE WELL!How exercise benefits people for diabetes“Physical activity increases your body cells’ sensitivity to insulin, ​making insulin work better for you in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy,” says Ms Kala Adaikan, Senior Principal Dietitian from the​ 
   Department of Dietetics at SGH.Your body cells can also remove glucose from your blood using a mechanism totally separate from insulin during exercise. Exercise has the potential to consistently lower your blood glucose levels and eventually lower HbA1c. This may result in you requiring fewer diabetes medications or less insulin.Exercise and risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) If you have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and are on insulin therapy, you are at risk of early (during exercise) and late onset (hours after or overnight) 
   hypoglycaemia after exercise.How your blood glucose levels behave will also depend on the following factors:
​Type of exercise (aerobic or anaerobic)
Duration of exercise
Intensity of exerciseDepending on these factors and your pre-exercise blood glucose levels, you may be required to take additional carbohydrates or reduce insulin, or do both.Recommended Amount of exerciseIf you have type 2 diabetes, at least 150 minutes of accumulated moderate intensity aerobic physical activity per week as well as resistance strength training is recommended.To achieve 150 minutes of physical activity in a week, try to do 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week.In addition, physical activity paired with a well thought-out meal planning approach and nutrition intervention for weight loss has been shown to help people achieve:Weight controlImproved glycaemiaImproved blood pressureImproved lipid profileBefore embarking on an exercise regimen, it i​​s essential that you receive prior education on exercise management strategies.If you want to be active, or you are experiencing hypoglycaemia with activity, you should seek advice from your diabetes care team."
Question:Does exercise help manage diabetes? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"“Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milk with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects,” adds Vallejo-Córdoba.Researchers from the Center for Food Research and Development and the National Technological Institute in Mexico report on previous hypertension studies and examine the potential pathways of gut modulation through antihypertensive fermented milk. The gut-hypertension linkSeveral studies have indicated that fermented milk may positively affect gut microbiota or provide antihypertensive effects, explains Vallejo-Córdoba. “However, few studies have shown a link between the antihypertensive effect of fermented milk and induced microbial balance (or eubiosis).” Vallejo-Córdoba remarks that in the past, the antihypertensive effect has been attributed mainly to angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) peptides with few studies attributing this effect to gut modulation.Association between dysbiosis of gut microbiota and hypertension (Source: Journal of Dairy Science).The complexity of hypertensionHypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, arises due to a variety of contributing factors such as genetics and the environment. However, there is also evidence to support that gut microbiota may also have an effect on the development of hypertension. Gut dysbiosis – a marked decrease in richness and diversity of the gut microbiota – has been linked to different metabolic diseases, including hypertension, they write. Gut microbiota have been found to influence intestinal development, barrier integrity and function, body metabolism, the immune system and the central nervous system."

Evidence:"In M4B, 37 patients were randomized in 3 groups receiving placebo (n=10) or dupilumab – either 150mg/qw (n=14) or 300mg/qw (n=13). In both studies, treatment with dupilumab resulted in a fast, dose-dependent efficacy in all clinical outcomes.51 The achievement of a 50% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-50) by day 29 was significantly higher for all dupilumab doses combined compared to placebo (59% vs 19%, respectively; p<0.05). Significant improvement in other clinical endpoints was observed in the combined treatment groups by day 29 when compared with placebo, including the investigator's Global Assessment score (IGA), the Body Surface Area (BSA) percentage and the pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS).Also, significant rapid dose-dependent changes in the RNA-expression profile in lesional skin were observed after 4 weeks of treatment with dupilumab, approaching non-lesional expression profiles and accompanying EASI improvement. An improvement of 24% and 49% was observed in lesional transcriptome in patients treated with dupilumab 150 and 300mg, respectively, as compared with a 21% shift to a lesional molecular phenotype in the placebo group (p<0.0001 for all groups).49 Also, the suppression in the expression of K16, a keratinocyte proliferation marker and regulator of innate immunity was observed, suggesting that dupilumab reduces epidermal hyperplasia.47Phase IIbThe phase IIb trial was a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in which 380 adult subjects with moderato-to-severe AD were randomized to placebo (n=61) or dupilumab 100mg every 4 weeks (qw4) (n=65), 200mg every 2 weeks (qw2) (n=61), or 300mg/qw (n=63), qw2 (n=64) or qw4 (n=65).52,53 Overall, dupilumab demonstrated higher effectiveness when compared to placebo at all dosing levels. At week 16, EASI scores were significantly improved in the dupilumab groups versus placebo group. The least-squares (LS) mean percent improvement in EASI scores were -74% (300mg/qw), -68% (300mg/qw2), -65% (200mg/qw2), -64% (300mg/qw4), and -45% (100mg/qw4) compared with -18% for placebo (p<0.0001 for all comparison)."

Evidence:"Participants were randomly assigned to either a wait list or eight weeks of twice-weekly yoga classes, plus a weekly practice session at home. Participants’ physical and mental wellbeing was assessed before and after the yoga session by researchers who did not know which group the participants had been assigned to.Compared with the control group, those doing yoga reported a 20% improvement in pain, energy levels, mood and physical function, including their ability to complete physical tasks at work and home. Walking speed also improved to a smaller extent, though there was little difference between the groups in tests of balance and upper body strength. Improvements in those who completed yoga was still apparent nine months later.Clifton O. Bingham III, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center, says the idea for the study grew out of his experiences treating patients with arthritis. “It was watching what happened with my patients and the changes in their lives as a result of practicing yoga that got me interested in the first place.”Compared with the control group, those doing yoga reported a 20% improvement in pain, energy levels, mood and physical function, including their ability to complete physical tasks at work and home Image is for illustrative purposes only.Safety was a priority in the study, the authors say. “For people with other conditions, yoga has been shown to improve pain, pain-related disability and mood,” says Bingham."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"According to science (and who can argue with science? ), this is a normal reaction and has been given a name: seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD lamps can help combat symptoms by providing you with a blast of light.Stephen Buckley, head of information at Mind, says: “If you have SAD, you might experience some of the signs and symptoms: lack of energy, finding it hard to concentrate, not wanting to see people, sleep problems, feeling sad, changes in appetite, being more prone to colds and infections, loss of interest in sex or physical contact, suicidal feelings or other signs of depression. But it’s different for different people, and can vary season to season.”SAD lamps are special bright lights that you sit in front of. It’s thought the bright lights hit your retina and trigger the brain to stop making so much melatonin, which will help lift your mood.It’s often recommended to use a SAD lamp during the dark mornings, so it doesn’t cause insomnia, but it’s also a case of trying different times of day and durations to find something that works best for you. You need to use the light consistently, but the good news is that if light therapy is going to work for you it should work within the first week.When choosing a SAD lamp, think about how you might use it."

Evidence:"You know you’re not supposed to pick at pimples, so… is there anything you can do to get rid of that maskne ASAP?You've probably heard that a dab of toothpaste can clear a pimple when you're in a pinch, which sounds like a pretty sweet life hack — after all, you can pretty much find toothpaste anywhere, anytime. Not to mention, it's a lot cheaper than most spot treatments.But none of that matters if it doesn’t actually work, so is there any truth to this home remedy? Seventeen reached out to certified dermatologists to clear the air (and hopefully, your skin) by debunking any skincare myths. Joshua Zeichner, M.D., director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said to Women's Health, "many toothpastes used to contain an ingredient called triclosan, which is an antimicrobial that helped kill acne-causing bacteria on the skin." But this ingredient turned out to be pretty controversial — the FDA suggests that triclosan could "negatively affect thyroid hormones.""

Evidence:"In spite of the controversy surrounding the SYSADOAs, they were commonly used to control symptoms of OA in western countries. Therefore, an understanding of chondroitin and glucosamine consumption is of significance for public health.In the previous meta-analysis, Richy and colleagues combined 7 trials of glucosamine and 8 trials of chondroitin for osteoarthritis treatment demonstrated comparable efficacies of chondroitin and glucosamine and a highly significant effectiveness of glucosamine on all involved outcomes when compared with placebo, which was contrary with our results of glucosamine and the combination therapy [47]. Collectively, their study showed that chondroitin was considered effective on pain relief, which was consistent with our finding. Additionally, a pair-wise meta-analysis of chondroitin by Monfort and colleagues suggested that chondroitin present a slight to moderate efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of OA, with an excellent safety profile [48]. The subgroup of our study covering 12 RCTs of chondroitin present that chondroitin showed significant effect in both outcome of pain and function improvement. In our study, only 4 RCTs met the criteria of combination therapy and were included in the subgroup of this meta-analysis."

Conclusions
Effect of combination of Omega-3 fatty acid and Simvastatin on hypertriglyceridemia [4]
Heart, 2001
To access the safety and efficacy of Omega-3 fatty acid and Simvastatin on hypertriglyceridemia
Double blinded randomized controlled trial
59 patients with CHD, on simvastatin 10-40 mg/d, with serum triglycerides > 2.3 mmol/l
1 year
Omacor (84% omega-3 fatty acid) 2 g BD or placebo
Decrease in serum triglycerides by 20-30% (p<0.005)
Decrease in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by 30-40% (p<0.005)
Omacor combination with simvastatin was found to be a safe and effective in decreasing serum triglycerides in coronary heart disease

Evidence:"Current laboratory and clinical data regarding the possibility of the role of probiotics on preventing the development of respiratory tract infections are contradictory, and are somewhat insufficient to recommend strongly their routine use. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions is likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of different pulmonary diseases, and improve our knowledge in the prophylactic role of probiotics in children affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.SummaryA better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs in infants and children. No data have been collected in pediatric patients with chronic underlying diseases, and yet there are no published data concerning treatment of RTIs with probiotics. The very few studies published so far do not indicate which micro-organism or administration regimen might exert beneficial effects as a prevention tool of RTIs both in healthy children and in those with recurrent RTIs. Further research to establish the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of RTIs, including those involving the lower respiratory tract, are required and should also clarify if any susceptible subgroups of respiratory diseases exist, and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains. Peer Review reports
BackgroundUnderstanding the microbiome of the airways in normal subjects is an essential step in overturning our way of thinking to respiratory medicine, as changes in this microenvironment could influence the nosography of upper and lower airways infections and even other clinical outcomes, such as complications after lung surgery."

Evidence:"Most common symptoms of RA include joint pain, swelling of joints, stiffness and loss of joint function. Besides medication, aromatherapy is also widely recommended in easing the mobility and to provide comfort for the inflamed, painful joints and tissues. Essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, basil are prepared from the extracts of plant compounds such as bark, leaves or roots and they provide instant relief from rheumatoid arthritis pain. Eucalyptus Oil Eucalyptus oil works great in lowering inflammation, swelling and pain due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies prove that topical application of eucalyptus oil or adding a few drops of it in the warm bath helps in alleviating pain. Frankincense Oil Frankincense oil is made from resin or sap from the Boswellia tree."

Evidence:"Science behind minoxidil
The mechanism by which minoxidil stimulates hair growth is not fully understood, but minoxidil can help reverse the hair loss process of androgenetic alopecia by the following means:
Reverses the miniaturisation of follicles
Increases blood flow around follicles
Stimulates follicle movement to growth phase
Extends each follicle growth phase
How does minoxidil help? Minoxidil is the only over- the-counter active ingredient clinically proven to help stop and even reverse hereditary hair loss, by reactivating your inactive hair follicles. WHAT CAUSES HAIR LOSS? There are quite a few causes of hair loss. The main cause in both men and women is hereditary hair loss which Regaine is scientifically proven to help stop and even reverse."

Evidence:"Children have been hospitalized and even lost their lives after ingesting these chemicals, which has been connected to the correlation. (36)
According to the findings of numerous comprehensive medical studies, including those carried out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, there is no evidence to suggest that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a ban on the promotion and sale of the Hoxsey Method in the United States on September 21, 1960. The FDA stated that the method was a “worthless and discredited” cure and that it fell under the category of quackery. (37)
Tijuana, Mexico’s Bio-Medical Center is currently the principal distributor of Hoxsey Method goods. In addition to traditional advertising channels, Hoxsey Therapy is promoted online; the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator raised concerns about this to practice in June 2008 “Despite the lack of proof that the Hoxsey treatment has any benefit in combating cancer, consumers can easily find a variety of unsubstantiated claims to the contrary on the internet at this very moment."
Question:Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"Some people might not experience any anxiety relief from L-theanine even after trying different doses. If this is the case, it's possible that L-theanine isn't the right supplement for you, and you might benefit from another type of anxiety treatment or should choose a supplement with other supporting ingredients. Supplementing L-theanine with other nutrients
L-theanine works best when taken in conjunction with other anxiety-reducing ingredients. L-theanine can be combined with magnesium, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids to create a well-rounded anxiety supplement. These other nutrients help to reduce anxiety by:
reducing stress and anxiety levels
improving sleep quality (13)
reducing inflammation (14)
balancing hormones (15)
A supplement such as Healthycell REM Sleep will enable you to sleep more easily by reducing anxiety symptoms and allowing your body to relax. However, it's not always sleep that needs to be looked at when suffering from anxiety."
Question:Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"Inhaling steam is a traditional remedy used by some to treat colds, but there’s no evidence it works for that either. A Cochrane review (a system in the UK where all the published evidence for and against a treatment is reviewed) into the practice found that there was no conclusive evidence that it eased cold symptoms or reduced the amount of rhinovirus (which causes colds) people shed. The virus causing the common cold is different to the one that causes Covid-19, but they both cause respiratory illness, which this ‘cure’ is claimed to alleviate. Treating Covid-19 with heat
Multiple trials of treatments for Covid-19 are currently running around the world, but none has yet been proven as a consistently effective cure (although some, such as corticosteroids have been used with some success). Although heat can destroy the virus in the context of disinfecting a surface, there is no evidence to suggest it will work the same way inside the human body. Heating up the sinuses via steam won’t guarantee the virus, if present, will also be heated up to those temperatures, without also damaging the body’s cells first."
Question:Does inhaling steam help treat common cold? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"AMES, IA – Exercising for half an hour may reduce symptoms of depression for at least 75 minutes post-workout and amplify the benefits of therapy, according to two new studies led by researchers at Iowa State University. “A lot of previous research on the effects of exercise on mental health, in general, have used very broad measures of wellbeing. What we were interested in, specifically, is: how does acute exercise – that is, one session of exercise in a day – influence the primary symptoms of depression,” said Jacob Meyer, a professor of kinesiology at ISU and the lead-author of both publications. For the first study, the researchers recruited 30 adults who were experiencing major depressive episodes. The participants filled out electronic surveys immediately before, half-way-through and after a 30-minute session of either moderate-intensity cycling or sitting, and then 25-, 50- and 75-minutes post-workout. Those who cycled during the first lab visit came back a week later to run through the experiment again with 30-minutes of sitting, and vice versa."

Evidence:"If a tick is still attached to the skin, it will need to be removed. Here's how: Removing a wood tickUse a tweezers and grasp the tick close to the skin (on its head).Hold the tweezers sideways next to the skin surface.Pull the wood tick straight upward without twisting or crushing it.Maintain a steady pressure until it releases its grip.Other options: If you don't have tweezers, you can use your fingers.You can also use a loop of thread around the jaws, or a needle pushed between the jaws for traction. Jaws are the part of the head attached to the skin.Not helpful: Covering the tick with petroleum jelly or nail polish doesn't work. Neither does rubbing alcohol or a soapy cotton ball. Touching the tick with a hot or cold object also doesn't work.How to remove the tick's headIf the wood tick's head breaks off in the skin, remove any large parts.Clean the skin with rubbing alcohol.Use a clean tweezers or needle to uncover the head and scrape it off.If a small piece of the head remains, the skin will slowly shed it.Removing a deer tickIf a deer tick is swollen, try to remove it with a tweezers.If it is tiny, it needs to be scraped off.Use the edge of a credit card.What to do after you remove a tickAfter you've removed a wood tick or deer tick, it's important to:Wash the wound and your hands with soap and water after removal. This helps to prevent catching any disease carried by the tick.Apply an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin."

Evidence:"Meta-analyses of Probiotics to Prevent Diarrhea
In 2012, highly publicized meta-analyses were published in JAMA[1] and Annals of Internal Medicine. [2] These studies, and a Cochrane review,[3] suggest that not only can probiotics prevent or diminish antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but probiotics may also be helpful in avoiding C difficile infection. (Enlarge Slide)
What are the data on this, and should we all be recommending probiotics? It's difficult to put into perspective, because when you look at the trials that were included in the recent meta-analyses, the individual studies were relatively small. Furthermore, there was incredible heterogeneity among these trials."

Evidence:"Supplementing with foods higher in Omega 3 may help reduce some of the behaviors that can be a part of borderline personality disorder.Sources of Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Salmon and other cold water fish, cod liver oil, walnuts, grass-fed beef, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, flax seed, hemp seed, and hemp oil.• Magnesium: Supplementing with magnesium—a natural muscle relaxer—may benefit individuals who are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and are experiencing migraines, depression, high anxiety, or have a co-occuring diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. In 2015, the authors of one study noticed a correlation between very low magnesium levels and the symptoms of BPD. Other research looked at the potential benefits of higher levels of magnesium, folate, and zinc in women with depression and anxiety. A study published in 2017 also recommended supplementing with magnesium for the treatment of depression.Some interesting research published in 2021 looked at low magnesium levels in children with “callous-unemotional” (CU) traits. The article suggests that nutritional supplementation or diets higher in magnesium  “…could improve CU traits in children.”Sources of magnesium: Epsom salt baths, leafy greens, dark chocolate or cacao, avocados, and salmon. Magnesium-supplemented products such as Natural Vitality Calm (and magnesium gummies) may also reduce insomnia when taken before bedtime.• Vitamin C: Vitamin C may also be beneficial in treating individuals with BPD whose symptoms are manifested through anxiety, restlessness, or nervous energy."

Evidence:"ChitosanHow it works: Chitosan is a sugar mainly derived from the outer skeletons of crustaceans. According to Sopczak, it is said to turn into a gel-like substance in the stomach which then binds to fat in the intestines, but evidence of this is inconclusive.What the research says: A 2018 review of 14 trials totaling 1,101 overweight or obese subjects found chitosan supplements slightly reduced body weight — by about 2.23 pounds — in overweight and obese people. Overall effectiveness: According to the NIH, chitosan does not bind to nearly enough fat to result in significant weight loss.Side effects: Chitosan is generally considered safe, but Sopczak says possible side effects include upset stomach, nausea, bloating, and constipation. ChromiumHow it works: The mineral chromium is believed to increase lean muscle mass while reducing body fat. It also helps insulin perform properly, which Sopczak says helps the body process carbs, fat, and protein more effectively.What the research says: A 2013 review of nine trials with a total of 622 participants found overweight and obese adults who took chromium picolinate (a supplemental form of chromium) lost an average of about 2.4 pounds after 12 to 16 weeks."

Evidence:"Unless you’re dealing with acute injuries like cartilage tears or fractures, there’s something that can be done to alleviate chronic hip pain that stemmed from overuse. Besides medical care, the pain of this kind can be managed at home through exercise. But why do we need to exercise it ourselves? Not to discount the benefits of physical therapy, your own effort can also augment professional treatment. Exposing your hip joint to regular exercise restores a good range of motion which gradually rebuilds strength and stability after an injury."

Evidence:"Not to mention their negative impact on sperm motility resulting in decreased fertilization and pregnancy rates. Enter antioxidants… 
Antioxidants have the exact opposite effect. They act as free radical scavengers and decrease the number of reactive oxygen species and associated cellular damage. Therefore, it makes sense that antioxidant supplements are promoted as improving sperm health. But the question remains whether or not antioxidant supplements are really beneficial for male fertility. There are arguments both FOR and AGAINST them… 
So today we want to present you with both sides of the story along with our take on the matter."
