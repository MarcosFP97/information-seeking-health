Evidence:"However, those with low blood levels will often require much higher doses to increase their levels to an optimal range (23).Though recommendations on what constitutes an optimal vitamin D level vary, most experts agree that optimal vitamin D levels lie between 30–60 ng/mL (75–150 nmol/L) (24, 25). SummaryThough research continues, evidence that vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is still limited. Having healthy vitamin D levels can enhance immune health and may be helpful in people with COVID-19.The bottom lineVitamin D plays many important roles in your body, including promoting the health of your immune system. Scientific research suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may protect against respiratory infections, especially among those who are deficient in the vitamin. Recent research indicates that sufficient vitamin D levels may help people with COVID-19 avoid adverse outcomes. Still, we don’t know whether taking vitamin D supplements reduces your risk of developing COVID-19 as a result of contracting the coronavirus.Talk to your doctor about supplementing with vitamin D to enhance your overall immune response."

Cleveland Clinic researchers have found that zinc or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) – or a combination of the two – do not significantly decrease the severity or duration of symptoms in COVID-19-positive patients, when compared to standard care. The study was published today in JAMA Open Network. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been widespread speculation about the role of various vitamins and supplements to prevent or treat it, but there remains limited scientific evidence. Zinc is known to be important for immune function. It also has a role in antibody and white blood cell production and can fight infections. Vitamin C, an antioxidant, can help reduce damage to cells, and has shown to be immune-boosting."

Evidence:"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is very low with a slower spread in those countries that have the universal BCG immunization program. Australia, Germany, USA, etc., started the clinical trial of the BCG vaccine in Health Care Workers and the Elderly Population to prevent the infection of COVID-19. The correlation of BCG vaccination with COVID-19 has shown fewer confirmed cases with low mortality and a high recovered rate in universal BCG immunization countries. Table 1 contains the data of BCG unimplemented countries, and Table 2 contains the data of universal BCG implemented countries. Several new vaccines are being developed by different companies and clinical trials have started, until approval or success of any clinical trial for the specific vaccine of COVID-19 the BCG vaccine might be used as a preventive treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic.Conflicts of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.Funding statementNone.

      Clinical trial testing ancient cold remedy for COVID-19 now open across the UK

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and BREATHE, the Health Data Research Hub for respiratory health, are seeking volunteers across the UK to take part in a clinical trial testing whether gargling and nasal washing with salt water can reduce the early symptoms and progression of COVID-19. Nasal washing and gargling with salt water has been used as a cold remedy for centuries in India, where it’s known as jala neti or nasyam. It was also used in the West as a preventive measure against the flu and other respiratory infections in the early 20th century but fell out of favour. The group recently identified the mechanism used by epithelial cells (such as those lining the nose and throat) to fight viral infections. These cells make use of chloride ions to fight viral infections, and supplying the chloride ion through salt, helps the cells clear the infection. Previous research has shown that nasal washing and gargling with salt water (a way to supply the cells with the chloride ion) can reduce the duration of the common cold by an average of 1.9 days, along with reduction in viral shedding and transmission within households."
Question:Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"RJ Nasir, a media personality from Jammu & Kashmir, went live on Facebook with Dr Sushil Razdan about the claim. About Ginger Powder Theory:According to The National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine, ginger cannot prevent or cure Covid-19. In the report, it mentions that drinking ginger tea or ginger powder, ginger capsules will not prevent or fight against Covid-19. There is some evidence that ginger can cure nausea, but combining ginger or taking ginger separately will not cure Covid-19. It further adds, viral infections spread in our body when the virus enters our cells and makes copies of itself and then those copies enter new cells and repeat the process. Ginger will not destroy the virus in our body or stop the copying process."
Question:Can Ginger cure COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In fact, these 5G-COVID-19 conspiracy theories have gotten so rampant that U.K. government officials actually have had to take time to discredit such theories, which is a wonderful use of time during a public health emergency:
Let’s be clear here. Your money is not sending you secret messages about 5G and the COVID-19 coronavirus. There is no scientific evidence that 5G towers are causing COVID-19 symptoms or that 5G radiation is making people more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infections. COVID-19 has a clear cause, a new coronavirus. It is a biological virus and not an electronic one. This virus can spread via person-to-person contact and respiratory droplets."
Question:Can 5G antennas cause COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no
7

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that tea will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Hot Khaada (or kadha or karha): Khaada is a drink often made with a combination of herbs, spices, and other additives that may include cloves, black pepper, ginger, basil, cardamom, fennel seeds, honey, ghee, amongst others. It is commonly used to “boost immunity” when people are sick. To date, there are no studies that evaluate Khaada as a therapy for COVID-19, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that Khaada will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate): Baking soda, which often used to help baked goods rise, has also been mixed into drinks by people seeking health benefits. While sodium bicarbonate is an active ingredient in some medications like antacids, people who plan to consume baking soda for health reasons on a regular basis should consult with a doctor."

Evidence:"ResultsIt's not yet known if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Dextromethorphan could be the choice for the dry cough that COVID-19 is best known for; guaifenesin that for wetter coughs. Again, the idea is to improve symptoms – neither will address the underlying virus. Sinus congestion and runny nose isn’t a typical symptom, but over-the-counter decongestants can help here. Zinc lozenges may help (or may not) reduce viral replication in the nose and throat, but their effectiveness with SARS-CoV-2 remains unproven. Those taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs for cardiovascular issues should continue to do so, Miller says, citing a March 17 American College of Cardiology statement that reads, in part, “The continued highest standard of care for cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is top priority, but there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients using ACE-I or ARB medications.” The statement does add the caveat that the recommendation could change with a better understanding of COVID-19 on these patients."
Question:Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Do masks protect the people wearing them or the people around them? “I think there’s enough evidence to say that the best benefit is for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from giving COVID-19 to other people, but you’re still going to get a benefit from wearing a mask if you don’t have COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong. Masks may be more effective as a “source control” because they can prevent larger expelled droplets from evaporating into smaller droplets that can travel farther. Another factor to remember, noted Rutherford, is that you could still catch the virus through the membranes in your eyes, a risk that masking does not eliminate. How many people need to wear masks to reduce community transmission? “What you want is 100 percent of people to wear masks, but you’ll settle for 80 percent,” said Rutherford."
Question:Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:""If we have desi gau mutra (urine from an indigenous cow) every day, then it cures lung infection from COVID. I am in deep pain but I take cow urine every day. So, now, I don't have to take any medicine against corona and I don't have corona," Thakur said, reported NDTV.The same claim was previously suggested by UP BJP MLA Surendra Singh. According to ANI, Singh claimed that drinking cow urine has protected him from coronavirus. He also recommended people to ‘drink cow urine with a glass of cold water’.In March 2020, the BJP’s Bengal Chief Dilip Ghosh, while talking at party programme, said there was no harm in drinking cow urine and that “I have no qualm in accepting I consume cow urine”. He also urged people to drink cow urine to prevent COVID-19.In the same month, the president of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, Swami Chakrapani, organised a ‘gau mutra party’ and invited world leaders to drink cow urine and skip meat to beat the coronavirus.ADVERTISEMENT'Applying Cow Dung on People a Cure For COVID-19'A video from Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul Vishwavidya Pratishthanam Gaushala recently went viral where people were seen smearing their bodies with cow dung and urine and then performing yoga to prevent COVID-19.A similar "hack" was used by some people in Karnataka last March when they took a bath in cow dung and cow urine to ward off the corona "bacteria".ADVERTISEMENTCow Dung Cake SanitisersMadhya Pradesh Culture Minister Usha Thakur on Sunday, 7 March 2021, advocated the need for a Vedic lifestyle for protection against coronavirus and claimed that ‘havan’ (ritual burning) of a cow dung cake can keep a house sanitised for 12 hours.“Mix ghee (clarified butter) made out of cow milk with rice."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as "flattening the curve," which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

Evidence:"Plus, vinegar’s bactericidal activity increased with heat! “The combined use of vinegar and sodium chloride, with use of an appropriate treatment temperature, was found to be markedly effective for the prevention of bacterial food poisoning.”
Household disinfectants — vinegar and baking soda used on their own — were highly effective against potential bacterial pathogens but less effective than commercial household disinfectants. Note: These ingredients are useful at home. But if you’re operating a food business, the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health states, “Products such as tea tree oil, baking soda, vinegar, electrolyzed water, microfibre cloths, ozone, and silver compounds are not registered disinfectants for food premises, according to the Health Canada definition.”
Vinegar and COVID-19
Although vinegar has disinfectant properties, there’s no scientific evidence or studies that show vinegar kills a virus like COVID-19. Health Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide ways to clean and disinfect for COVID-19."

Drug treatments for at risk adults with covid-19 who do not require oxygen: National Clinical Evidence Taskforce for COVID-19 Decision ToolRACGP Home-care guidelines for patients with COVID-19OseltamivirOseltamivir (Tamiflu®) can be used for treatment of people with suspected/confirmed influenza, or for prophylactic use in exposed people (primarily during influenza outbreaks in facilities and in people at high risk of severe disease). Treatment with oseltamivir may shorten the duration and severity of disease in people that already have influenza. Empiric treatment with anti-influenza medications should be considered for anyone presenting with moderate or severe disease, and for those presenting with mild disease and who are at risk of severe disease (based on clinical judgment).Clinical judgment should be on the basis of the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms when making antiviral treatment decisions for residents at increased risk of severe disease.Because the dose of oseltamivir may need to be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment, GPs should be aware of the person’s current renal function.When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after disease onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset.When influenza is confirmed in a facility, decisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza in every resident. If an influenza outbreak is confirmed in a residential care facility, your local public health unit will provide advice about which residents should receive oseltamivir as prophylaxis. Oseltamivir for prophylaxis is given once a day for 10 days and should be commenced as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) of outbreak recognition.Resources for the use of oseltamivirTamiflu ® (oseltamivir phosphate) Australian product information

Evidence:"While the path to recovery remains long and difficult, this crisis also increases the risk that individuals engage in harmful drinking to cope with stress. During the COVID‑19 pandemic, there has been an increase in domestic violence, for which harmful alcohol consumption is a risk factor.Harmful alcohol consumption damages health, causes diseases and injuries, weakens response to COVID‑19, and leads to significant economic and societal costs. Comprehensive policy packages built on a PPPP approach including Pricing policies, Policing to counter drink-driving, Primary care‑based counselling for heavy drinkers, and regulating alcohol Promotion activities, improve health, and support a stronger economic and social recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. Key findingsDuring the COVID‑19 pandemic, people have significantly changed drinking habits, shifting places of consumption from bars and restaurants to home. For many people, alcohol is part of their social life, a life that has been significantly disrupted by COVID‑19. Overall, most people did not change how much they drank but, among those who did, a larger proportion of people drank more."

Evidence:"Researchers studied 100 different Chinese cities that had more than 40 cases of COVID-19 from Jan. 21 to 23. A team of researchers unveiled the results of a new study last week that looked at how temperature and humidity may affect the transmission of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. According to the researchers' findings, “High temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.” An increase of just one degree Celsius and 1% relative humidity increase substantially lower the virus’s transmission, according to the data analyzed by the researchers. The study is the latest in a limited but growing body of research, not all of which has been peer-reviewed, that examines the effect of weather on the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 illness.

Some experts are now warning that several natural medicines, includingÂ turmeric,Â echinacea,Â licorice, and others might interfere with the bodyâs immune and inflammatory response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Make sure patients understand these warnings. Turmeric, echinacea, and licorice have anti-inflammatory properties similar to NSAIDs. Several months ago, Franceâs health minister claimed that taking NSAIDs might increase the risk of severe COVID-19. But currently there isnât any strong evidence supporting this claim â experts still believe that NSAIDs can be considered for use in patients with COVID-19, just as they would be for any other fever or infection. This new warning about natural medicines is also coming out of France, for similar reasons to the NSAIDs warning."

Eating a plant rich diet reduces risk of developing COVID-19
People who eat a high quality, gut friendly diet are less likely to develop COVID-19 or become severely ill. Those eating poorer quality diets are more at risk, especially if they live in a more socioeconomically deprived area. The study, published in GUT, by researchers from King’s and Harvard Medical School, examines data from nearly 600,000 ZOE COVID Study app contributors. Participants completed a survey about the food they ate during Feb 2020 (pre-pandemic), making it the largest study in this space. 19% of these contributors contracted COVID-19. People with the highest quality diet were around 10% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those with the lowest quality diet, and 40% less likely to fall severely ill. This is the first longitudinal study of diet and COVID-19 and the first to show that a healthy diet cuts the chances of developing the disease in the first place."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The effect of the use of ACEI and ARBs and the increase in ACE2 expression in the pathogenicity of the COVID-19 is not known. The virus may enter the cell due to increased ACE2 expression following the use of ACEI and ARBs. In addition, ACE2 converts vasoconstriction (by angiotensin 2) to vasodilation (by angiotensin 1–7) by converting angiotensin 2 to angiotensin 1–7. Some animal studies show that this vasodilation has an unspecified mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [18]. Despite the contradictory effects of ACEI and ARBs, there is no evidence to discontinue the routine use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients, and it is recommended to continue their routine usage [24,25,26]. Evaluation of various factors affecting the improvement or worsening of COVID-19 (including drugs) and complete vaccination of people worldwide can play a vital role in controlling the pandemic and reducing the number of deaths."

Evidence:"They have dismissed research suggesting that cigarettes or something in them may—and I emphasize “may” in this sentence—protect smokers from COVID-19, or at least minimize the severity of their symptoms if they do get sick. Writing in the June 2nd British Medical Journal, investigative reporters Stéphane Horel and Ties Keyzer discounted this possibility, alleging that the authors of some of the relevant research were in the pocket of Big Tobacco and their studies have been discredited:
In the early days of the pandemic, media outlets around the world reported that smokers seemed to be under-represented among patients seriously ill with covid-19 in China and France. The headlines asked, does nicotine protect against covid-19? … It has since been roundly disproved that smoking protects against covid-19 … the BMJ can today also report on undisclosed financial links between certain scientific authors and the tobacco and e-cigarette industry in a number of covid research papers. This, I think, is an inadequate assessment of the issue for two reasons."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Many studies have investigated the association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Data from theses studies suggest that the ABO blood group could be one of the factors that may play a role in determining COVID-19 susceptibilty, severity and mortality. The data reviewed in this review suggets that blood group O could potentially decrease the susceptibility against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. On the other hand, individuals with blood group A have been demonstrated to be at greater risk for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious outcomes. However, the studies discussed herein may have been influenced by several confounding factors. These confounding variables include the number of patients included, the types of controls used for comparison and the relative ABO frequencies in the population studied, as these variations in the ABO blood group frequencies between populations of different geographical locations may represent an important source of potential bias."

Evidence:"The majority of all respondents across the survey rounds perceived handwashing to be effective in preventing COVID-19 (74% and 75% in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively), while about 90% of respondents perceived personal action was important to prevent COVID-19 (92% and 91% in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively). At Round 1, about a third (31%) of participants knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19. By Round 2, this increased to 40% (p<0.001). Over half of all respondents reported that most people in their community perceived personal action was important to prevent COVID-19 (56% and 57% in Rounds 1 and 2, respectively).

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, gains entry into human cells by latching onto protein receptors called ACE2, which are found on certain cells’ surfaces. The researchers have proposed nicotine attaches to the ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the virus from attaching and potentially reducing the amount of virus that can get into a person’s lung cells. The researchers are now planning to test their hypothesis in a randomised trial involving nicotine patches; though the trial is still awaiting approval from French health authorities. So how should we interpret the results? These counterintuitive results may be due to several biases, so let’s explore some alternative explanations."

Evidence:"All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial. Vitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness. It is currently being studied in a clinical trial as a treatment for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in China and recommended as a supplement in standard treatment of COVID-19. There are no medications currently approved for treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is a known drug with low toxicity that may reduce progression of respiratory symptoms and resulting hospitalizations."

Elisabeth MahaseThe BMJThe UK’s drug regulator has approved the first monoclonal antibody treatment—Ronapreve, a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab—for the treatment and prevention of acute covid-19 in adults.1The treatment binds to two different sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, neutralising the virus’s ability to infect cells. It was given the green light after the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reviewed the available evidence. However, the government and NHS have yet to outline how the treatment will be used in practice.Japan was the first country to license the treatment in July after a phase III trial reported that casirivimab and imdevimab reduced hospital admission or death by 70% in high risk non-admitted patients. The treatment is administered either by injection or infusion and was found to reduce symptom duration by four days.2Casirivimab and imdevimab as a combination was also tested as part of the UK’s Recovery trial, which concluded that it reduced the risk of death when given to patients admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 who had not mounted a natural antibody response to the virus.3Ronapreve has been licensed in the US, India, Switzerland, and Canada, as well as by the European Union.Robust assessmentSamantha Atkinson, MHRA interim chief quality and access officer, said, “Ronapreve is the first of its kind for the treatment of covid-19, and after a meticulous assessment of the data by our expert scientists and clinicians, we are satisfied that this treatment is safe and effective."

KEY FACTS
The Georgia Department of Public Health has sent out an alert warning against consuming chlorine dioxide, a bleaching product. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) has been informed that the department is receiving reports about residents using chlorine dioxide to “treat” coronavirus. The FDA has warned since April about the dangers of using chlorine dioxide products as a treatment for Covid-19. Chlorine dioxide can lead to respiratory failure, liver failure and abnormal heart rhythms, among other potentially life-threatening conditions."

Evidence:"Results:
      Within the sample of children who visited emergency services with symptoms of potential COVID-19, we found higher prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results among those who were exclusively formula fed compared with those who were ever breastfed (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.45, 3.51; P = 0.036). Conclusions:
      The present study suggests that ever breastfeeding reduces the risk of COVID-19 among children, as documented for other infections. Keywords:

Taking a regular steroid inhaler reduces risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms for people with asthma
A summary of research published in the Lancet
A new study has found that taking a regular steroid inhaler can reduce the risk of severe symptoms of COVID-19. The research, published in the Lancet, aimed to understand whether existing lung conditions make people more severely ill with COVID-19 and whether medication for these conditions has an impact. What did the study look at? The researchers collected information from 75,463 people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK between 17 January 2020 and 3 August 2020. They looked at whether the person had asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both. They also collected information on their age, the medication they were taking, what treatment they received for COVID-19 and whether they died."

Evidence:"Collectively, these findings suggest that omega-3 fatty acids have properties that could improve oxygenation and outcome of COVID-19 patients. The utilization of omega-3-oil as safe, available and inexpensive therapy could be a promising therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, recent analysis of 8 studies showed that consumption of omega 3 oil up to 10 gm per day is safe in ICU. However, due to lack of sufficient clinical data supporting either the beneficial or harmful effects of omega-3 oil use in patients with COVID-19, the optimal strategy for the management of in COVID-19 is uncertain and remains to be elucidated - putting together all the known properties of omega 3 and what is known about the COVID-19, the investigators hypothesize that omega 3 could have a significant beneficial impact on the clinical outcome of infected patients. The aim of this study is to investigate in-hospital use of omega-3 oil and mechanical ventilator days, improvement in oxygenation, need for ventilator in non-ventilated patients, ICU- length of stay, hospital related length of stay, thrombosis, all-cause morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a in randomized prospective controlled trial. There is no study or evidence on Omega 3 and COVID-19 infection and respiratory failure."

Evidence:"In addition, its availability and price remain thorny issues for most countries. Based on the clinical understanding of this novel disease, we have raised high-dose IVIg as a possible solution to deteriorating patients with COVID-19, and reported three cases successfully treated with high-dose IVIg (20). Here, we reported 26 patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated by high-dose IVIg in addition to standard care, in comparison with those using standard care only. Overall, we found that administration of high-dose IVIg at an early phase of disease deterioration was associated with markedly reduced mortality, quicker normalization of inflammatory status, and improved clinical outcomes in COVID-19.Abundant real-world experience has demonstrated that infection of SARS-CoV-2 could be quite heterogenous. While the majority of infected individuals present as mild or moderate types with relatively benign recovery, around 20% infected patients may progress to more severe and critical types with higher risks of mortality. Moreover, the clinical events leading to unfavorable outcomes include not only the collapse of lung tissues, but also the associated fulminant systemic inflammation and coagulation disorders."

Evidence:"As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only. Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering."

Evidence:"Ethanol is the alcohol found in spirits, and another homemade sanitizer that has gained some attention uses vodka. Most vodka contains about 40 percent alcohol – not nearly enough for an effective hand sanitizer. But Balkan 176, the strongest vodka available in the UK, comes in at a staggering 88 percent ethanol. This could be used to make another 66 percent alcohol hand sanitizer with three parts vodka to one part aloe vera. At around £45 for 700ml it would make an expensive product, but since it was sold out on all the sites that we looked at, maybe there’s a market for it. A 2017 study showed that both ethanol and isopropanol preparations made to the official World Health Organization (WHO) formulations inactivate the Sars and Mers viruses, which are coronaviruses related to the one that causes COVID-19."

Detailed Description:
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus. The virus was first isolated from patients presented with pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. It is believed that the virus first emerged from patients working in the Wuhan Seafood Market which also sold contaminated wild animals, consumed as a local delicacy. Sequences of the Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats, sharing a common ancestor with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)."
