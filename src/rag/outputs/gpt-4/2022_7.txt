Evidence:"Make sure that the gauze is positioned directly on the extraction site; you may need to fold the gauze small enough to fit between adjacent teeth. If bleeding persists, a slightly moistened black tea bag can be a very effective substitute for the gauze (following the same instructions given for the gauze placement). One of the ingredients of regular black tea is tannic acid, and tannic acid aids in the formation of blood clots. It is both the application of firm pressure and maintaining this pressure that are important factors in controlling the initial bleeding after an extraction, although slight bleeding or oozing may occur several days after surgery. If heavy bleeding persists after these steps have been followed you should contact Dr. Bonine."

Evidence:"According to Avila, ancient Egyptians used crystals for healing and protection; sacred Indian texts explain specific healing properties of various crystals and how to use them to treat illnesses; Chinese medicine often includes the use of crystals; and ancient Greeks and Romans used crystals for protection in battle and in medical treatment—just to name a few examples.So perhaps it’s not so far-fetched that in modern days, we're turning to the potential healing powers of crystals and stones. Or is it? First, what do healing crystals do?“There’s no scientific research that backs up the claim that crystals can be used to cure disease,” says Navya Mysore, MD, a primary care physician and medical director of One Medical. Because illnesses are not caused by negative energy or wavelengths, crystals technically can’t cure disease in the way that crystal proponents explain, she says. However, let’s not disregard the power of crystals so fast. While there's no scientific evidence that they can fix medical conditions, they could have some mental and even physical benefits thanks to the so-called placebo effect, Mysore notes."

Evidence:"As cartilage and tendons are the main parts of the body affected by osteoarthritis in particular, collagen supplements can help relieve joint pain by enhancing the body’s natural collagen production, thus helping heal the cartilage around the joint. Collagen can help improve all joint or tendon pains, just as our founder Jennifer Mo found in her own experience, which you can read all about in her blog on returning to running. So, does collagen help arthritis? The short answer is yes. These effects, however, are significantly stronger when the collagen you take is specifically targeted, and that’s where Pura Collagen comes in. Flex+ and Arthritis

Evidence:"He said it caused his wife’s brain tumor. Ever since, the question of whether cell phones cause cancer has buzzed quietly in the background as the technology has become omnipresent in our lives.Numerous studies of cell phone radiation and cancer have been conducted over the years to address the issue, but none has been definitive.To obtain more solid evidence, a team of scientists at the National Toxicology Program, a division of the National Institutes of Health, undertook an in-depth study. Their approach was to expose laboratory rodents to high doses of cell phone radiation over their entire life span and see if they developed cancer as a result. The study cost $20 million and took more than ten years to complete. Final results were released to the public in November 2018. The argument that cell phones cause cancer lacks biological plausibility because the energy contained in the waves is too low to cause damage."

Evidence:"This is because the body slowly acclimatizes to the bites.According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI), a mosquito bite might cause anaphylaxis in rare cases. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes throat swelling, hives, faintness, or wheezing.Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention.ComplicationsThe risk of developing a serious disease is the most dangerous outcome of a mosquito bite.There are several harmful infections that mosquitoes can carry and transmit, including:Malaria: Parasites cause this life-threatening disease by infecting and destroying red blood cells. To control and treat malaria, early diagnosis is crucial.West Nile virus: Most people with West Nile Virus show no symptoms, although some develop a fever or other flu-like symptoms. For a small number of people with the virus, a serious illness develops in the nervous system.Zika virus: This is a generally mild condition that initially causes fever, joint pain, and rash. The initial symptoms of Zika usually pass after 1 week, but the disease can lead to congenital anomalies if a woman becomes pregnant after receiving a mosquito bite.Yellow fever: This virus causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Its symptoms include fever and sore throat.Dengue fever: This disease can trigger high fever, rash, muscle soreness, and joint pain."

Evidence:"Researchers have investigated the link in these children specifically but still no evidence for a link between autism and vaccines was found. Relative to the total number of people with ASD, very few parents actually report a dramatic loss of skills associated with a specific vaccination. However, parents who choose not to vaccinate their child (hoping to protect against autism) expose their child to other health concerns. And unfortunately, some of these unvaccinated children develop ASD anyway. Because professionals cannot provide parents a definitive explanation for the onset of autism in their child, any parent questioning the role of vaccines is understandable, but science does not support a link.

Evidence:"There has been work going on at the University of Arizona, using bicarbonate (baking soda) as a potential treatment for cancer. Robert J. Gillies and his colleagues have demonstrated that pre-treatment of mice with sodium bicarbonate results in the alkalinization of the area around tumors. (Raghunand 2003) This type of treatment has been found to “enhance the anti-tumor activity” of other anticancer drugs. This is very similar to the recently published research of injecting O2 directly into tumors where such direct administration of Oxygen also facilitated the action of chemotherapy. This year these same researchers reported that bicarbonate increases tumor pH (i.e., make it more alkaline) and also inhibits spontaneous metastases (Robey 2009). They showed that oral sodium bicarbonate increased the pH of tumors and also reduced the formation of spontaneous metastases in mice with breast cancer."

   Tweak Your Form  
If a squat exercise is causing you knee pain, it could be due to improper posture and form. Making a few small changes while squatting can actually prevent knee pain and protect your joints from more serious injuries, like sprains or tendonitis. Squatting with incorrect posture can cause strains, Dr. Enad says. To avoid these injuries, he suggests not to hunch too far forward during a squat or to stand too stiff, which can cause pain. "Focus on squatting movements where the hips shift back rather than straight down," says professional strength and conditioning coach Jerry Handley, owner and head coach at Viking Performance Training. Dr. Enad adds that "good form should feel like you're going to sit down into a chair behind you, leading with your buttocks, but staying well-balanced with good posture.""

Evidence:"For example, reports on the incidence of impotence range from 4% to 32% with thiazides, from 20% to 80% with methyldopa, and from 5% to 40% with propranolol therapy.8 Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not been generally associated with impairment of sexual activity,2,6,9 whereas impotence and impairment of ejaculation was occasionally reported by patients undergoing calcium antagonist therapy.9,10Such a difference in the reported incidence of sexual dysfunction symptoms during antihypertensive therapy may be attributable to the differences in methods, conceptualization and reporting, lack of standardized measures, different drug posology and duration of treatment, evaluation of sexual activity unrelated with age, marital status, and history of previous sexual dysfunction, which may all represent confounding factors.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two widely used antihypertensive medications, the β1-selective β-blocker atenolol and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, on sexual activity in newly diagnosed, never-treated essential hypertensive subjects, homogeneous for sex, age, marital status, and lack of previous sexual dysfunction symptoms. Methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. To study a relatively homogeneous population, patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were recruited: men aged 40 to 49 years, all married, with a newly diagnosed, never treated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥95 mm Hg) and without sexual dysfunction symptoms. Patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction or stroke, secondary hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, renal failure (serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL), diabetes mellitus, or any relevant chronic disease were excluded from the study. All patients gave their informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee.The study design consisted of a 4-week run-in period on placebo, followed by a 16-week active treatment period, during which the patients were randomly treated daily with 20 mg lisinopril or 100 mg atenolol. After another 4-week placebo period, patients were crossed over to the alternative regimen for a further 16 weeks."

Evidence:""Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits," they said.More research is needed, they added, but concluded: "Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk. "The research, published in the British Medical Journal, includes data on 187,382 people taken from three separate studies, of whom 12,198 developed type 2 diabetes.Food questionnaires were used every four years to assess diet and they asked how often, on average, people consumed each food in a standard portion size.Around 2.7 million people in the UK are diagnosed with type 2 and a further 850,000 are thought to have it but do not know it.Another seven million people are estimated to be at high risk of developing the disease which is linked to obesity and inactive lifestyle.Complications of type 2 include limb amputation, blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.Dr Matthew Hobbs, head of research for Diabetes UK, said: "The best way to reduce your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is to eat a balanced, healthy diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables and to be as physically active as possible. "This research provides further evidence that eating plenty of whole fruit is a key part of the balanced diet that will help you to achieve a healthy weight and so minimise your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. "However, the associations between Type 2 diabetes and specific types or fruit or fruit drinks must be treated with much more caution.

Evidence:"This could lower their cancer risks. Effects of avoiding dairyVegans also avoid dairy products, which some studies suggest may slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer (34).On the other hand, there is evidence that dairy may help reduce the risk of other cancers, such as colorectal cancer (35, 36). So, avoiding dairy may not be the factor that lowers vegans’ overall risk of cancer.It’s important to note that these studies are observational. They make it impossible to pinpoint the exact reason vegans have a lower risk of cancer.However, until researchers know more, it seems wise to focus on increasing the amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes you eat each day while limiting your consumption of processed, smoked, and overcooked meats.SummaryCertain aspects of the vegan diet may offer protection against several types of cancer, including prostate, breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers.A vegan diet is linked to a lower risk of heart diseaseEating fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and fiber is linked to a lower risk of heart disease (37, 38, 39).Well-planned vegan diets generally include all these foods in amounts higher than the standard Western diet.Observational studies comparing vegans with vegetarians and non-vegetarians report that vegans may benefit from up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure (40).Vegans may also have a lower risk of dying from heart disease, though more studies are needed to understand the relationship (40, 41).What’s more, several randomized controlled studies report that vegan diets are much more effective at reducing blood sugar, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels than the diets they are compared with (11, 12, 42).This may be particularly beneficial to heart health, since reducing high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels may reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 46% (43). A well-balanced vegan diet includes plenty of whole grains and nuts, both of which are good for your heart (44, 45).SummaryVegan diets may benefit heart health by significantly reducing the risk factors that contribute to heart disease.A vegan diet can reduce pain from arthritis A few studies have reported that a vegan diet has positive effects in people with different types of arthritis.One small study randomly assigned people with arthritis to either continue eating their omnivorous diet or switch to a whole food, plant-based vegan diet for 6 weeks (46).Those on the vegan diet reported higher energy levels and better general functioning than those who didn’t change their diet (46).Several other studies suggest a vegan diet may help improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including pain, joint swelling, and morning stiffness, but the relationship needs further investigation (47, 48).The vegan diet’s higher antioxidant, probiotic, and fiber content, as well as its lack of certain trigger foods, could be responsible for these benefits (47, 48).SummaryVegan diets based on antioxidant-rich whole foods may significantly decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Vegan recipe ideasNow that you’ve seen the potential benefits, you might be wondering how to add more plant-based meals to your rotation.

Evidence:"R. Part 330, hydroquinone and other non-prescription drugs that are not described in specified provisions are deemed new drugs, misbranded and must be subject to a new drug application. This change is the result of a loophole in the law that has implicated hydroquinone unnecessarily.” The recent U.S. ban follows prior bans in other parts of the world like Japan, Australia and Europe. “Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe because it is cyto-toxic, meaning it is toxic to the cells to prevent making of melanin pigments,” explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. The Concern About Hydroquinone New York dermatologist Jacob Levitt, MD explains that the main concern about over-the-counter hydroquinone is unmonitored overuse. “The concern is that this would lead to exogenous ochronosis, which is relatively rare but difficult to treat in darker skinned individuals.

Evidence:"A person with AIDS is very vulnerable to cancer and to life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.Though there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, a person with HIV who receives treatment early can live nearly as long as someone without the virus. And a study in 2019 in the medical journal, Lancet, showed that an anti-viral treatment effectively halted the spread of HIV.Where Did AIDS Come From? Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then led to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home."

Is it possible to drink too much?WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightA: What happens when you drink a lot of water depends on your health, your activity at the time and how much you mean by “too much.”The most likely outcome is just that you’ll urinate more frequently to get rid of the excess water.But it is possible to go overboard. Normal kidneys can release up to a quart of fluid every hour. If you drink more than that, you’ll retain the excess water in your body, which causes a condition known as hyponatremia and can be hazardous to your health. Mild hyponatremia causes few symptoms, but more severe cases — when your blood sodium levels go below 130 mEq/L — can lead to brain swelling and progressive neurological symptoms, including confusion, disorientation, seizures, coma and sometimes death.Sign up for the Well+Being newsletter, your source of expert advice and simple tips to help you live well every dayHyponatremia was the cause of death in a participant in a 2007 radio contest in California, in which the prize went to whoever could drink the most before having to urinate. The contestant died after reportedly drinking nearly two gallons of water over two hours — clearly exceeding what her kidneys could handle, which would be about two quarts, or a half gallon, over two hours."

Evidence:"HIV cannot be spread from one person to another in any of the following ways:Casual contactIn studies of hundreds of households in which families have lived with and cared for people who have AIDS, including situations in which no one knew that the person was HIV-infected, HIV was spread only when there was sexual contact or needle-sharing with the infected person or contact with the infected person's blood.HIV is not spread in such settings where exposures are repeated and prolonged and can involve contact with an infected person's body fluids, so it is even less likely to be spread in other casual social settings, such as schools and offices.Saliva, sweat, tears, urine, or fecesHIV cannot be spread by sharing drinking glasses or by casual kissing. The risk of spreading the virus through "deep" kissing in which large amounts of saliva are exchanged is extremely low. Only one unproven case has ever been reported.No cases of HIV spread have ever been reported after a person has come in contact with the sweat, tears, urine, or feces of an HIV-infected person.VaccinesHIV is not spread by vaccines made from blood products, such as the hepatitis B vaccine and various immunoglobulins approved for use in Canada and the United States.Hepatitis B vaccine now contains no human tissue or blood.The other products are made from screened blood or plasma and undergo purification that destroys any harmful viruses or bacteria.InsectsHIV is not spread by insects. Insects do not become infected and their saliva does not contain the virus. Blood-sucking insects, such as mosquitoes, do not inject blood into the next person they bite.Contact with common objectsHIV is not spread by touching common objects such as toilet seats or faucet handles.Related InformationHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) InfectionCreditsCurrent as of:  July 1, 2021 Author: Healthwise StaffMedical Review: E.

Evidence:"As the HPS lamp warms up from the heat produced by the light bulb inside, that same water then evaporates back into the air and the trapped particles of dust, pollen, smoke, etc remain locked in the salt. What are the health benefits of Himalayan Salt Lamps? 1. Cleanse & Deodorize the Air
Probably the most well-known benefit – and why the majority of people use them – is due to their incredible power to remove dust, pollen, cigarette smoke, and other contaminants from the air. 2. Reduce Allergy & Asthma Symptoms
Because Himalayan salt lamps remove microscopic particles of dust, pet dander, mold, mildew and the like from the surrounding air, placing a lamp or two in the rooms where you spend the most time can seriously cut back on allergy symptoms."

Evidence:"You are not likely to get pregnant if these three things are happening at the same time:﻿﻿
You're breastfeeding exclusively around the clock without giving your child any supplementation
Your baby is under 6 months of age
Your period has not yet returned 
For many women, the ability to get pregnant returns once breastfeeding is no longer exclusive. By 6 months, your child will start eating solid foods and may also be sleeping through the night. Since you will naturally be breastfeeding less often and going for longer stretches of time between nursing sessions, your fertility may begin to return. Your Period While Breastfeeding
   How to Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding  
If you don't want to give up breastfeeding, but you're anxious to start trying for another baby, you can go ahead and try. If you aren't finding success, you can cut back on nursing and partially wean the child you're breastfeeding. Breastfeeding less often, such as only in the morning and at bedtime, may be enough to bring about the return of your period."

Evidence:"In fact, we identified that statin effects varied in quality, strength and appearance depending on user age. Specifically, statins improved reaction time in older persons and fluid intelligence in both age groups, while leading to a working memory decline in middle-aged users.A concern when considering variable outcomes of studies of statin cognitive effects is weaknesses in study design, specifically a confounding effect through reverse causation and selection bias (extensively discussed in Power et al.3). Reverse causation could result from including subjects with already prevalent cognitive impairment or from drop-out of statin users that discontinued their medication. In both cases, the cognitive status of the individuals might have an influence on their statin use rather than their statin use having an influence on cognitive function. Also, in both cases, this could result in false positive results on statin beneficial effects or false negative results on statin detrimental effects. In order to avoid such bias, we only included subjects without disease background that could account for cognitive problems, and excluded statin discontinuers from the time of discontinuation."

Evidence:"According to the CDC (opens in new tab), you will likely see maximum results by focusing on a nutrient-dense diet and portion control while upping your exercise. Since black coffee contains negligible calories, you can still enjoy it in moderation as part of your plan. But while coffee may play a role in boosting your metabolism and reducing your appetite, the jury’s out on the extent of the impact. Research (opens in new tab) also shows that caffeine affects individuals differently, making it tricky to generalize its effects. “Does coffee help you lose weight?,” asks Dr. Shyamala Vishnumohan (opens in new tab), qualified food and nutrition expert, certified prenatal dietitian, and founder of One to One Thousand Nutrition Clinic, based in Perth, Australia. “Probably not, and certainly not without a calorie deficit."

Evidence:"Lastly, In Canada, Hu et al. (28) found that consumption of processed meat increase risk of both proximal and distal colon cancer in men and women (all four OR were between 1.4 and 1.6, all CI:1.0–2.0, 2.2 or 2.4). Bacon intake was particularly associated with risk of colon cancer (proximal and distal) in women.The estimation of cancer risk associated with meat may be influenced by other dietary factors, as shown clearly in the “dietary pattern” studies cited above (20–22). In those studies, the intake of processed meat was associated with intake of French fries (or potatoes), sweets, cakes, desserts, snacks and alcoholic beverages: These high glycemic index diets, and alcohol intake, may be risk factors for colorectal cancer. In addition, high-meat diets have been negatively associated with food groups rich in antioxidants and fiber, components which have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (4). Thus, the effect of processed meat consumption on the risk of colorectal cancer may be confounded by other foods, as discussed further in the “Indirect mechanisms” section below."

Home » Boost Fiber in Your Diet to Prevent Hemorrhoids
April 20, 2018 
      Increasing fiber in the diet is one easy, straightforward lifestyle modification that can help prevent hemorrhoids. Fiber bulks up the stool, helping to keep you regular. It also works to prevent constipation, a significant risk factor for enlarged, painful hemorrhoids. Currently, it is recommended that women consume 25 grams per day, while men need around 38 grams per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and many fortified foods are all excellent sources of fiber."
Question:Does a high fiber diet help with hemorrhoids?
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"While grapefruit is a nutritious fruit, many patients are concerned about the potential for drug interactions with grapefruit juice. Maybe you've receive a medication prescription container with an affixed warning label that recommends you avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking the medication. Grapefruit juice interactions can even occur with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. But why is this so important? Interactions with grapefruit can occur with common and important medications - such as those that lower cholesterol, treat high blood pressure, or even those that fight cancer. Grapefruit juice affects how drugs are changed (metabolized) in the body for eventual elimination and can alter the amount of drug in your blood."
Question:Can grapefruit interfere with medication?

Evidence:"E-cigarettes have been the most common tobacco product among youth since 2014. An e-cigarette, or vape pen, is an electronic device that heats a pod of liquid, turning it into vapor that contains nicotine, flavorings and other substances. The chemicals in the liquid that's vaporized and inhaled can be harmful — especially to teens. Behaviors and Risks
Blair Elise Wright, MD, is a pediatrician at Northwestern Medicine. She says that while some of her patients vape every day, others only vape when they are with their friends at school or on the bus. "Of my pediatric patients who have told me that they vape, none of them have reported doing so in order to quit smoking cigarettes," she explains."
Question:Can vape pens be harmful?

Evidence:"Unfortunately, it doesn’t work in diabetic patients as their insulin production is impaired or cells are non-responsive to insulin. Without proper diabetes management, people with diabetes may experience blood sugar spikes after eating high carbohydrate foods, which are highly unhealthy.According to USDA, a medium-sized banana contains about 27 grams of relatively high carbohydrates. However, bananas also have about 3 grams of dietary fibre. According to a study, fibre helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. It, in turn, reduces the blood spikes and overall contributes to blood sugar management. Therefore, a better way of determining the effects of bananas on blood sugar levels is by looking at their glycemic index and glycemic load.Do Banana have a High Glycemic Index?The glycemic index (GI) measures blood sugar levels after eating a particular food, and the GI values help identify whether a food is suitable for people with diabetes or not."
Question:Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?

Evidence:"In another study published in the journal Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry, people lost an average of four pounds in 12 weeks after consuming one to two tablespoons of diluted apple cider vinegar daily.So it is true: Apple cider vinegar has helped study participants lose weight, according to research.And the acetic acid in vinegar may be beneficial in other ways, because it may suppress appetite, says Johnston. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to be most effective when paired with a diet full of starchy foods, as the acid slows down the digestion of starch. This could potentially assist those looking to lose weight, because slow digestion keeps you feeling fuller, longer. There’s also some evidence that drinking apple cider vinegar before a starchy meal keeps your blood sugars stable, making you less likely to crave sweet snacks. But does apple cider vinegar actually work to help you lose weight? Johnston says it's worth trying—provided you're not looking for immediate results.9dreamstudioIf you eat whole foods with a high starch content, such potatoes or rice, you can try making apple cider vinegar a daily precursor to your meals.How much apple cider vinegar should you take?There is no official recommended dosage, because the research on apple cider vinegar use is limited.But Johnston recommends mixing one to two tablespoons with eight ounces of water to drink before meal time."
Question:Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?
