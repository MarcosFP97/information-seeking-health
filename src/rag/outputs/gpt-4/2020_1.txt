Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"As a result, in critically ill COVID-19 patients, suppression of cytokine storms and immune function attacks (hyper-inflammation) may be the appropriate treatment strategy. Vitamin C is one of the nutrients of interest in COVID-19 cure and prevention. Vitamin C may have a number of immune-modulatory mechanisms that can help to mitigate or reduce COVID-19 pathophysiology (4, 5, 9–11). Vitamin C may act as an antioxidant (9–11). Vitamin C supplementation is thought to help reduce oxidative damage and thus prevent worsening internal vascular endothelial injury (4). It has been proposed that vitamin C also can protect against cytokine attack during SARS-CoV-2 infections (4, 5, 9–11) (Tumor Necrosis Factor)."

Evidence:"The BCG-vaccinated group also displayed protective effects against other infectious diseases, including fewer symptoms, lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient. No BCG-related systemic adverse events occurred. BCG’s broad-based infection protection suggests that, in addition to COVID-19, may potentially provide protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens. The researchers are hoping the results will spur a larger scale study of the effects of the BCG vaccine in patients with type 1 diabetes, considered among the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19. The BCG vaccine is an avirulent tuberculosis strain Mycobacterium bovis historically given to protect against tuberculosis and, since its introduction in 1921, has been the most widely administered vaccine in the history of medicine. Considered to be extremely safe, BCG is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines and is given to roughly 100 million children per year globally."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"None of the reports about the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 mention the use or not of paracetamol before or in the early stages of infection, whereas this use is widespread [31–33].These findings raise the following points:An indication bias may exist: more severe cases with more symptoms and higher fever might not respond well to the first-line antipyretic paracetamol, so ibuprofen would then be used (channeling). The same has been described with soft-tissue infection [34]. This may be compounded by a reporting notoriety bias [35], where only cases exposed to ibuprofen are reported.The reality of an increased risk of severe pneumonia in patients chronically on drugs that upregulate ACE-2, such as NSAIDs, ACEIs, or ARBs, has not been shown; in fact, upregulating ACE-2 might also have beneficial effects [20, 21, 25]. Prior use of ACEIs either did not change or reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 [22].In a study of associations between exposure to ACEIs or ARBs and influenza, the risk of influenza was lower with ACEIs or ARBs, and this protection increased with the duration of use [36]. Preexisting diseases that may also be worsened by long-term NSAIDs, such as hypertension or heart failure, seem to increase the risk of mortality in COVID-19 [22, 37, 38].A public health decision based on a few anecdotal reports and irrelevant experimental data may have deprived patients of a drug effective at controlling pain and fever. Encouraging the use of paracetamol while discouraging the use of ibuprofen might induce patients to use higher doses of paracetamol rather than adding ibuprofen for symptom control, increasing the risk of hepatic injury [31, 39–41], which might also be increased by COVID-19-related alterations of liver function [42–44].At this point, there exist no scientific data to support an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity with ibuprofen."

Gargle formulations with cetylperidinium chloride, chlorhexidine and hexetidine have great potential in reducing SAR-CoV-2 at the source of entry into the body, thus minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19. IntroductionSince its first discovery in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 200 million people and caused more than 4 million deaths worldwide1. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated as the causative agent of COVID-19 based on genetic analysis of the virus from the first few cases detected in Wuhan, China2.

Evidence:"The proportion of patients’ hospitalization for COVID 19 treatment was also lower among ginger users (28.0%) than in nonusers (38.0%).46 In a study from Bangladesh, a few cases of cured COVID-19 patients were described who consumed home medicines containing ginger in mixes of various herbs with or without the use of additional treatments.47 According to the results from a Tunisian study, treatment of a few cases of COVID-19 with home medicines containing ginger in combinations with other herbs reduced disease symptoms.48 In some parts of Africa, acclaimed remedies containing ginger in mixes of various herbs were also used for the management of COVID-19.49 The results from a clinical trial study from Iran indicate that a combination therapy by ginger and Echinacea in suspected COVID-19 outpatients attenuated some of their clinical symptoms (breath shortness, coughing and muscular pain) in comparison with those treated with a standard protocol using hydroxychloroquine, alone.50 In addition, the hospitalization rate in the intervention group (2.0%) was lower than that in the control group (6.0%).50 The results from a randomized-controlled study showed that the patients with ARDS who were fed an enteral diet enriched with ginger extract for 21 days exhibited greater oxygenation, lower serum concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, and spent shorter time on mechanical ventilation compared to control group. However, organ failure, barotrauma and mortality rate similarly occurred in ginger-treated patients and control group.20 Ginger can have beneficial impacts in patients suffering from pulmonary complications such as ARDS, lung fibrosis, and pneumonia, as well as sepsis, all of which are signs observed in COVID-19.51 Overall, the aforesaid evidence indicates that more high-quality controlled trials need to confirm the effectiveness and safety of ginger or its compound in COVID-19 patients. A clinical trial is going on in Iran, in which a total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were randomly classified into two groups of each with 42 participants, including intervention and control groups. The intervention group will be administrated standard treatment protocol plus 1000 mg ginger three times daily for seven days, whereas the control group will be received standard treatment plus placebo tablets at the same dose and timing.52
Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidative potentials of gingerGinger potentials to modulate the neutrophil responsesThe neutrophils from COVID-19 display an activation status. Neutrophil activation and degranulation can promote inflammation and hemorrhagic lesions in the pulmonary system of COVID-19 patients.53 Lymphopenia and a higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio also happen in patients with severe COVID-19.54 Patients with COVID-19 exhibited high circulating levels of calprotectin (a neutrophil activation marker) and its quantities were higher in patients who had progressed to the severe form of the disease.55 During viral respiratory infections, the quantities of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 8, which is a neutrophil-recruitment chemokine, in the secretions of airways were positively related to the count of neutrophils, amount of neutrophil-derived elastase, and clinical scores.56
,
57 Activated neutrophils displayed NETosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation leading to lung injury, which promotes ARDS.56 The interaction of viral proteins with TLR4 triggers NETosis which consists of large extracellular, web-like structures.56
,
58
In an experimental inflammatory model, ginger aqueous extract dose-dependently attenuates the neutrophil infiltration and activation that assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) production.59 Ginger aqueous extract also reduces leukocyte infiltration in an animal model of allergic asthma.60 GEO potently suppresses the ROS production by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated human neutrophils.61 In a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI), pretreatment with zingerone decreases lung histopathologic alterations, alveolar hemorrhage as well as neutrophil accumulation and MPO activity.21 Ginger extract inhibits the CXCL8 production by fibroblast-like synovial cells collected from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis.62
Ginger potentials to modulates the macrophage responsesSARS-CoV-infected human macrophages express C–C chemokine ligand (CCL2), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, MIP1α), CCL8 (MCP2), CCL7 (MCP3), and CXCL10.63
,
64 Treatment of the human monocytes with the purified S protein of SARS-CoV promotes CCL15, CCL16, CCL19, CXCL10, and CXCL11 expression.65
,
66 Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected human macrophages express CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, interleukin (IL-2), and IL-3.67 SARS-CoV-2 can infect several monocyte and macrophage subsets via ACE2-related and/or ACE2-unrelated paths.68 SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes/macrophages secrete great concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators causing local organ inflammation and cytokine storms. Raised quantities of IFN-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL8, CXCL10, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP1, MIP1A, and MIP1B were observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in those who required ICU services.69 Both localized organ inflammation and cytokine storm have critical roles in the exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2-related consequences.68
Elevated amounts of neutrophil-recruitment chemokines (including CCL7 and CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL2) and monocyte/lymphocyte-recruitment chemokines (such as CCL20, CCL8, CCL7, CCL4, CCL3, CCL2 as well CXCL11 and CXCL6) were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens collected from COVID-19 patients.9 Chemokines recruit leukocytes into the lungs, thus performing an essential role in the occurrence of pulmonary abnormalities.9 Patients suffering from severe and moderate COVID-19 display greater frequencies of M1-like macrophages in BALF and greater CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 quantities in circulation than healthy individuals.70
Two major subsets of macrophages, including M1-and M2 macrophages generate large amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12, nitric oxide (NO), and ROS) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-10, TGF-β and IL-1 receptor antagonist), respectively.13
,
71 Greater proportions of FCN1+- and FCN1lo SPP1+ macrophages (M1-like type) were detected in the BALF samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19, while BALF specimens that collected from patients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals had greater numbers of FABP4+ macrophages (M2-like type).70 In animal models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the differentiation of lung macrophage to an M1-like phenotype limits the virus replication.72 The sharp depletion of M1-like macrophages occurs during SARS and influenza A infections, which supports the viral expansion.72 The improper activation of M2 macrophages leads to lung fibrosis, while hyper-activation of M1 macrophages exacerbates harmful inflammatory responses.73
,
74 However, mitigation of the RSV-linked immunopathologic consequences needs a balanced induction of the M1-and M2-like macrophages.72
,

Evidence:"He also noted that “regulators have set limits on the radiation power of 5G devices, though additional safety studies may still be warranted.”
And, such radiation can’t cause COVID-19. COVID-19 is a viral disease that comes from the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of similar myths in the future, experts need to consistently and clearly correct common misconceptions. And better transparency from both government bodies and researchers could prevent misinformation from ever taking root. “We [researchers] need to humanize the conversations around misinformation and continue to share true information so that misinformation becomes less prevalent in the media,” said Nsoesie.

Evidence:"The complaint also alleges Earth Tea is an unapproved new drug the defendants are selling in violation of the FDCA. The complaint seeks civil penalties and other available equitable relief, as well as an injunction to stop the defendants from continuing their unlawful marketing and sales of Earth Tea. “The Department of Justice will not tolerate individuals or companies seeking to profit from the COVID-19 public health emergency by unlawfully advertising unproven products,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

Evidence:"On February 8, 2022, IDSA strongly recommended against using convalescent plasma in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Among ambulatory patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high risk of progression to more serious symptoms and have no other treatment options, infusing high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset is better than not infusing it, according to the guideline, which described this as a conditional recommendation with low certainty of evidence. The FDA’s most recent revision of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, published December 28, 2021, limits treatment with high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients who have immunosuppressive disease or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies show that convalescent plasma is unlikely to be associated with clinical benefit in immunocompetent individuals with COVID-19, according to the FDA. Interestingly, the WHO recommends against its use for patients who aren’t severely ill, calling the evidence for that position “certain.” Convalescent plasma should be used only within clinical trials for severe and critical patients with COVID-19, the WHO said in December 2021. In a letter to the BMJ, Casadevall and coauthors urged the WHO to reconsider, saying that the organization “avoided digging below the surface to ask critical questions about treatment timing, study populations, and antibody titre” of the convalescent plasma in the trials it considered."

Evidence:"In a recent study, SERMS appear as the most promising drugs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in women affected by hormone-driven cancers when compared to other antiestrogenic therapies [125, 126]. More efforts will help a future understanding of the molecular basis of this putative protective effect, before the use of SERMs and/or other antiestrogenic therapies in the prevention of COVID-19. What we intend to recommend is that any decision in treating the patients with these drugs should be taken patient by patient, keeping in mind the accumulated knowledge.Androgen deprivation and antiandrogen therapy is used routinely in prostate and in mammary cancer [127].These treatments should not be discontinued for the fear of COVID-19 infection or complications.Undergoing clinical studies will help to uncover positive or negative effects of sex hormones blockers in the spreading or progression of COVID-19, opening to the extended use of these drugs to both sexes and even to healthy individuals at increased risk of infection (Table ​(Table11).ConclusionsIn the handling of COVID-19 infection sex-related differences are represented in the initial approach to viral infections, in dimorphic hormonal signaling pathways, and in differential risk profile based on socio-cultural factors. Due to differences between different sexes in laboratory values and biomarkers, sex-dependent diagnosis and treatment methods may be needed for accurate and effective therapy.Understanding the metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions potentially linked to the exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may support the discovery and biological interpretation of unrecognized pathogenetic bases in COVID-19.The sex differences observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex on morbidity and lethality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex. The ongoing clinical studies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease should certainly encompass sex-sensitive analyses. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.The accumulated data so far indicate that sex hormones could be critical in explaining sex-related differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Fig."

“In this study, researchers looked at how 69 drug compounds interacted with COVID-19 proteins using cells grown in a laboratory and performed two sets of experiments; only one found a pro-viral effect with dextromethorphan. These experimental findings do not establish an adequate scientific basis to suggest that use of dextromethorphan-containing products promotes COVID-19 infection. “Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines containing dextromethorphan are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are safe and effective if used according to the Drug Facts label.

How well do face masks protect against COVID-19?Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly.By Mayo Clinic Staff
Can face masks help slow the spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Yes. Face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as getting vaccinated, frequent hand-washing and physical distancing, can help slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends masks for the general public. If you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases, the CDC recommends wearing a well-fitted mask indoors in public, whether or not you're vaccinated. The CDC says that you should wear the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable."

Evidence:"So far in Modern Western Medicine (MWM), no cure has been found which is specific to COVID-19. The only literature relevant to the treatment of Coronavirus disease has surfaced from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM which was extensively used to control the epidemic in China, also consists of herbal medicines similar to Ayurveda. In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill. Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the variety of pertinent medicines present in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia which can be used more rationally to suit every stage of the disease."

Studies have shown that long-term alcohol abuse and acute binge drinking are associated with immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral infections (19, 20). Therefore, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. However, in our dataset, only a few participants reported heavy alcohol consumption, which may be reflective of the healthier nature of study participants. The potential association of heavy alcohol consumption with COVID-19 and associated mortality should be further explored in a larger sample sized cohort (although ascertaining the prospective effect of heavy alcohol consumption would be challenging because heavy drinkers would be unlikely to volunteer for such studies).

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods."

Evidence:"Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2.1 Remdesivir retains in vitro neutralization activity against the Omicron variant and its subvariants.2-5Intravenous remdesivir is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥28 days and weighing ≥3 kg. In nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe disease, remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset and administered for 3 days. Hospitalized patients should receive remdesivir for 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first.6 See Table 4e for more information.Remdesivir has been studied in several clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The recommendations from the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) are based on the results of these studies. See Table 4a for more information.RecommendationsFor the Panel’s recommendations and information on the clinical efficacy of using remdesivir to treat high-risk, nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, see Therapeutic Management of Nonhospitalized Adults With COVID-19. For the Panel’s recommendations and information on the clinical efficacy of using remdesivir with or without immunomodulators to treat certain hospitalized patients, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults With COVID-19."

Evidence:"Time alone has hitherto proven most effective in their restoration, but turmeric, long believed by some to have medicinal properties, may be a swifter and surer alleviator of anosmia and ageusia. This case series reports the speedy and consequential restoration of taste and smell in two subjects infected with COVID-19 following ingestion of one 1000 mg dose of a turmeric supplement. In view of this, we propose that turmeric be considered in the treatment of anosmia and ageusia caused by COVID-19 infection.Keywords: curcumin, covid-19, coronavirus, sars-cov-2, anosmia, ageusia, hyposmia, dysgeusia, turmericIntroductionAnosmia and ageusia are common and often comorbid symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The frequency of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in infected individuals has been reported to be 19.4-88% [1]. While most of those infected recover smell and taste, up to 20% experience persistent anosmia or hyposmia and ageusia or dysgeusia after 30 days [2].The mechanisms by which COVID-19 causes anosmia and ageusia are unknown; they may be similar to those of other coronaviruses. Upper respiratory viruses are known to cause nasal mucosal swelling and olfactory cleft conductive blockade [3]."

Evidence:"In a single-centre, cross-sectional study of 206 Iranian patients with COVID-19, those with higher fruit and poultry consumption and lower tea consumption were less likely to have severe COVID-19.17 Our findings were similar to this prior study in that participants who reported following plant-based diets or a spectrum of plant-based diets (plant-based diets or pescatarian diets) had a non-significant higher intake of fruits. However, in our study, participants who were following plant-based diets or pescatarian diets had higher consumption of other food groups (vegetables, legumes, nuts) and lower consumption of poultry. Such differences in results may be due to differences in dietary patterns among Iranian adults relative to our study population, and our focus on dietary patterns rather than intake of specific food groups.Plant-based diets or vegetarian diets are dietary patterns that are high in plant foods and low in animal products.12 13 Consistent with this definition, participants who reported that they followed plant-based diets or vegetarian diets had higher intake of plant foods (vegetables, legumes, nuts) and lower intake of poultry and red and processed meat. Plant-based diets are rich in nutrients, especially phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids),13 18 with prior studies reporting higher fibre, vitamins A, C, and E, folate, and mineral (iron, potassium, magnesium) intake among those with highest versus lowest adherence to plant-based diets.12 19 Studies have reported that supplementation of some of these nutrients, specifically, vitamins A, C, D, and E, decreased the risk of respiratory infections, such as the common cold and pneumonia, and shortened the duration of these illnesses.16 20–23 These nutrients are hypothesised to support the immune system as they play important roles in the production of antibodies, proliferation of lymphocytes, and reduction of oxidative stress.16 While previously, both specific micronutrient deficiencies as well as generalised malnutrition have been associated with immune dysfunction in the host, the viral pathogen itself may be affected by the nutritional deficiency as well.4 24 Multiple viruses, such as coxsackievirus and influenza, have been shown to develop increased virulence due to changes in their genomes as a consequence of replicating in a nutritionally deficient host (eg, deficiency in selenium).25 26 Selenium may be an important nutrient to consider, considering its role in immunity.16 27 Given our findings of protection from severe illness in those consuming a micronutrient-dense diet, our data support this hypothesis. We could not further explore individual nutrient levels in our study population because we did not have these data. Future studies with detailed information on plasma micronutrient levels are warranted to confirm our findings.Along with plant-based diets, individuals who reported following pescatarian diets had lower odds of severe COVID-19."

 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the most widely prescribed antihypertensives in the market. 6
 There is contradictory evidence that ACEi or ARBs may either worsen or improve COVID‐19 symptoms. The proposed mechanism is discussed below.ACE2 is a glycoprotein that is expressed in the kidney, intestine, endothelium, lungs, and heart. 7
 It is hypothesized to bind with the spiked glycoprotein in SARS‐Cov2. Once the binding occurs, SARS‐CoV2 can cause downregulation of ACE2 resulting in increased concentrations of angiotensin II causing severe lung injury."

Evidence:"Conclusions:
      Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as efficient protection against infection. The mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research. Trial registration:
      IRB no. : 0011873-2020-09. Implications:
      (1) Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and COVID-19. (2) Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significantly lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71%) versus former and nonsmokers (80%)."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In 2020, scientists started talking about a link between blood type and Covid. That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility. Yet no research so far has been able to pin down the molecular goings on that explain the mechanism behind why this might be so."

Evidence:"Findings were summarized in four categories: 1) epidemiology; 2) clinical findings and patients' management; 3) causes; and 4) recommendation regarding prevention or reduction of methanol poisoning during COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionThe recent outbreak is the largest methanol mass poisoning outbreak throughout Iran and the world in recent decades. The causes of methanol poisoning during the COVID-19 pandemic are intertwined, and most of them are modifiable by health policy makers. Building trust, educating and warning, as well as controlling and monitoring are three main recommendation for prevention or reduction of methanol poisoning.Keywords: Methanol, Poisoning, COVID-19, Pandemic1. IntroductionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that first appeared in December 2019 in China. Symptoms of the virus range from mild to severe disease, and in some cases can be fatal [1,2]. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health are still under study [3]."

Evidence:"Photograph: Photographer is my life./Getty ImagesJames TapperSun 14 Feb 2021 10.00 GMTLast modified on Mon 15 Feb 2021 10.52 GMTIs handwashing still an important way to reduce the spread of Covid-19?In the early days of the pandemic, public health experts emphasised handwashing as a way to prevent infection and the government launched a “Hands, Face, Space” campaign to encourage people to wash their hands, wear masks and keep 2 metres apart. Subsequent research has shown the biggest risk of Covid-19 transmission is through particles in the air.Why did we focus on handwashing?When little was known about Covid-19, researchers focused on fomites – surfaces such as handrails where the virus might be able to survive without a host for some time – because other diseases such as norovirus can be transmitted that way. How does Covid-19 spread?Surface transmission may happen, but speaking and coughing seem to play a much larger role, because we emit tiny aerosol water particles containing the virus. Indoors, those particles can linger for minutes or hours, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest last week that people wear two masks. It now says surface transmission is “not thought to be a common way that Covid-19 spreads”.Can handwashing prevent the spread of Covid-19?Although there is limited evidence that fomites do play a role, there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces. Public Health England put handwashing and surface cleaning at the top of updated guidance published earlier this month."

Evidence:"Several arguments suggest that nicotine is responsible for this protective effect via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Nicotine may inhibit the penetration and spread of the virus and have a prophylactic effect in COVID-19 infection. However, the epidemic is progressing throughout French territory and new variants (in particular the "English B1. 1.7 variant of SARS-COV-2") much more contagious run a risk of accelerating the epidemic in the population. The anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccines recently launched (or being evaluated) represent great hope in this health crisis, but trials were only able to show their effectiveness on symptomatic forms of SARS-COV-2 infection. On the one hand, the vaccination compaign for the entire population requires many months,which leaves many unprotected subjects waiting."

Evidence:"We will continue to investigate risks associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 and communicate publicly when we have more information. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19. They are being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19, and we authorized their temporary use during the COVID-19 pandemic for treatment of the virus in hospitalized patients when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible, through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The medicines being used under the hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine EUA are supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile, the national repository of critical medical supplies to be used during public health emergencies. This safety communication reminds physicians and the public of risk information set out in the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine healthcare provider fact sheets  that were required by the EUA. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia."

Evidence:"Therefore, monoclonal antibodies are therapeutic mechanisms that, by binding to the viral spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, impede viral invasion. For example, in the case of COVID-19, monoclonal antibodies are administered intravenously, and act similarly to the immune system.4,5In short, COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which presents specific receptors in its lipid membrane. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies may be an alternative treatment for COVID-19, as they may prevent the virus from entering cells and continuing to replicate; their therapeutic potential remains under research, as this treatment would help to reduce the number of hospital and intensive care admissions.Ethics approvalNot required.Conflicts of interestThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.FundingThis study has received no funding of any kind.

Evidence:"Several studies have shown that ribavirin has useful activity against SARS-CoV in vitro [11,12]. However, other studies have found that ribavirin did not inhibit the virus in vivo and did not promote the recovery of patients infected with SARS-CoV [13,14]. A retrospective cohort study showed that ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy improved survival at 14 days but not at 28 days in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection [4]. It should also be pointed out that a large, retrospective, multicentre study on different types of interferon with ribavirin to treat critically ill MERS cases did not improve survival [6]. Therefore, we should consider to remove the suggestion that patients with COVID-19 be treated with ribavirin.This study is limited by its single-centre, retrospective and non-randomised nature. Inevitably, selection bias cannot be completely ruled out."

In both cases, preventive effects of Echinacea against coronaviruses could be ascertained in controlled clinical settings.Neither of the referenced studies detected the newly occurring SARS-CoV-2, but only endemic coronavirus strains, as both were carried out prior to 2019. Conclusions pertaining to COVID-19 must be carefully considered, but are nevertheless important, since many people rely on immune support by herbal preparations these days, and it is important to give an estimation on evidence.All coronaviruses share structural similarities, including an enveloped membrane containing the genetic material, i.e., RNA and spike proteins for attachment to target cells. Echinacea broadly inhibits enveloped respiratory viruses at physiological concentrations in vitro and in vivo; however, the exact mode-of-action remains to be elucidated. Due to this broad range of activity, deactivation of all measured coronavirus types, such as alpha (CoV-229E) and beta strains (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2) by Echinacea, can realistically be assumed, and the results of this study point towards the clinical relevance of in vitro findings."
