Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Wait 30 minutes then check your child's temperature. See whether the medicine brings the child's fever below 104°F (40°C). If your child's fever is still 104°F (40°C) or higher and your child is uncomfortable, you might try a sponge bath. Follow these steps to give a sponge bath. Do not use cold water, ice, or rubbing alcohol, which will lower the child's body temperature too quickly."
Question:Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Treatable Dementia due to Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency. Brain Nerve. 2016 Apr;68(4):407-20. doi: 10.11477/mf.1416200414. 3 Kwok T, Wu Y, Lee J, et al. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of using B vitamins to prevent cognitive decline in older mild cognitive impairment patients [published online ahead of print, 2019 Nov 20]."
Question:Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"However, the effectiveness of this treatment can vary and it is not backed by scientific evidence. The process of using duct tape to remove a wart involves covering the wart with a piece of duct tape for several days. The idea behind this treatment is that the duct tape will cut off the wart’s supply of oxygen and nutrients, causing it to die and eventually fall off. It is difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for a wart to be removed using duct tape, as it can vary depending on the individual and the size and location of the wart. Some people may see results within a week, while others may not see any improvement for several weeks or even months. In general, it is recommended to use duct tape as a wart treatment for no longer than two months."
Question:Does duct tape work for wart removal? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Hold the area under cool (not cold) running water for about 10 minutes. If the burn is on the face, apply a cool, wet cloth until the pain eases. For a mouth burn from hot food or drink, put a piece of ice in the mouth for a few minutes. Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells. Don't break blisters."
Question:Should I apply ice to a burn? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Most noted re-pigmentation during the summer months. ​
Six patients experienced complete re-pigmentation of their vitiliginous skin, while 64% noted that the vitiligo stopped advancing after treatment. The combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 combined with the sun exposure produced better re-pigmentation than sun exposure or the vitamins alone. ​
The recommendation is that the vitamin and ultraviolet light treatment should continue as long as the white areas continue to re-pigment. Since at least 3 to 6 months were required for re-pigmentation to occur, patience is required for those utilizing this therapy. ​
(Since the underlying causes of the pigment loss in vitiligo may be associated with autoimmune mechanisms arising from the “leaky gut syndrome,” see the article on diet and arthritis in this website and follow the recommendations to optimize gut flora and function."
Question:Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Yoga is designed to use the breath in various ways and for specific purposes. It makes sense that yoga can lend a hand to those that struggle with asthma. Asthma is a chronic lung condition of the airways. A person with asthma has a sensitive airway that becomes inflamed when exposed to triggers.For example, an environmental trigger such as smoke. This makes breathing difficult and brings on coughing, wheezing, and even shortness of breath. Understandably, asthma sufferers are also prone to anxiety, stress, and even asthma attacks from such symptoms.The severity of the condition varies from person to person and although asthma is incurable, there are ways to manage the symptoms."
Question:Does yoga improve the management of asthma? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Conversely, if someone was burning with fever, not eating was believed to “cool” the patient down. Thankfully, starving is no longer recommended for treating any sickness. Proper nutrition – and even more important, proper hydration – is crucial in preventing and recovering from both fevers and colds. We know that staying hydrated is a key factor in fighting infections. However, the amount of food we need when we’re sick may be different for children and adults. In children: Feed a cold, feed a fever
      Dr. Jon S. Abramson, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Wake Forest Medical School, has found no medical evidence to support feeding a cold and starving a fever."
Question:Is starving a fever effective? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"She was taken to the operating room and underwent laparoscopic right ovarian detorsion and cystectomy. When you next see her after her surgery, she asks whether the cyst could grow back and what can be done to prevent future cyst formation. The answer is that she can begin taking BCPs. The same mechanism that "quiets down ovarian function" and suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis for contraception helps prevent cyst formation within the ovary. Combined contraceptives are recommended (unless estrogen is contraindicated) for women with recurrent symptomatic cysts, such as ruptured cysts or torsed cysts, and for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Monophasic preparations have been shown in some studies to prevent benign ovarian cysts more effectively than low-dose triphasic pills."

WHO antenatal care recommendations for a positive pregnancy experience
12 August 2021
 | Guideline
Download (735.3 kB)
Overview 
Evidence from a systematic review on antenatal zinc supplementation was evaluated as part of the World
Health Organization (WHO) antenatal care (ANC) guideline development process in 2016, and the following
recommendation on zinc supplementation was made: “Zinc supplementation for pregnant women is only
recommended in the context of rigorous research.” The Guideline Development Group (GDG) made this
recommendation because it felt that the evidence on the intervention was incomplete and that more research
was necessary.Since the publication of the systematic review, four additional randomized controlled trials have been published;
therefore, in April 2019, the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG) prioritized the WHO recommendation on
antenatal zinc supplementation for updating.

Zosia Kmietowicz1BMJEvening primrose oil and borage oil do not improve the symptoms of eczema, a review of the evidence has found. Furthermore, both can cause harm, mainly to the gastrointestinal tract. The authors, who published their review in the Cochrane Library, concluded that it would be hard to justify further studies on the treatments.1Some people take evening primrose oil and borage oil because they contain γ linolenic acid, which was once thought to … View Full Text

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"These joints take a hefty amount of the stress and pressure of our daily movements, and they perform a fairly good job to support our body weight. Just one misstep can put your ankle out of commission for quite some time.Getting an ankle brace for sprain compound can help you recover faster and heal better. They wrap around most or all of the foot, offering much needed support for the parts that normally serve as support for the body. Other types of medical supplies may be better for treating other types of ankle-related medical issues. Splint kits and boots can help with breaks or fractures.If you have been searching for ankle casting, splinting, or bracing products, then your search is over. OrthoTape.com is home to an array of splint kits, fracture boots, and ankle braces for sprain compounds."

no
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There are also other factors you can take into consideration to speed up the healing of acne and its scars. Many 'scar removing' products on the market contain vitamin E oil as one of their main ingredients, with medical experts proving its effective scar fading treatment for every type of scar, both old and new. How Does Using Vitamin E Oil For Acne Scars Work? Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin required for many daily functions of the body. One reason why using Vitamin E oil for acne scars has shown benefit is due to it's ability to regulate production of skin proteins such as collagen and elastin. It’s also known to help lighten scars and dark spots on the skin, whilst simultaneously promoting tissue repair."
Question:Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:""​Drop in blood pressurePresented at this year's American Society of Hypertension's Annual Scientific Meeting, the randomized, placebo-controlled study provided participants with either an ounce per day of Grana Padano PDO 12-month aged cheese or a placebo for two months. The results showed a 7-8 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure and a 5-7 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure, depending on in-office monitoring versus automated monitoring systems.No changes were seen in body mass index (BMI), blood lipids or blood sugar levels.Fermented milk productsThe invited review: Fermented milk as antihypertensive functional food, published in the June edition of the Journal of Dairy Science by L.M. Beltrán-Barrientos et al, looked at the available information related to the evaluation of fermented milk containing antihypertensive peptides by in vitro and in vivo studies.The authors note that these studies are required before a fermented functional dairy product may be introduced to the market.It states that although commercial fermented milks with antihypertensive effects exist, they are scarce and most are based on Lactobacillus helveticus​.Opportunity for product developmentThe paper notes that several fermented milk products are on the market, including Ameal (Calpis Co., Tokyo, Japan), Calpis (Calpis Co.), and Evolus (Valio, Helsinki, Finland), among others.The review says that a great opportunity is available for the development of functional dairy products with new lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that support heart health through blood pressure- and heart rate-lowering effects.The authors note that while these products attribute their antihypertensive effect to the bioactive peptides present in the fermented milk, they also contain minerals such as potassium and calcium, which have been demonstrated to have a positive effect on blood pressure.They say that more research on the subject is needed, but that the development of functional foods that support a healthy heart through lowering blood pressure offers new market opportunities.Source: Journal of Dairy Sciencedoi:10.3168/jds.2015-10054“Invited review: Fermented milk as antihypertensive functional food”Authors: L.M.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. “FDA’s approval of Dupixent demonstrates our commitment to approving new and innovative therapies for patients with skin disease,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Eczema can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available to patients, including those patients whose disease is not controlled by topical therapies.”
Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as “eczema,” which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy."

Evidence:"Yoga helps relieve chronic pain
Yoga can help people with arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraine, low back pain, and many other types of chronic pain conditions. A study published in Annals of Internal Medicine found that among 313 people with chronic low back pain, a weekly yoga class increased mobility more than standard medical care for the condition. Another study published at nearly the same time found that yoga was comparable to standard exercise therapy in relieving chronic low back pain. A meta-analysis of 17 studies that included more than 1,600 participants concluded that yoga can improve daily function among people with fibromyalgia osteoporosis-related curvature of the spine. Practicing yoga also improved mood and psychosocial well-being. What does a typical yoga session look like?"

Evidence:"Tested & Approved
Our Best Overall pick, the Verilux HappyLight Light Therapy Lamp, is compact, user-friendly, and effective. Our Best Budget pick, the Carex Light Therapy Lamp, has a no-frills design and wallet-friendly price point. Regular light therapy has been shown to alleviate symptoms of SAD, depression, and other mood disorders. And though it’s unclear how light therapy works, some suspect the bright light exposure may boost serotonin (the “happy chemical” that naturally occurs in our bodies) or reset our circadian rhythms. As you shop for light therapy lamps, consider size, style, light intensity, and brightness settings. A good light therapy lamp should suit your space, offer 10,000 lux of light exposure, and make it easy to adjust brightness when needed."

Evidence:"And that’s because it’s just a formal name for a very common pain relief medication.You've heard of Advil®, Excedrin®, and Aleve®, right? Well, those are all NSAIDs. And while they relieve all kinds of pain (muscle aches, menstrual cramps, rheumatoid arthritis, tension headaches, and so on), we’re going to focus on migraine headache pain today.What are the most common NSAIDs?Here's a brief list of the most common NSAIDs along with their brand names. We’re guessing you might recognize quite a few of these pain relievers.naproxen (generic Aleve®, Anaprox®, Naprelan®, and Naprosyn®)ibuprofen (generic Advil® and Motrin®)aspirin (generic Anacin®, Ascriptin®, Bayer®, Bufferin®, Excedrin®, Ecotrin®)celecoxib (generic Celebrex®)diclofenac (generic Cambia®)To see a full list of NSAIDs, click here.What’s the difference between naproxen, Naprosyn®, Aleve®, Anaprox®, and Naprelan®?There is none! Naproxen®, Naprosyn®, Aleve®, Anaprox®, and Naprelan® are just different names for the same medication. Because naproxen is the generic (non-branded) version, it’s often more affordable than the branded versions.Are NSAIDs prescription drugs or over-the-counter?Both."

yes

Evidence:"You pick your phone and call your best friend or ask Google for quick and effective ways to get rid of that pimple. And amongst all the suggestions that show up, one of the most common and bizarre, is applying toothpaste on pimples. First things first, understand that you can’t get rid of acne overnight. The skin’s healing process doesn’t work that way, however, a few ingredients can accelerate the healing process and reduce redness and inflammation. But applying toothpaste on pimples is definitely not one of them. It is one of the worst things you can apply on your skin after garlic and lemon."

no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"People with more severe pain experienced modest relief with the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. If you're wondering whether glucosamine and chondroitin might work for you, the answer is "it depends." If your osteoarthritis pain is moderate or significant, try taking both glucosamine and chondroitin for two to three months. If you find they ease your pain, it's reasonable to keep using them. If not, save your money. As always, if you choose to try these or any other vitamins, supplements, or alternative therapies, tell your doctor."

Evidence:"More specifically, the reflexology intervention appeared to reduce mean pain and fatigue scores earlier than aromatherapy massage (Week 1 vs. Week 2 for pain, Week 1 vs. Week 4 for fatigue) (p < 0.05). This short six-week preliminary study had no follow up; therefore, long term intervention effects are unknown. Overall, results suggest both aromatherapy massage and reflexology to be effective non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving RA-related pain and fatigue. Both forms of alternative therapy should be considered as a component of care for symptom management in patients with RA. Further research is needed to determine what other RA-related symptoms beyond pain and fatigue may benefit from aromatherapy massage and reflexology and what the long-term effects of therapy are.

Evidence:"The rest of the children were treated with lower humidity, at dosages more typically delivered in an ER or with a home humidifier.The researchers found that high humidity was no more effective than low humidity in the emergency department setting. "Our results suggest that the use of humidity in children with croup seen in emergency departments is not warranted," they concluded.Cool Night Air May Help CroupScolnik says the same is true for children with moderate to severe croup symptoms treated at home, even though humidifiers or the steamy bathroom treatment may appear to be useful.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the approach, telling parents through its web site to sit in a steamy bathroom with their child for 15 to 20 minutes. "Steam almost always works," the AAP public education statement on croup states.It may appear to work, Scolnik says, but it is more likely that a parent's efforts to comfort and calm the sick child are what really help. "Parents are doing all the right things when they sit in a steamy bathroom with a child with croup, and the setting is warm and comforting," he says. "But the humidity probably isn't adding much. "Wrapping the child in blankets and taking him outside if the air is cool may help, he says."

Evidence:"Using food or alcohol or withdrawing and isolating yourself from others are just a few examples. Replacing one of these with something positive like exercise can help you develop new coping strategies. The Link Between Exercise and Depression   
Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿
More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 
Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿
Of the participants, 75% showed either a therapeutic response or complete remission of symptoms compared to 25% who did not exercise."

If you develop a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, see your doctor:
Tell the doctor about your recent tick bite,
When the bite occurred, and
Where you most likely acquired the tick. People who have removed a tick sometimes wonder if they should have it tested for evidence of infection. Although some commercial groups offer testing, in general this is not recommended because:
Laboratories that conduct tick testing are not required to have the high standards of quality control used by clinical diagnostic laboratories.

Evidence:""I was stunned by that result." Zinc's been studied for years, and not all studies have pointed to a benefit, but that may be because of the dosage and composition of the lozenge used. Most recently, a meta-analysis published in 2017 by Harri Hemilä at the University of Helsinki concludes that 80 to 92 milligrams per day of zinc, given at the onset of cold symptoms, reduced duration of the common cold by 33%. The study finds that two different zinc compounds — zinc acetate and zinc gluconate — are both effective. And there's no evidence, the researchers say, that increasing those doses of zinc (to 100 milligrams per day or more) leads to any greater efficacy. Great news."

We have not shown a benefit of vitamin D on day-to-day asthma control,” Martineau said. The number of asthma patients with uncontrolled symptoms is significant. “[The disease in] over 50 percent of all asthma patients [is] not well-controlled, which results in symptoms like coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. In fact, in a recent survey we found that over 80 percent of patients limited simple activities like household chores and exercise at least once per week due to asthma,” Winders said.

Evidence:"Studies are conflicting about the effectiveness of Chitosan with weight loss in humans. Studies with animals were very promising, but when it came to human trials the evidence was not as strong. There are some studies that suggest the use of Chitosan with a calorie restricted diet may cause slightly more weight loss than groups which did not take Chitosan throughout the research. This effect, however, was not achieved without a calorie restricted diet, so it is important to understand that adding this ingredient to your routine with a goal of weight loss will be ineffective if you do not have a calorie restricted diet and exercise plan in place, and even if you do add Chitosan into your nutritional plan, the additional weight loss attributed to it may be slight, although considered statistically significant in some trials and insignificant in others. When the research was reviewed, and poorer quality studies were eliminated, Chitosan did indeed still show a slight benefit when it came to weight loss when taken between one to six months, although it was small. Chitosan may help you to reach your goals, but it is by no means a miracle fix, you will still need to put in a lot of hard work to obtain the goals that you want."
