Evidence:"Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Your child's doctor may tell you to use both types of medicine.In children under 3 months of age, call your child's provider first before giving them medicines.Know how much your child weighs. Then always check the instructions on the package.Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours.Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old.Do not give aspirin to children unless your child's provider tells you it is OK. A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most children will feel better when their temperature drops by even one degree.A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever.Lukewarm baths work better if the child also gets medicine. Otherwise, the temperature might bounce right back up.Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs."

Evidence:"Comment
The limited evidence from the short-duration randomized controlled trials suggests that supplementation with vitamins B6 or B12 or folic acid among either elderly cognitively intact individuals or those with dementia or cognitive impairment does not improve cognitive function as measured by a wide battery of tests. The 1 exception to this may be folic acid supplementation in people with both cognitive impairment and serum folate levels lower than 3 ng/mL (<6.8 nmol/L). However, any conclusions about the effect of folic acid treatment are greatly limited because there are only 3 trials with 39 people who received folic acid. Further clarification may be available soon because a large, 3-year trial of folic acid in elderly people with hyperhomocysteinemia has been presented at an international conference.52 The abstract, which has not yet been peer reviewed, preliminarily reported a net improvement in global cognitive function including memory, sensorimotor speed, and informational processing speed. Notably, in a minority of studies of both vitamin B12 and combinations of B vitamins that include vitamin B12 compared with placebo, the B vitamin treatment resulted in worse performance on a small number of cognitive tests. The clinical significance of this effect, though, is questionable, in that those receiving placebo had statistically significant improvements from baseline among these tests."

Evidence:"In most cases, migraine prevention or reduction of severity can be aided with a magnesium supplement. It is a natural element essential for our health and regarded as an extremely safe treatment option for most people, especially when compared to migraine medication which can come with a host of severe side effects. When it comes to preventing migraines, one of the most simple things you can do is regularly get plenty magnesium in your daily diet. Most people will need to add some magnesium rich foods into their diet to get the majority of their magnesium, and may require an additional supplement if suffering from migraines or live a lifestyle with high magnesium requirements.. Consider tracking your food for a few days on any popular tracking app and see if you’re getting adequate levels of magnesium and supplement accordingly using a quality magnesium supplement. The research into the use of magnesium in the prevention and treatment of migraine headaches is becoming stronger, and because the supplement is relatively safe and affordable it is well worth considering as a first measure of treatment and prevention."

Evidence:"Diet and exercise
Weight loss resulting from healthy eating  and increased physical activity enables muscle cells to use insulin and glucose more efficiently, thus lowering diabetes risk. Lack of exercise can cause muscle cells to lose their sensitivity to insulin, which controls levels of sugar in the blood. "Even if you don't lose weight, exercise will make you stronger and healthier," says endocrinologist Douglas Zlock, MD, medical director of the diabetes center at John Muir Health. "Healthy habits can definitely postpone the onset of diabetes even if they don't prevent it." The certified diabetes educators at John Muir Health are firm believers that those at risk for diabetes can develop a flexible care program with the help of a diabetes team. Important clinical trials have shown that exercise, healthy eating, and modest weight reduction can prevent diabetes."

The blockade by dupilumab of these key drivers of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)–mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of related diseases, including atopic dermatitis. MethodsWe performed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adults who had moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis despite treatment with topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Dupilumab was evaluated as monotherapy in two 4-week trials and in one 12-week trial and in combination with topical glucocorticoids in another 4-week study. End points included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, the investigator's global assessment score, pruritus, safety assessments, serum biomarker levels, and disease transcriptome. ResultsIn the 4-week monotherapy studies, dupilumab resulted in rapid and dose-dependent improvements in clinical indexes, biomarker levels, and the transcriptome."

Evidence:"Participants reported improvements in knee pain, self-reported physical function, and affect (expressed emotional responses); however, walking performance remained unchanged.39 In a different study, after seven yoga classes, the number of nights with insomnia (self-reported) was significantly improved in 13 women with OA in any joint.41 A case series of 14 people with symptomatic knee OA also showed yoga was associated with improved quality of life.35
Although these early studies point to the potential for improvement in physical and mental health after yoga, it is important to note that the improvements were limited to self-reported measures, and the exposure to yoga was relatively short and infrequent. Because self-reported function and actual performance are not well-correlated,42 it is important for research to include both types of measurements. Recently, we conducted a simple yoga trial in 38 women with symptomatic knee OA who completed 12 weeks of supervised yoga-based strengthening exercise three times a week.43 A unique element of our yoga program is that we selected yoga postures (eg, lunges, squats, stretches) that would minimize patients’ exposures to knee joint loads known to worsen structural disease in the knee.43 Our “biomechanical” yoga program (see Figure 1, below) improved pain, self-reported physical function, objective measures of mobility performance (eg, walking speed), and knee extensor and flexor strength. However, we observed no changes in physical fitness or knee mechanics during walking and yoga postures or in muscle activation after the yoga intervention.44
These findings show yoga can improve muscle strength in women with knee OA, which translates to improved mobility. Nonetheless, it is important to note that, in all of these early studies, including ours, the small samples and lack of comparison with a control group means we cannot be sure if enrollment in the study itself (that is, the attention and the researchers’ intention to address each patient’s chronic knee problems) is responsible for the improvements, rather than the yoga intervention. Controlled trials
A handful of studies have compared outcomes after a yoga intervention with those of a control group."

Evidence:"Although non-pharmacologic interventions play a role in headache management, most migraine patients seek relief with medication. Approximately 95 percent of patients with severe migraine take some medication (prescription or over-the-counter) for their headaches.2 A survey of patients with migraine indicated that they desire a medication that provides quick, sustained pain relief and also decreases the likelihood of recurrence.3 
Although injectable sumatriptan (Imitrex Statdose) appears to be effective in aborting migraine attacks, many patients are reluctant to self-administer an injection.4–6 Oral medication for the acute treatment of migraine is the most convenient route of administration but is often impractical because of the high association of nausea and vomiting with migraine attacks. Up to 92 percent of patients have experienced nausea during a migraine attack, and 50 to 68 percent also have vomited.3,7 In addition, the absorption of oral medications may be delayed or diminished because of the high prevalence of gastroparesis during the attack.8–10 
The recently approved intranasal forms of dihydroergotamine mesylate (Migranal) and sumatriptan (Imitrex) may help alleviate some of the aforementioned problems. The intranasal route of administration is less invasive than self-administration of an injection and offers the advantage of bypassing the need for gastric absorption. This article reviews these two intranasal forms of migraine medications and their role in the treatment of acute migraine. Dihydroergotamine Nasal Spray
Dihydroergotamine (DHE) has been used in the parenteral form for the treatment of acute migraine for many years."

SAD differs from major depression in that it occurs during a particular season, usually winter, with full remission for the rest of the year. About 5%¹ of the US population experience seasonal affective disorder. The condition is most common among females, those aged between 18 to 30, and those with a family history of depression. An effective way to treat SAD is with light therapy, which can help to relieve symptoms by regulating your biological clock.Have you considered clinical trials for Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?We make it easy for you to participate in a clinical trial for Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and get access to the latest treatments not yet widely available - and be a part of finding a cure.Check your eligibilityHow do lights help seasonal affective disorder?Limited exposure to sunlight is a key cause of seasonal affective disorder.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The medication combination chosen here addresses two mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology–triptan as a serotonin receptor agonist and naproxen as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The 3 doses were equally effective and well tolerated, suggesting that the lowest dose should be sufficient, though higher doses could be beneficial in older adolescents or to obtain more prolonged relief. Further, one wonders how each agent individually would have fared in comparison with the combination, especially in light of previous reports that each agent alone was ineffective in acute migraine. The present results suggest a synergism with the combination agent, which has also been shown to be effective in adults with acute migraine. In some migraine sufferers, ancillary symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia can be even more impairing than the headache itself. An ideal migraine treatment should abate those symptoms as well."

A variation on the classic internal tonic formula championed by American health care practitioner Harry Hoxsey in the earlier part of the 20th century
In a short article in HerbalGram, the peer-reviewed journal of the American Botanical Council, eminent botanist Dr. James Duke pointed out that 8 of the 9 herbs in this formula demonstrated antitumor activity in controlled laboratory tests, while 5 herbs had antioxidant qualities that he postulated as protectants against cancer. All of them, moreover, had antimicrobial properties against viral or bacterial infections. This is significant, since there are those who suggest that there is a correlation between the antibacterial properties of a herb and its antitumor activity. Who it’s for:
This is a product without an NPN that we sell only to our practitioners for particular use with patients who have degenerative conditions."

Evidence:"Some researchers suspect exercise alleviates chronic depression by increasing serotonin (the neurotransmitter targeted by antidepressants) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (which supports the growth of neurons). Another theory suggests exercise helps by normalizing sleep, which is known to have protective effects on the brain. There are psychological explanations, too. Exercise may boost a depressed person's outlook by helping him return to meaningful activity and providing a sense of accomplishment. Then there's the fact that a person's responsiveness to stress is moderated by activity. "Exercise may be a way of biologically toughening up the brain so stress has less of a central impact," Otto says."

Evidence:"If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and the skin will heal. After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol, iodine, or soap and water. Avoid Folklore Remedies such as covering the tick with petroleum jelly, or using heat to make the tick detach from the skin. You also do not want to squish the tick. Here is the reason: the bacteria that causes Lyme Disease (and the other tick borne diseases Ehrlichiosis  and Anaplasmosis) lives in the salivary glands of the tick. If you try to suffocate the tick by using petroleum jelly or try to burn or squish it,  the stress of such actions will cause the tick to regurgitate (they literally “throw up”) the infected saliva into the blood stream, which increases the risk of contracting a tick born disease."

Evidence:"For lice treatment Some people claim that a mayonnaise hair mask can help treat head lice, but there is no evidence-based research to prove this. Although the mayonnaise might make the lice temporarily inactive, it will not kill them. How to use a mayonnaise hair mask At home, a person can combine one or more ingredients to make a mayonnaise hair mask. A basic mayonnaise hair mask requires only one ingredient: 1 cup of mayonnaise.A person can buy mayonnaise from a grocery store or online. A person who has an allergy to egg yolks can purchase eggless mayonnaise or make their own mayonnaise at home. However, in order for a product to be true mayonnaise, it must contain 65% vegetable oil and have one or more egg yolk-containing ingredients."

Evidence:"Zinc treatment had no effect on the severity or duration of cold symptoms, nor did it have an effect on the proportion of infected volunteers who developed clinical colds [46].Non—influenza-related viral respiratory tract infections in the United States represent a total economic impact of $40 billion annually, spread over the 500 million colds contracted annually [47]. The seemingly benign common cold represents an economic cost far greater than that of many other clinical conditions [47] and warrants continued research designed to reduce incidence and morbidity. After 20 years of research on the use of zinc to treat colds, consensus has not been reached. This review suggests that valid studies are few in number and have not shown zinc lozenges to be an effective treatment for the cold. Acknowledgments

Evidence:"— the Neolithic period. Although people have adorned themselves with copper since prehistory, the marketing of copper bracelets as a treatment for arthritis pain appears to date back only to the 1970s. Miner Pain Relief Proponents of copper bracelets often cite the research of Werner Hangarter (1904–1982), a German doctor of internal medicine. Hangarter evangelized for copper’s therapeutic possibilities after hearing that copper miners in Finland seldom developed rheumatism while laboring in the copper-rich environment of the mines. In the 1950s, he began treating patients suffering from a variety of rheumatic ailments — including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — with injections of copper in a salicylic acid solution. The results were dramatic: patients showed “rapid and persistent remission of fever, alleviation of pain, [and] increased mobility.”  Hangarter published several papers on his work, and the alternative-medicine movement popularized his ideas."

Evidence:"How Is Athlete's Foot Treated? Over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal creams, sprays, or powders may solve the problem if it is mild. More serious infections may need prescription medicine, either topical (applied to skin) or in pill form.

Evidence:"Not all probiotics can ease diarrhea, though, and some help only certain types of diarrhea. So which ones can help, and when?Kids and DiarrheaSome of the best proof that probiotics work comes from studies of diarrhea in children, especially when it's caused by rotavirus. Probiotics might cut bouts of infectious diarrhea by half a day to about 2 days.Some research shows that the bacteria strains most likely to help are Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, although other strains might be useful. A mix of a few different probiotics may also treat this type of diarrhea.Diarrhea From AntibioticsAntibiotics kill the germs in your body that make you sick, but they also kill some of the good bacteria. This can upset the normal balance in your intestines, leading to diarrhea.Studies of children and adults show that you may cut your chances of having diarrhea if you take probiotics before and during treatment and several days after stopping your antibiotics. Saccharomyces boulardii and some strains of lactobacillus can work.Travelers’ DiarrheaWhen you're away from home, you may get diarrhea when you eat or drink contaminated food or water.There's no hard proof that probiotics work for this problem."

Medications
Many types of medications are available for arthritis pain relief. Most are relatively safe, but no medication is completely free of side effects. Talk with your doctor to formulate a medication plan for your specific pain symptoms. What to do
Over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can help relieve occasional pain triggered by activity your muscles and joints aren't used to — such as gardening after a winter indoors.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The meta-analysis suggested that music therapy and music medicine reduce depressive symptoms, although music medicine has a larger effect. Conclusions
This review suggests that music therapy and music medicine reduce depressive symptoms. Some specific music therapy methods may be more effective than others, such as recreative music therapy and guided imagery and music. There is not strong evidence that characteristics of music-based interventions influence their effectiveness. Some specific music therapy methods may be more effective than others to reduce symptoms of depression, such as recreative music therapy and guided imagery and music. Strengths and limitations

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In the study done by Gupta et al. which investigated the relationships between serum vitamin D, asthma severity and airway function, vitamin D was associated with asthma severity and pulmonary function and vitamin D supplementation had been useful in the treatment of pediatric severe therapy-resistant asthma [50]. Another study was found that vitamin D levels in children with asthma is associated with more severe disease [51]. Poon also has confirmed these results and believes that vitamin D deficiency leads to the development of severe asthma and if vitamin D deficiency is corrected, it will play a protective role against the progression of asthma and this may simply be the most effective therapy [52]. In Brehm’s study even though there was no significant different in terms of vitamin D deficiency between cases and controls; most patients with severe asthma had vitamin D deficiency which implicates that vitamin D deficiency is correlated with asthma severity [46]. Another study showed that vitamin D deficiency is associated with asthma severity [27]."

Evidence:"Rice, soy, almond or other plant-based beverages, even when fortified, are not appropriate as a breastmilk substitute as they are nutritionally incomplete for infants. There is no evidence that soy-based formula will prevent your child from developing an allergy. Soy-based infant formulas should only be used as an alternative to cow milk-based formula if your baby has galactosemia (a rare disorder that will affect how your baby’s body processes simple sugar) or if your baby cannot consume dairy-based products for cultural or religious reasons. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure which formula is best for your child. If your baby has allergies, or if allergies run in the family, see below for specific recommendations about when and how to introduce allergenic foods (such as eggs or peanuts). Introducing solid foods
At about 6 months, most babies are ready for solid foods."

Evidence:"[Henkel R. Andrologia 2019]ConclusionA Cochrane review of the available literature in 2014 found a statistically significant improvement in pregnancy and live birth rates in couples where men were taking a regimen of antioxidants. These findings have been questioned by more recent studies such as the relatively small MOXI trial. Clearly, larger randomized trials which contain all of the supplements felt to potentially beneficial (the MOXI trial did not include L-carnitine) are needed to better elucidate the impact of these therapies on fertility outcomes. Until that time, the majority of evidence seems to point to a potential benefit of antioxidants in the management of male infertility. No specific antioxidant formula has been proven to be more effective than the others in clinical trials. Relatively cost-effective options are available, and the use of basic antioxidants seems to be safe in most men if excessive amounts are not used.APPROACHES TO USING ANTIOXIDANTS IN MENThere 3 main approaches that clinicians can use for antioxidants in managing male infertility: 1) Recommending antioxidants for all men with fertility issues 2) Reserve antioxidants for men who have certain significant risk factors (such as tobacco use or pyospermia) 3) Only use antioxidants if elevated levels of oxidative stress are found upon testing (as discussed above)None of these approaches has been proven superior at this point in time."
