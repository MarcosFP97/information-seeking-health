Trials and tribulations: challenges conducting the BRACE trial during a pandemic. In this webinar, we heard from Prof Nigel Curtis, the Chief Principal Investigator of the BRACE trial of BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19, about the challenges of running the BRACE trial during a pandemic. The BRACE trial is an international randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of BCG vaccination in reducing incidence and severity of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. The trial has been in progress for over 12 months, and has reached over 6,000 healthcare workers across Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil, Chile, the United States and the United Kingdom."

RCPCH publishes new advice on use of ibuprofen and COVID-19
Following recommendations made by experts at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Alder Hey are recommending that parents can treat symptoms of fever or pain related to COVID-19 with either paracetamol or ibuprofen. The Commission on Human Medicines’ Expert Working Group on coronavirus (COVID-19) has concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contracting or worsening of COVID-19. Catrin Barker, Chair of the RCPCH Medicines Committee and Chief Pharmacist at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital said:
“Our advice to parents is that either paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to treat their child if they have symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and headache, and should follow NHS advice if they have any questions or if symptoms get worse. Parents should always read the patient information when taking over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, and follow the instructions on how to take the medicines.”
To manage symptoms of fever:
Keep your child well hydrated – give plenty of fluids to drink. Tepid sponging is not recommended. Children with fever should not be under-dressed or over-wrapped."

Evidence:"readmore04/6Can drinking green tea prevent or cure COVID-19?According to experts, green tea contains health-promoting polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has anti-viral effects against single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like Zika, hepatitis C, influenza (flu), dengue, and others, as reported by Healthline.The SARs-CoV-2 virus is also an ssRNA virus, which is why experts believe green tea could have potential effects on the coronavirus. A test-tube study found that green tea extracts may fight off COVID-19 infections by damaging the spike protein, curbing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall presence of the virus. But there is no conclusive study that suggests drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. However, concentrated extracts like EGCG can be used as a natural home remedy to treat COVID-19. readmore05/6What has research foundA 2021 study published in the journal 'RSC Advances' found that gallocatechin - a compound found in green tea - may help in the development of a drug that can combat SARS-CoV-2. The research conducted by Dr Suresh Mohankumar, an academician at Swansea University told ANI, "Nature's oldest pharmacy has always been a treasure of potential novel drugs and we questioned if any of these compounds could assist us in battling the Covid-19 pandemic?"

Evidence:"For COVID-19, this approach is supported by early scientific evidence and a study conducted in Hong Kong during the SARS-1 crisis (a closely related virus). This empirical evidence also indicates that associated risks are very low. In fact, the procedure is a standard plasma transfusion, where the plasma meets all criteria for safety.In addition to direct transfusion, convalescent plasma can also be used as the starting material for later industrial manufacturing of specific immuno-globulins (medicinal products). The development of such industrially manufactured product would be enhanced by the availability of a substantial inventory of donated convalescent plasma, meeting high standards of quality and safety.Widely available in a short timeConvalescent plasma transfusions can be made available in the short term through the existing organisational capacities in the public/NGO blood services in the EU Member States. In more than half of EU Member States, blood services are preparing for collection. In some EU Member States the collection and supply has already started ."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It is estimated that pneumococcal pneumonia causes 10,000 hospital admissions in Spain every year. During the COVID-19 pandemic, between 7% and 11% of coinfections have been recorded in patients with COVID-19, in which the flu virus was one of the most frequent. Elderly people, especially those who live in assisted living facilities, have been a very vulnerable population during the COVID-10 pandemic, mainly due to the rapid propagation of the virus, which is associated with a high number of deaths. Patients over 80 years who received mechanical ventilation had a mortality rate of 90%, which demonstrates the vulnerability of this population. The World Health Organization recommends keeping vaccination programmes against influenza, pneumococcus and whooping cough active, at the same time as implementing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures can help to reduce occupancy of hospital beds, therefore making more resources available to treat patients with COVID-19."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There’s some evidence that fever-reducing drugs interfere with the body’s natural defenses against infection. At least one study found that symptoms lasted longer when patients took fever-reducing drugs — though we don’t know if this is the case in individuals with COVID-19. And since both NSAIDs and acetaminophen have potential side effects, you should consult your own healthcare provider about which fever-reducing medication to take or whether you should take medication at all. Cough is another common symptom. For a wet cough with mucus, you’ll want an expectorant that contains guaifenesin (for example, Robitussin or Mucinex). For a dry cough, try a cough suppressant that contains dextromethorphan (for example, Delsym)."
Question:Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no
Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Non-medical masks are generally made of cloth that is unlikely to degrade from regular wear or cleaning. Individuals should dispose of a mask if it is damaged in any way. Fact check: No evidence mask wearing will cause bacterial pneumonia | Reuters

Authorized COVID-19 medical devices: Overview - Canada.ca
Myth: Masks don’t actually work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and are incapable of stopping viral transmission. Fact: The use of masks to reduce the emission of respiratory particles – source control – has been part of medical science for years. With COVID-19, masks are effective at blocking most large droplets, but can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles. They can also help prevent the inhalation of these respiratory particles."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Suman Harpriya, a legislator in the northeastern state of Assam claimed that cow urine and cow dung could be effective in treating COVID-19. "Coronavirus is an airborne disease and it can be cured by using 'gaumutra'(cow urine) and cow dung," Haripriya had said. "Performing yagna with ancient Vedic rituals of Hindu religion would help in killing the deadly coronavirus in the air," Sanjay Gupta, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Laksar area in Haridwar said. Our community members also reached out to us on our WhatsApp Fact Check Number asking us to verify this claim. Claim:  Drinking Cow Urine Can Ward Off COVID-19  Fact Check  A study titled "Evaluation of antidiabetic, antioxidant effect and safety profile of Gomutra ark in Wistar albino rats" has revealed that cow's urine has a significant anti-diabetic effect which is comparable to standard drug glibenclamide. This activity may be due to the presence of sulfur in the cow urine or due to its antioxidant activity.But beyond that, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that cow urine can cure or prevent COVID-19 or any other disease."

no

Evidence:""If we can slow the spread of the illness, then the hope is that even if the total number of cases is as high, the pace is slow enough such that our hospitals and health systems can continue to accommodate the people who need treatment. "During the 1918 influenza pandemic, approximately 22% of the population in Sydney avoided infection due to social distancing measures like closing theaters, canceling classes and quarantining ill patients. These interventions could prove vital for mitigating the coronavirus pandemic.However, social distancing does not mean avoiding all activities outside of your home.A woman uses hand sanitizer at Los Angeles International Airport, March 12, 2020, one day before a US flight travel ban hits 26 European countries amid ongoing precautions over the Coronavirus.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images“We don’t want to become hermits. We don’t want to get into our homes, lock the door and crawl under the bed,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.For activities such as going to the gym, people can try to go at off-hour times, sanitize commonly used equipment, and practice proper hand-washing routines, according to Schaffner. “What we’re asking people to do is look into your own lives and figure out what you’re doing and not doing that bring you all together closely, and begin to avoid those activities,” he said.What to know about Coronavirus: How it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained What to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptomsTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide:  Coronavirus mapMost importantly, social distancing measures for COVID-19 should not be discriminatory practices, said Schaffner. “If we should get angry at anybody or discriminate against anything, it would be the virus."

Correction
Error in Visual Abstract
Key PointsQuestion 
    Does hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir, administered as a 9-day course, prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization in patients with COVID-19?Findings 
    In this trial that included 685 patients, rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir were not significantly different compared with those who received placebo.Meaning 
    These findings may inform COVID-19 treatment guidelines for outpatients with COVID-19 and demonstrate that large-scale outpatient clinical trials of repurposed drugs can be successfully completed in low-income settings during the pandemic. Abstract
Importance 
    Data on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 in developing countries are needed.Objective 
    To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting.Design, Setting, and Participants 
    This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil. Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Ayurvedic medicine may be a helpful complement to Western medicine, and may not actively cause harm in some cases, but it should not be consumed as a cure for COVID-19. Instead, traditional prevention measures such as wearing masks and social distancing, should be followed to prevent infections. Ayurveda is ancient Indian medical system that focuses on natural, holistic approaches to physical and mental health. Currently, there is no evidence to indicate that Ayurvedic medicine cures or prevents COVID-19. Similar claims for Ayurvedic cures have been made in the past for other infectious diseases with no known cure, such as HIV/AIDS, without any reliable evidence. Such bold claims should always be treated with caution."

Evidence:"However, UV light exposure can be effective against different strains of airborne viruses such as COVID-19 on the electronic devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. However, each light based inactivation strategy has its pros and cons which should be carefully considered in designing a new microbial control strategy.1.1. Goal and scope of the studyThe role and availability of PPE kits is an important factor in combating the COVID-19 virus. The necessities of PPE kits have increased exponentially, as more and more countries are facing this pandemic, which has created a temporary shortage of PPE kits in many developing countries. This shortage has affected the morale of corona warriors, as more than 25k health workers have been infected from this virus. On the same time, if the used PPE kits were not scientifically handled and disposed, it will impose a threat to terrestrial, human health and marine ecosystems."

Evidence:"Some people swear that putting Vicks VapoRub on the souls of the feet and covering them with a towel or socks gets rid of a cough overnight. At least this isn’t likely to do any harm. However, promoting eucalyptus essential oil as a preventative or treatment for COVID-19 infections is not harmless because a belief that this can ward off infection may distract from the importance of physical distancing. The Food and Drug Administration in the US has sent warning letters to companies selling essential oils that “are misleadingly presented as safe or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.” These claims have now been removed from websites but posts still circulate about the benefits of eucalyptus oil vapours offering protection against viral infection. There is no evidence for this, but that does not mean that a proper controlled trial is not worth pursuing. After all, that is the only way to separate anecdote from reputable science."

Evidence:"“Based on the information that is being reported, we’re concerned that many of us are using alcohol and other substances to ease the pain and isolation caused by the pandemic,” says Catherine Murtagh-Schaffer, a Lee Health physician assistant who serves as the program lead for the opioid disorder treatment and substance abuse response team. “The concern is that long after the pandemic passes, people will have developed excessive drinking habits that lead to alcohol addiction while they're isolating at home,” Murtagh-Schaffer explains. “Besides the negative physical health associations, excessive alcohol use may lead to or worsen existing mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression, which may themselves be increasing during the pandemic.”
Hurting Your Immune System
Chronic alcohol consumption poses significant risks during COVID-19, potentially making people more vulnerable to disease, Murtagh-Schaffer says. “Alcohol can impair the body’s immune system, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and impair sleep, which is critical to maintaining the immune system. Also, people with substance use disorders are more likely to develop  COVID-19 and experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, according to the research.”
Another risk associated with drinking too much alcohol is that people tend to let their guard down about distancing, hand-washing and other safety protocols, she adds. How much alcohol is too much?"
Question:Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived. “Climate comes into play because it affects the stability of the virus outside the human body when expelled by coughing or sneezing, for example,” says Miguel Araújo, who studies the effects of environmental change on biodiversity at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, Spain. “The greater the time the virus remains stable in the environment, the greater its capacity to infect other people and become epidemic. While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”A recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hopeHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics. Araújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world. “It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says."
Question:Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"The receptor-ligand complexes of the turmeric compounds and drugs used in experimental Covid-19 therapies were studied by Emirik (2020) in terms of docking scores and the binding free energy of protein–ligand complexes. Their results indicated that the turmeric spice can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins and can be used as a therapeutic or protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting key proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to computational modeling and simulations studies by Saadat et al. (2020) the interaction and stability of the docked keto and enol forms of curcumin with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were verified by molecular dynamics simulations, free energy binding, and interaction energy. Similarly, Suravajhala, Parashar et al. (2020) found that curcumin possesses an antiviral protein binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 proteins."

Activists Claim A Vegetarian Diet Will Prevent COVID-19 Deaths

News Staff
   A group of vegetarian activists argue that the COVID-19 Omicron variant is good reason for people to adopt a plant-based diet.Papers by members of the Physicians Committee have correlated giving up meat to reduced risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. The authors of the new editorial in European Journal of Clinical Nutrition cite data touting the benefits of a plant-based diet for COVID-19, like one observational paper which claimed that a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a 9% lower risk of COVID-19 infection and a 41% lower risk of severe COVID-19. Another exploratory paper claimed that health care workers following a plant-based diet who were exposed to COVID-19 patients had a 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19.Confounders are numerous but they authoritatively note that Okinawa, Japan is a “Blue Zone” where people live longer and healthier lives because, the authors say, they are eat more sweet potatoes, soy, and green leafy vegetables. Okinawa has a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than Tokyo and they link that to less meat but there is no control because Okinawans are also more likely to be poorer than residents of Tokyo and so can't afford meat - the poverty rate is double that of the mainland. Because Okinawa is more poor, 30 percent live in poverty, COVID-19 mortality may be under-counted."

Evidence:"The use of ARBs was not associated with a lower risk for COVID-19 hospitalization for either group. Also, neither ARBs nor ACE inhibitors were associated with a lower mortality risk in people hospitalized with COVID-19. “While not yet actionable, these findings provide an impetus to test whether this common, inexpensive class of drugs can mitigate the impact of the virus,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines Jr. Professor of Medicine at Yale and director of the Yale New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research. Krumholz is co-senior author of the study, along with Dr. Deneen Vojta, executive director of research and development for the Minnesota-based company UnitedHealth Group. Krumholz said a large-scale clinical trial is being prepared to examine the potential role of ACE inhibitors in preventing the most severe consequences of COVID-19."

Evidence:"Smoking makes it harder to fight illness and to get better from lung infections. A person who smokes is more likely to get very sick from COVID-19.5
Smoking may keep the body’s system that fights illness from working right. People who smoke cigarettes now, or who smoked in the past, are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The relationship between using e-cigarettes or vaping products and COVID-19 is uncertain.3
A recent study found that among teenagers and young adults who were tested for COVID-19, those who had used e-cigarettes were more likely to be infected than those who did not use e-cigarettes. The study was representative of young people nationwide. Early studies show that, like cigarette smoke, the aerosol from e-cigarettes may irritate people’s lungs."

Evidence:"Getty ImagesIn a new study, researchers report that people with type O blood appear to be at lower risk for contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.In a June study, researchers concluded that people with type A blood have a higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.In March, a study from China concluded that people with type A blood may have a higher risk of contracting the new coronavirus than people with type O.The experts add that past research has shown some connection between blood type and illnesses such as the stomach flu, as well as the risk of stroke and cognitive impairment.All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.A new study indicates that people with type O blood have a lower risk of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 than people with other blood types.The researchers also noted that people with type O blood are less likely to develop a serious illness if they do have the virus. The findings are similar to a study published in June where researchers concluded that people with type A blood were associated with having a 45 percent higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.Those researchers studied 1,900 people in Spain and Italy who were seriously ill with COVID-19 and compared their results with 2,000 people who were not sick.In March, a study out of China suggested that people with type A blood might be more susceptible to getting the virus and people with type O blood might have more protection against the virus.The reports have some experts worried that people with type A blood might panic or worry and that people with type O blood might let their guard down or get too complacent. “These results can’t be used to lessen the serious precautions that everyone needs to take, regardless of their blood type,” Dr. Mary Cushman, MSc, a hematologist and professor at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, said in March.“Someone on social media this weekend wondered if the type O people in families should be the ones sent out for shopping, for instance,” Cushman told Healthline. “We definitely don’t want people thinking they can be protected and don’t have to take precautions because they are type O.”What the March study reportedThe March study came out of Wuhan, China, where the first known cases of COVID-19 were discovered.In the study, scientists looked at the blood types of 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared that with the blood types of the general population in that region.They found that in the normal population, type A was 31 percent, type B was 24 percent, type AB was 9 percent, and type O was 34 percent.In those with the virus, type A was 38 percent, type B was 26 percent, type AB was 10 percent, and type O was 25 percent.The researchers concluded that “blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups."

Evidence:"Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%–95% alcohol (≥60% ethanol or ≥70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Consequently, we argue that research on behavior change during the pandemic should control for the pandemic trajectory. The associations between the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and handwashing behavior are consistent with TMT [22, 23], which suggests that frequency of protective health behaviors may be lower when mortality information is not salient in focal attention. Thus, even if COVID-19 morbidity and mortality cases accumulate and individuals are still being regularly exposed to respective mortality information, lower rates of handwashing may be observed. However, increases in recent cases may increase the salience of COVID-19 morbidity, resulting in spikes in handwashing behaviors.The patterns of associations between the individual-level variables and handwashing adherence are similar to those found in other research. Earlier studies indicated that handwashing (and other COVID-19 preventive behaviors) was more prevalent among women than among men [3, 7, 8], among older participants, and among those with higher self-reported economic status [8]. Although we found no studies testing associations between exposure to handwashing information and frequency/adherence to handwashing, knowledge about correct steps in washing hands (most likely obtained via exposure to respective information) was related to higher handwashing frequency in earlier research [8]."

Evidence:"Finally, although our study provides an important perspective in COVID-19 care, our findings remain observational. All things considered, our data may suggest that the effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 could be mediated by nicotine rather than whole tobacco smoke. Nicotine can modulate the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (29–31), which SARS-CoV-2 uses for cellular entry (32–34). This in turn modulates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (35). Hence, we hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 alters the control of the nicotine receptor through acetylcholine. This would explain why previous studies also identified an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity (1, 3, 6)."

Evidence:"Whole plant cannabis extracts have also been shown to reduce blood coagulation in animal models; it is known that many of the negative systemic effects of COVID-19 appear to be related to altered coagulation, so it is possible that cannabis may be useful in managing these sequelae. Can medicinal cannabis help to prevent or treat COVID-19? Prevention
To date, the range and scope of verifiable research data linking cannabinoids with COVID-19 prevention is highly limited; however, novel approaches to the prevention of COVID-19 include a single study examining the possibility of incorporating CBD into oral solutions, such as mouthwashes and throat gargling liquids, with a view to ‘lowering or modulating ACE2 levels in high-risk tissues’. Studies have found that ACE2 levels change during the progression of COVID-19 and therefore the ability to modulate these levels becomes particularly important as ACE2 has been shown to be essential for lung function in animal models of SARS viruses. Reducing severity and impact
In analyses of COVID-19 there has been a significant degree of interest in the phenomenon of cytokine storm syndrome, wherein too many cytokine proteins are released in the body: these proteins can attack the lungs and overwhelm the immune system with hyperinflammation. Early evidence has tentatively indicated that CBD and THC may be beneficial in the treatment of patients whose bodies’ inflammatory response has become pathogenic."

Evidence:"The Women’s is sharing the latest advice from trusted medical sources to help inform our patients. Breastfeeding is both a powerful bonding tool, and a helpful way to protect babies from a variety of illnesses. If you are breastfeeding or giving breastmilk to your baby, and have been diagnosed with COVID-19, deemed a close contact, or have recovered from the virus, the Women’s advises you to continue to breastfeed unless you are feeling too unwell. If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and feeling too unwell to breastfeed, we encourage you to regularly express milk for your baby. Maternal antibodies, produced by your body when you are exposed to COVID-19, are actually beneficial to babies, and are passed on to your child via breastmilk. According to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, there is also evidence of maternal antibodies being passed onto baby via breastmilk following a full course of a COVID-19 vaccination."

Inhaled steroids may reduce risk of death from COVID-19 in asthma patients
				by 
					Ms Helen Johnson
					05 March 2021
Study shows severe asthma is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19, but inhaled steroids may reduce mortality. A recent study has found that adult asthma patients are more likely to go to critical care than patients without a known lung condition, and those with severe asthma have a higher risk of death. The analysis, led by Imperial and published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, looked at patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, comparing those with a known lung condition and those without, to investigate the outcomes for the two groups. “This study has implications for the millions of people in the UK with asthma” Dr Chloe Bloom Lead author
Asthma is a prevalent condition in the UK with 5.4 million people currently receiving treatment (Asthma UK). Typically, patients may use inhalers containing inhaled steroids to help manage their asthma. Previous studies have not found a clear pattern that links the risk of death from COVID-19 to having an underlying lung condition and inhaled steroid use."

Evidence:"Please note: Immunodeficiency UK does not have detailed information on the levels of anti-Covid-19 neutralising antibodies in the different IG products that are available to patients. Posted April 2021
The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as coronavirus / Covid-19) is caused by a zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from animals to humans; similar to other coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. At first it was unclear whether circulating antibodies to other coronaviruses in immunoglobulin products would be effective against Covid-19. This was an important consideration for people with immune deficiencies as their health depends on treatment with immunoglobulin preparations that need to contain neutralising antibodies against pathogens in the environment. A report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases,(1) published in December 2020, states that initially 54 intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations from plasma collected in Europe and the USA were tested and, although they contained antibodies to coronaviruses, none were specific to the new SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus and cross-neutralisation did not occur. This meant they did not offer any protection against Covid-19."

Evidence:"Scientists around the world are currently assessing if mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission, but so far there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitoes are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses in this family, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said. Hill has a few messages to help inform and allay fears:
While research is still ongoing into primary routes of transmission, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a “respiratory virus” and is primarily transmitted by “aerosol” route; sneezing/coughing and touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your face. Although it has been detected at low levels in the blood, there is no evidence it can be transmitted via bite from a mosquito."

  Hand sanitizer is selling out in stores over coronavirus fears, but doctors say you’re better off washing your hands 
Tito’s Vodka isn’t meant to be used as a hand sanitizer ingredient. As people worried about contracting or spreading the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have cleaned retailers such as Costco

        out of hand-sanitizing gels, wipes and household cleaners, some folks have also been turning to do-it-yourself hand sanitizer formulas that have been going viral online, which generally call for combining two-thirds of a cup of 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or ethanol to kill the germs, and one-third of a cup of aloe vera gel to protect your skin from drying out. But some misinformed individuals have also been looking into making sanitizers with liquor, such as Everclear grain alcohol and Tito’s Handmade Vodka, and taking their queries (and dubious success stories) to Google

        US:TWTR. That even rubbed Tito’s the wrong way, as the spirits maker shared the following PSA from its official Twitter account on Thursday in response to a customer who claimed to have made hand sanitizer from its vodka: “Per the CDC, hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol. Tito’s Handmade Vodka is 40% alcohol, and therefore does not meet the current recommendation of the CDC,” it read."

Evidence:"Moreover, other antivirals have been examined in COVID-19. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), demonstrated inhibition of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Early during the pandemic, the available data for the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 was controversial and varied from studies with clearly negative results to more favorable efficacy. Early RCTs [6–8] reports on the management of COVID-19 in-patients with combination LPV/r or placebo did not show a beneficial effect on mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, the SOLIDARITY trial was stopped due to preliminary results showing that LPV/r produce no reduction in the mortality of COVID-19 hospitalized patients when compared to standard of care [9]. Second, ribavirin (RBV), a guanosine analogue and a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has been evaluated in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and later had high half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 109.50 μM and selectivity index against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells [10]."

Understanding Turmeric & Echinacea COVID-19 Warnings
Some experts are now warning that several natural medicines, includingÂ turmeric,Â echinacea,Â licorice, and others might interfere with the bodyâs immune and inflammatory response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Make sure patients understand these warnings. Turmeric, echinacea, and licorice have anti-inflammatory properties similar to NSAIDs. Several months ago, Franceâs health minister claimed that taking NSAIDs might increase the risk of severe COVID-19. But currently there isnât any strong evidence supporting this claim â experts still believe that NSAIDs can be considered for use in patients with COVID-19, just as they would be for any other fever or infection. This new warning about natural medicines is also coming out of France, for similar reasons to the NSAIDs warning."

The drink is not a cure for the coronavirus and there have been deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Israel.THE FACTS: Coronavirus deaths have been on the rise globally and in Israel. As of Thursday, Israel had confirmed more than 6,360 cases of the virus and 33 deaths.Posts circulating on social media falsely state that “the action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus, completely eliminates it from the body.” The false claim was shared widely across Facebook and on WhatsApp. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, told The Associated Press that like this claim, nothing should be presumed to prevent or treat unless it has gone through clinical trials. “There are no herbal remedies I would recommend for COVID-19,” she said."
