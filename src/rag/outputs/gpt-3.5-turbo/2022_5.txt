Evidence:"It is a major part of the healing process, after which a blood clot forms over the extraction site. The use of tea bags for bleeding tooth extraction is popular in oral surgery to stop bleeding. Green and black tea contain tannins, which are natural chemicals found in caffeinated tea. The tannins contribute to the tea’s bitter flavour. The tannins in green or black tea that has caffeine have astringent capabilities and stimulate further blood clotting."
Question:Do tea bags help to clot blood in pulled teeth?

Evidence:"Or are crystals truly just pretty objects that offer up some sort of placebo effect that can convince us something more magical is at play?First, let’s consider the primary argument for crystals as healing conduits. In short, the belief is that certain stones can help guide healing energy into the body, while ushering out negative, disease-causing energy. This supposedly occurs through your body’s energy field, or chakra; the energy is variably referred to as “qi,” “prana,” or “universal energy,” according to Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator at McGill Office for Science & Society in Montréal.Crystals are often incorporated into practices like reiki, a Japanese form of energy healing, and in specific crystal-healing practices like “crystal surgery,” wherein a practitioner uses crystals as tools for “operating” on the body’s energy field (don’t worry, it’s not an invasive practice—no scalpel required). In these treatments, practitioners attempt to “unblock” areas of our energy field that are “stuck.”But it’s not so easy to measure whether such bodily energy exists in the first place, Jarry says. Scientists can study other forms of energy, like gravity or the energy contained in food, because we can see an apple fall from a tree, and we can zoom in on the process of glucose from an apple breaking down into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for our cells. Still, scientists have tried."

Evidence:"A 2016 study published in Nutrition Journal divided 191 people with osteoarthritis into three groups: one group received placebo; one group received UC-II and the third group received chondroitin sulfate supplements. After 180 days of treatment, the UC-II group had better pain, stiffness, and function than the placebo group (and a bit better than the chondroitin group). UC-II studies done on people with rheumatoid arthritis have had mixed results. A 2009 double-blind trial that included more than 500 people with RA  found that undenatured collagen improved participants’ pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count and swollen joint count, but not as well as methotrexate. The study, published in Arthritis Research and Therapy, concluded that UC-II is safe and effective in the treatment of RA. “There’s not enough evidence to say that every patient with arthritis would benefit from any collagen supplement."

Evidence:"The possible association between mobile phone use and cancer risk, particularly among long-term heavy users of cell phones, does warrant further study – research is continuing and will be monitored. It is also important to note that there are a wide variety of everyday items which have been given the classification "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the WHO/IARC, including coffee, pickled vegetables (Asian style), engine exhaust and certain oral contraceptives. Q - Does the classification of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic mean that new information has become available? A - No. The group of studies on which this classification was based  was released about 16 months ago. They reported an increased incidence of specific brain tumours for cell phone users reporting the most use (greater than or equal to 1640 hours over life)."

Mosquitoes can also transmit serious diseases, such as:malariadengue feverencephalitis, or brain infectionyellow feverWest Nile virusZika virusmeningitis, or brain and spinal cord inflammationThese mosquito-borne diseases have potentially life-threatening complications, even though the symptoms may only last for a few days or not seem severe. Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects in the children of women who get infected with the virus while pregnant, and West Nile virus can be deadly.Seek emergency medical treatment right away if you notice any of the following symptoms after a mosquito bite:a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higherrashconjunctivitis, or eye redness pain in your muscles and jointsfeeling exhaustedpersistent headachedifficulty breathing because of anaphylaxis  Outlook for Skeeter syndromeSkeeter syndrome is rare, but the allergic reaction can be serious enough to warrant immediate medical treatment.If you have a mosquito bite allergy, you may consider ongoing treatment from an allergy specialist — especially if you live in mosquito-prone areas. An allergy specialist may be able to conduct a skin prick test to isolate what part of mosquito saliva you’re allergic to and develop an immunotherapy plan. This usually consists of getting small injections of your allergen, over the course of several months or years, until you build an immunity.Skeeter syndrome doesn’t cause any long-term illnesses or lifestyle intrusions when it’s properly managed. Just be aware of mosquitoes around you and have the right tools on hand in case you get bitten."

Am I more at risk if my relatives have cancer? Some types of cancer can run in families. For example, your risks of developing certain types of breast cancer, bowel cancer or ovarian cancer are higher if you have close relatives who developed the condition.This doesn't mean you'll definitely get cancer if some of your close family members have it, but that you may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with other people.It's estimated that between 3 and 10 in every 100 cancers are associated with an inherited faulty gene.Cancers caused by inherited faulty genes are much less common than those caused by other factors, such as ageing, smoking, being overweight and not exercising regularly, or not eating a healthy, balanced diet. Most cancers develop as a result of a combination of risk factors, which in some cases can include family history.Some types of cancer are less likely to be genetic, such as cervical cancer and lung cancer.It's only likely that a cancer gene is present in a family if:there are 2 or more close relatives on the same side of the family (your mother's or your father's side) with the same type of cancer, or with particular types of cancer that are known to be linked – for example, breast and ovarian cancer or bowel and womb cancercancers are occurring at young ages (before the age of 50)a close relative has had 2 different types of cancer (rather than 1 cancer that has spread)You should contact your GP if some close family members have developed the types of cancer mentioned above and you're worried that you might develop cancer yourself. They'll ask about your family history, and if they think there's a chance you have an increased risk of developing cancer, they'll refer you to a genetic counsellor, family cancer clinic or a cancer specialist.Cancer Research UK has more information about family history and inherited cancer genes

Evidence:"“In healthy cells, too, there is an increase in acidity when rapid energy production is required, but in cancer cells it is the dominant energy-generating pathway; acidity makes cancer cells more aggressive and more metastatic. Introducing baking soda into the method we developed will reduce the necessary drug dosage and therefore could reduce side effects.”
The study showed that the aforementioned treatment, which affects the tumor’s environment, intensifies the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy drugs. The study also shows the positive effects of a combined treatment, which attacks several components at the same time and weakens the tumor environment. “Suffocating” the tumor 
The innovation of her doctoral research is not limited to the original use of baking soda but includes a more comprehensive view of the cancerous tumor and, more importantly, its environment. “Many studies show and emphasize the importance of the tumor environment in supporting cancer cells, and in facilitating the cancer cells’ ability to penetrate nearby tissues and metastasize throughout the body,” she says. “In addition, changes in the environment of the cancerous tumor tissue may affect the tumor’s response to treatments and promote the development of resistance to the anti-cancer treatment."

Evidence:"Are Squats Bad for Your Knees? While there are some reports or rumors that state squats are bad for your knees, studies do not agree with this statement. Even with Olympic weightlifters, athletes who perform squats regularly, it has been observed that the prevalence of injury is very low. A 1999 paper published in the Journal of Athletic Training observed 27 Olympic weightlifters for a period of six years. The prevalence of injury occurring was calculated to be around 3.3 events per 1000 hours of training. Injury events observed by the researchers required a day or less of missed training for 87.3% of the cases, and less than a week for the rest."

Evidence:"However, other BP drugs, such as alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angioten-sin-receptor blockers, rarely cause ED. Some research even suggests the effect of blood pressure drugs may be more psychological than physical. When ED occurs after a man begins to take a new medication, it's possible that anxiety about his health, rather than the medication, may trigger the problem. And being aware of possible side effects may make a man more likely to recognize them as abnormal. According to Harvard Special Health Report Erectile Dysfunction, one study in the European Heart Journal looked at men newly diagnosed with heart disease, but without ED, who started treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol (Tenormin). Some of the study participants were told about the sexual side effect of the blood pressure drug, and ED was reported by almost one-third of the participants."

Evidence:"Morphine is typically only used in a healthcare setting, like hospitals. Morphine is exceedingly addictive, especially when taken in larger doses or when injected or inhaled. Many people start taking morphine in the hospital for surgery. It is also prescribed for outpatient use as MS-Contin. Even after successful detox, opiates like morphine can cause a person to experience cravings. Some clients benefit from medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which uses a partial opioid agonist like Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) to lessen cravings and eliminate withdrawal symptoms.Medication is not a stand-alone solution to opioid addiction."

Evidence:"“There is a lot of talk in the literature about whether juice is good or bad, and I think the findings from this study suggest that 100 percent juice does not have an adverse effect, or positive — it’s a neutral effect,” said Murphy.Prior research, including a Harvard study in 2013, has pointed to fruit juice as harmful rather than beneficial in terms of diabetes risk.Harvard researchers looked at the role of fruit and fruit juice in the diets of more than 180,000 British adults and concluded that whole fruit consumption led to an overall decrease in type 2 diabetes risk. Juice consumption led to an 8 percent increase.“Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids, even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits,” said Qi Sun, one of the study’s authors.Sysy Morales, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for 23 years, cautioned readers about the new study on her blog Diabetes Daily.She noted the metrics were taken on participants’ blood sugar levels after they had fasted. She said the participants were healthy and should show normal blood sugar levels after fasting.She added the study does seem legitimate, but she noted that the sugar in even “natural” fruit juice is still fructose.The American Diabetes Association agrees with Morales.“This meta-analysis examined 16 studies, none of which included people with diabetes, and none of which measured blood glucose levels soon after consuming juice — only fasting blood glucose levels,” the organization said in its statement.Defending the researchDespite the criticism, Murphy defends her team’s research. “These results are suggesting a very neutral effect in the diet, which is consistent with other research,” said Murphy.Murphy argues that there are still plenty of individuals who would benefit from 100 percent fruit juice.“We would never encourage individuals to get all of their fruit servings from juice, but certainly many people fall short of their fruit and vegetable servings, and 100 percent juices may be a way to help reach that 100 percent of that recommended intake,” she said.Research that is “industry funded” has been the target of consumer groups in recent years.A major study funded by cranberry giant Ocean Spray in 2016 about the benefits of cranberry juice consumption to treat urinary tract infections was called out by members of the media as “smoke and mirrors.”Ocean Spray continues to fund research and, in a subsequent interview with Healthline, stood by their work, as well as pledged to continue investigating the health benefits of cranberries.However, Murphy said not all industry research is the same. “Funding source isn’t synonymous with quality of a study,” she said.“Good quality studies can be funded by industry."
