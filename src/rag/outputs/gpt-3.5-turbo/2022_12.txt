Evidence:"Collagen supplementation isn't only potentially beneficial for osteoarthritis management, either. Research into oral collagen's effects on rheumatoid arthritis (a condition that happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells, causing painful swelling mainly in the hand, wrist, and knee joints) also found turned up similar findings. One of the most prominent studies is a 2009 study published in Arthritis Research & Therapy. This double-blind trial involving more than 500 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis found that oral collagen supplementation helped decrease pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count, and swollen joint count. By the way: it’s worth being mindful that while collagen supplementation could help improve joint health for those with arthritis, they're not "cures". The current literature highlights their promise, but it's always a good idea to consult a licensed medical professional if you suspect that you have (or do have) arthritis."

Evidence:"In 2011, the WHO international agency for research on cancer categorised radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone, as a Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Three large epidemiologic studies have examined the possible association between cell phone use and cancer: Interphone study; the Danish Study and the Million Women Study.”He added, “These studies have been critically evaluated reviewed and reported. These studies were not for heavy phone users. The findings of these studies are mixed, but overall, they do not show an association between cell phone use and cancer. Mobile technologies are improving all the time, so that the more recent generations emit substantially lower output power. Nevertheless, given the lack of evidence for heavy users, advising mobile phone users to reduce unnecessary exposures remains a good precautionary approach.”

Evidence:"The prevalence of autism varies considerably with case ascertainment, ranging from 0.7 – 21.1 per 10 000 children (median 5.2 per 10 000) while the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder is estimated to be 1 - 6 per 1000. Eleven epidemiological studies (representing the most recent studies, mostly in the last 4 years) were reviewed in detail, taking into consideration study design (including ecologic, case control, case-crossover and cohort studies) and limitations. The review concluded that existing studies do not show evidence of an association between the risk of autism or autistic disorders and MMR vaccine. Three laboratory studies were also reviewed. It was concluded that the alleged persistence of measles vaccine virus in the gastrointestinal tract of children with autism and inflammatory bowel disease requires further investigation through independent studies before the laboratory findings of the published studies, which have serious limitations, can be considered confirmed.Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by a better understanding of the causes of autism."

Evidence:"There is no evidence to suggest that baking soda or bicarbonate can cure Cancer.There is some evidence that bicarbonate can slow down the growth of cancer cells. A research done in 2009 showed that when bicarbonate (baking soda) is directly injected into a mice, it reduced the pH of the tumour cells and inhibited the growth of metastatic breast cancer. This is not equal to a complete cure of cancer. At the end of research, researchers concluded, “…the dramatic effect of bicarbonate therapy on the formation of breast cancer metastases in this model system warrants further investigation.” But this experiment has not yet been replicated on humans and is not an approved medical practice for cancer treatment.We asked Dr Moharir why this study was not replicated on humans.

Copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps fail to help rheumatoid arthritis, says York research
Posted on 16 September 2013
Copper bracelets and magnet wrist straps have no real effect on pain, swelling, or disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis, according to new findings from a study conducted at the University of York. In the first randomised controlled trial to study the effects of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps on rheumatoid arthritis, 70 patients with active symptoms each wore four different devices over a five-month period, reporting on their pain, disability, and medication use throughout the study. Participants also provided blood samples, after wearing each device for five weeks, in order to monitor changes in inflammation. What these findings do tell us is that people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness
Dr Stewart Richmond
The research published in PLOS ONE, show that both the standard magnetic wrist strap and the copper bracelet provided no meaningful therapeutic effects beyond those of a placebo, which was not magnetic and did not contain copper. Dr Stewart Richmond, a Research Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study, said: “It’s a shame that these devices don’t seem to have any genuine benefit. They’re so simple and generally safe to use."
Question:Do magnetic wrist straps help with arthritis?

Evidence:"The location found in our study suggests that forced preference for right-hand writing had greatest impact on the striatal territory that provides an interface between executive and cognitive control of skilled movements. We argue that a forced switch of handedness represents an early and persistent environmental modulator of maturation of the basal ganglia, which itself is genetically determined and only complete in the third decade of life (Steen et al., 1997; Sowell et al., 1999; Snook et al., 2005). Morphometric studies in children aged 7–16 have described a substantial loss of striatal and pallidal volume during normal development (Sowell et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2000), likely because of pruning processes. Studies in genetically caused disorders found a relative size increase of these structures compared with controls (Binkofski et al., 2007; Gothelf et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning in the territory of the putamen that integrates executive and cognitive aspects of motor control. In converted left-handers, individual variations in the volume of the left midputamen correlate with the acquired dexterity of handwriting."

Evidence:"But the special seasoning isn't necessarily better for you than other types of salt.Here's everything you need to know about pink Himalayan salt, and whether or not it's worth your money. Pink Himalayan salt has a slightly higher amount of trace minerals. Pink Himalayan salt is slightly different from regular salt because it comes from the Khewra Salt Mine located near the Himalayas in Pakistan, Healthline reports. The natural harvesting process that allows the salt to "possess many other minerals and trace elements that are not found in regular table salt," as Healthline further reports. Although there are reportedly an estimated 84 different minerals and trace elements found in pink salt — thus giving it it's unique color, and slightly different taste — only 2% of the salt is made up of these minerals, Medical News Today reports. This means pink Himalayan salt is nutritionally similar to regular salt."

Evidence:"Fish-oil supplements aren't going to lower cholesterol better than prescription drugs, a new study from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found.Cleveland Clinic researchers tested supplements like fish oil and turmeric against statins, a class of prescription drugs that lowers cholesterol, and a placebo to compare how much each substance lowered "bad" cholesterol. "Bad" cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein, is associated with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Excess LDL builds up in the blood-vessel walls and inhibits blood flow, which reduces or blocks the blood from giving the heart oxygen.The study gave 190 adults with no history of cholesterol buildup in the artery walls — otherwise known as atherosclerosis — either statins, a placebo, or one of the following supplements: fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. After 28 days, researchers found people who took the prescription drug had a greater reduction in LDL compared with supplement and placebo users.None of the dietary supplements decreased LDL significantly more than the placebo, researchers said. More people are buying dietary supplements, but do they work?The JACC study builds on a growing body of evidence indicating supplements don't do much to help your health. An independent team of preventive-care experts said there wasn't enough evidence to show vitamin A, vitamin E, or multivitamin supplements prevented heart disease or cancer.Dr."

Evidence:"(http://news.gallup.com/poll/194195/adults-say-smoke-marijuana.aspx) The NIH reports that anywhere between 9 to 30 percent of people who use marijuana may be either physically dependent on it (they get withdrawal symptoms when they stop using it) or have what is called a marijuana use disorder (an addiction).So yes, you can smoke pot without being addicted. A lot of people experiment with marijuana—especially in their teens or young adult years—and then stop as they grow up. Some people will recreationally use marijuana their whole lives without being addicted. There are regular pot users over the age of 65.But for others, marijuana use can become problematic. Some research shows that using marijuana can set off psychosis early in people who are already at risk. People who develop an addiction may see problems in school, work, or relationships."

Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesThe quest to reduce cardiovascular diseaseAt Sheffield Hallam University, David Rogerson has spent the past decade studying the effects of dietary interventions on physical health. He says that one reason veganism could be good for you is because it can protect against cardiosvascular diseases, by reducing obesity and lowering cholesterol. These chronic illnesses cost the UK around £9bn a year; veganism may be the solution.“There’s growing evidence that reduced consumption of animal products, coupled with an increase in plant-based foods, seems to be good for our health,” says Rogerson. “This is perhaps due to these foods containing lot of antioxidant phytonutrients and nitrates, while some animal products contain lots of pro-inflammatory fats and lead to the production of a metabolite called TMAO, which has been linked to cardiovascular problems.”The anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based foods is thought to be the reason why vegan diets appear to relieve symptoms of some auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The tennis player Venus Williams, who suffers from Sjögren’s syndrome, credits turning vegan with mitigating the extreme fatigue associated with the condition, and with enabling her to continue competing at the highest level.The full picture is rather more complex than it first seems."

In light of these concerns, the agency proposed taking it off the GRASE list in 2006, but little has happened since then. “In the interim,” says the FDA on its hydroquinone website, “we believe that hydroquinone should remain available as an OTC drug product.” Naturally, industry groups are downplaying the ingredient’s health threat with their usual zeal."

AbstractMethanol ingestion is an uncommon form of poisoning that can cause severe metabolic disturbances, blindness, permanent neurologic dysfunction and death. While methanol itself may be harmless, it is converted in vivo to the highly toxic formic acid. The diagnosis is sometimes elusive and requires a high index of suspicion. Because antidotal treatment is available it is important to recognize methanol poisoning promptly. The presence of metabolic acidosis associated with an increased anion gap and increased osmol gap are important laboratory findings."

Exercise is one of the best ways to lower your cholesterol. It can have a direct impact on your cholesterol levels, but it can also help to improve your heart health by helping you to reach or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers have found that exercise alone can help to reduce your cholesterol levels. Exercise can stimulate enzymes that remove bad cholesterol out of your blood and into the liver, where it can be broken down and removed from your body. It also affects the proteins that carry cholesterol in your blood."

Evidence:"Protection around the eyesAnother factor to consider is that sunglasses help protect the skin around the eyes — areas where it can be hard to apply sunscreen.The AAO advisory recommends buying oversized shades to help protect these areas as well as to cut down on UV rays entering from the sides.For those who want to make sure their shades offer adequate UV protection, the best option is to seek out a UV light meter to test how well the lenses block out UV rays. These meters are commonly found at optical shops.Wearers of contact lenses can easily wear a pair of nonprescription sunglasses to help protect their eyes. But it’s also worth noting that many brands of contact lenses also offer UV protection.“Most rigid gas permeable hard lenses have an ultraviolet filter, which is helpful in protecting from UV rays,” says McLaughlin.“Good sunglasses will certainly help protect the eyes in terms of reducing UV exposure,” concludes McLaughlin. “This will help protect the eyes in terms of lowering the progression of cataracts. I think if we all live long enough, we’re all going to develop cataracts — but this can slow the progression. Wearing sunglasses can be beneficial in delaying the risk of macular degeneration."

HIV is very similar to a virus called SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), which is found in monkeys. There’s now good evidence that it jumped species to humans, probably in the late 19th or early 20th century. The most common theory suggests that this happened during hunting and butchering of primates such as chimpanzees."

Evidence:"There's no specific amount of water that is too much, it depends on factors like age and overall health. Drinking water is essential to keeping the body healthy and functioning properly. However, there's such a thing as drinking too much water too fast, aka water intoxication.Water intoxication occurs when you drink so much water that the kidneys can't eliminate it fast enough, so it begins to dilute electrolytes — primarily sodium — in the blood. Although it's rare, water intoxication can lead to death if not treated immediately.Here are the symptoms of water intoxication and how it is generally treated. How much is too much water?Water intoxication is a dangerous and severe condition because blood sodium levels drop rapidly, causing neurologic changes like hallucinations and confusion.Important: Drinking too much water can lead to hyponatremia, which occurs when blood sodium levels drop below 134 mEq/L. There are some instances where hyponatremia poses no immediate threat to a person's health."

Evidence:"HIV is most commonly transmitted through vaginal or anal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include:
using a contaminated needle, syringe or other equipment to inject drugs
transmission from a mother to her child before, during or shortly after birth however, with medical treatment it is possible to prevent the virus from being passed on by a mother to her child
through blood transfusions however, since 1985 all blood donated in the UK must be screened for HIV - screening policies in the developing world may not be as rigorous, so there is a possible risk of developing HIV if you receive a blood transfusion in certain parts of the world
through oral sex or sharing sex toys
HIV cannot be transmitted from:
kissing
being sneezed on by someone with HIV
sharing baths, towels or cutlery with an HIV-infected person
swimming in a pool or sitting on a toilet seat that someone with HIV has used
animals or insects such as mosquitoes

Protecting yourself from HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles, syringes or other injecting equipment. Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. You should use condoms for oral, vaginal and anal sex and pieces of latex (dental dams or plastic wrap) which act as a barrier, for oral sex on the vagina or anus."
Question:Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?

Evidence:"It is possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding and not having a period, though the chances of conception are reduced. Pregnancy can occur any time starting about 3 weeks after giving birth, even if you are breastfeeding and have not yet had a period. It’s a misconception that a woman cannot get pregnant following delivery until at least one period has occurred. But the ovaries release an egg before a period starts so a person may be fertile for at least a few weeks before there are any obvious signs. Fertility does tend to be reduced while breastfeeding, because breastfeeding lowers the levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone which are necessary for ovulation and pregnancy to occur."
Question:Can a woman get pregnant while breastfeeding?

Evidence:"It became particularly popular in the 1970s when Nobel laureate Linus Pauling concluded from earlier placebo-controlled trials that vitamin C would prevent and alleviate the common cold. Over two dozen new trials were undertaken thereafter. Vitamin C has been widely sold and used as a preventive and therapeutic agent. This review is restricted to placebo-controlled trials testing 0.2 g/day or more of vitamin C. Regular ingestion of vitamin C had no effect on common cold incidence in the ordinary population, based on 29 trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants. However, regular supplementation had a modest but consistent effect in reducing the duration of common cold symptoms, which is based on 31 study comparisons with 9745 common cold episodes. In five trials with 598 participants exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress (including marathon runners and skiers) vitamin C halved the common cold risk."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Lemon water may boost your metabolismBoth the lemon and water components of lemon water can boost your metabolism.One small study on the impact of drinking room temperature water on metabolism found that drinking 500ml of water increased participants’ metabolic rate by 30% for up to 40 minutes after ingestion. Some of the energy expenditure was from heating the water to body temperature.¹¹When you drink cooler water, your body expends even more energy to heat it, so drinking a cool glass of lemon water regularly throughout the day could increase your metabolism, leading to weight loss.Lemon water helps you stay hydrated throughout the day, promoting weight loss by inducing increased lipolysis (fat breakdown). Animal studies have consistently shown that increasing hydration results in enhanced mitochondrial activity in fat cells, which causes lipolysis.¹²The lemon extract itself may also aid weight loss by suppressing weight gain and fat accumulation. Studies in mice on a high-fat diet showed that weight gain, fat accumulation, high cholesterol, high sugar levels, and insulin resistance were all significantly suppressed by lemon polyphenols.¹³Hesperidin, a flavonoid found in lemons, has been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism by lowering the production of VLDL, a bad type of cholesterol, and serum triglycerides.¹⁴ Triglycerides are essentially the extra calories you consume that you don’t burn, which are then stored in your fat cells. Reducing triglycerides assists with both weight loss and overall health. How to make lemon waterLemon water is typically made by adding the juice of half a lemon to an eight-ounce cup or glass of water."

Evidence:"Those in the highest quintile were identified as being the most at risk for developing colorectal cancer. Although there was a clear link identified for men, particularly in cases of colorectal cancer in the distal colon, the study did not find an overall increased risk for women who consumed higher amounts of ultra-processed foods. Health impacts of processed meat
The analyses revealed differences in the ways that men and women consume ultra-processed foods and the prospective associated cancer risk. Out of the study participants, the research team documented 1,294 cases of colorectal cancer among men and 1,922 cases among women. The team found the strongest association between colorectal cancer and ultra-processed foods among men came from the meat, poultry, or fish-based, ready-to-eat products. “These products include some processed meats like sausages, bacon, ham, and fish cakes,” Wang said."
Question:Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"Although skin tags are technically considered to be a type of tumor, they are not cancerous. And unlike many other skin conditions, skin tags aren’t contagious. You can’t “catch” a skin tag from someone else or spread it from one part of your body to another. Skin tags can develop in people at any age. While skin tags can appear just about anywhere, they’re especially common in parts of the body that rub against clothing or skin. Skin tags may arise on the neck, chest, back, armpits, groin, and eyelids."
Question:Are skin tags contagious?
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"Adolescents who practiced oil pulling for 30 days exhibited a statistically significant decrease in gingival indices.However, researchers have not proven whether oil pulling removes enough bacteria to decrease the risk of cavities, nor have they compared the effectiveness to the brushing and flossing. While oil pulling could work well for those with relatively healthy teeth and gums, the technique doesn’t present a reliable cure for gingivitis and gum disease.In severe infections, the gums inflame, swell, and pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that even more bacteria can hide. As gingivitis progresses, these pockets increase from a healthy two or three millimeter depth to a four or five millimeter depth (or more).As the oils slide along the gum’s surface, they likely won’t fight or remove plaque lodged deep within the gums. Only a professional scaling (scraping) and root planning can clean tartar from below the gum line, so don’t skip out on your dentist appointment just yet. 3. It May Lead to Side Effects
Many people assert that oil pulling causes no side effects and that the technique is completely safe for anyone to try."
Question:Can oil pulling heal cavities?
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Yes, it seems that people who consume a lot of fiber in their diet seem to have fewer chances of having this disease. In fact, there are many doctors who initially prescribe patients to consume more fibrous foods rather than giving them medicines for relief. Eating low-fat, high in fiber whole foods as recommended by your doctor could make stools softer and easier to pass and can prevent the symptoms of hemorrhoids. That is because fiber helps a person to: – 
Enhance stools weight and softer, reduce the time feces spends in the colonIncrease water retention in the colon, resulting in softer stools that pass more easilyIt helps reduce the pH levels in the colon, and also reduces colon transit time. According to doctors, most people should aim to get 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they consume. There are plenty of foods that contain fiber, yet few of them are the best foods to eat to help with hemorrhoids or piles:

Evidence:"Do not stop taking the medication without medical advice. Please continue reading to learn more about some common medications with which grapefruit juice and grapefruit interact.Does eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice affect medications?Yes, there can be some food-drug interactions between grapefruit products and certain medications. In most cases, the drug interaction leads to increased blood levels of the medicine, causing an increased risk of side effects.Now you may be wondering why only certain drugs interact with grapefruit. Here’s how the potential drug interactions happen. When you take the drugs by mouth, they are absorbed through the transporter cells in the gut. From there, they enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver where they are metabolized (broken down) or activated by the enzymes in the liver."
Question:Can grapefruit interfere with medication?
Your answer:
yes

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The vagus is a long nerve extending from the brain that connects the airway to the rest of the nervous system and plays a key role in heart rate, breathing, and other functions. The researchers showed that detaching the nerve in rats prevented blood vessel damage caused by tobacco smoke, demonstrating its key role in this process. “We were surprised to find that there was not a single component that you could remove to stop the damaging effect of smoke or vapors on the blood vessels,” Springer said. “As long as there’s an irritant in the airway, blood vessel function may be impaired.”   
The finding has implications for efforts to regulate tobacco products and e-cigarettes, as it underscores how difficult it is to pinpoint any one ingredient in them that is responsible for blood vessel damage. “What I like to tell people is this: Just breathe clean air and avoid using these products,” Springer said. Lisa Postow, Ph.D., an NHLBI program officer in NHLBI’s Division of Lung Diseases, agreed that the study results “provide further evidence that exposure to e-cigarettes could lead to harmful cardiovascular health effects.” She added that more data is needed to fully understand the health effects of e-cigarettes."

All fruits are excellent sources of blood sugar-balancing fiber and disease-fighting minerals and vitamins—and bananas are no exception. Bananas, in particular, are high in potassium, a mineral that is known to help lower blood pressure."
Question:Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"It is thus likely that complaints to have experienced detrimental effects when being exposed to WiFi are owing to a nocebo response. A recent experimental double-blind study using sham and real WiFi exposure demonstrated that negative expectations about the harmfulness of EMF may foster the occurrence of illusory symptom perceptions via alterations in the somatosensory decision criterion (Wolters et al., 2021).In conclusion, we found little evidence that WiFi exposure is a health risk in the everyday environment, where exposure levels are typically considerably lower than ICNIRP guideline values. Observational studies on long-term effects specifically focusing on WiFi are scarce and challenging to conduct given the little exposure contribution from WiFi to overall RF-EMF exposure. Experimental studies, although limited in numbers, did not provide evidence that WiFi exposure may be more problematic than other types of RF-EMF exposure in a similar frequency and intensity range, and it is justified to conduct health risk evaluation for WiFi based on the total RF-EMF literature. Given the fact that some people state to react to specific RF-EMF sources, we recommend further experimental studies aiming to clarify the exact role of the signal characteristics by systematically exploring different aspects of RF-EMF exposure such as frequency, signal characteristics and crest factors in addition to intensity and duration of exposure. A more systematic and concerted approach would provide more reliable information for risk assessment for specific RF-EMF sources or for new exposure situations like the ongoing introduction of the fifth generation mobile radio technology (5 G)."

Evidence:"We need more and bigger investigations into its benefits. But so far, here's what research has found:It may help with weight loss. One study showed that taking apple cider vinegar twice a day helped people following a reduced-calorie diet lose a few extra pounds. But the study was small and short-term, following 39 people for 12 weeks.Some researchers thought the vinegar's acetic acid might speed up metabolism. But the data didn't bear this out. It may be that people lost more weight because of the placebo effect."
