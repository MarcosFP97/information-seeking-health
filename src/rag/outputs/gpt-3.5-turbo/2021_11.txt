Evidence:"To assess brain function, researchers gave volunteers a variety of memory and thinking tests at the start and end of the study.“While the homocysteine levels decreased by more in the group taking the B vitamins than in the group taking the placebo, unfortunately there was no difference between the two groups in the scores on the thinking and memory tests,” said Dhonukshe-Rutten.Read More About Vitamins: Can They Boost Memory? »Vitamin B12 May Have Subtle BenefitsPrevious research included another two-year study, published in 2010 in Neurology, that found that vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid supplements did not improve the mental abilities of men 75 and older. Eight years after the study ended, though, the men had a small decrease in their risk of cognitive impairment, though it was not a significant change.Certain people taking the supplements in the new long-term study did experience some small positive effects. One analysis of the data found that people with low blood levels of holotranscobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, improved their thinking speed with the vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements.“This agrees with the entire clinical picture of B12-related to memory trouble,” said Zwerling.The supplements given to both groups in the new study also included 15 micrograms of vitamin D3, which may improve brain function at high levels. It is possible that vitamin D3 diluted the effects of the other supplements on mental performance, although it could have simply eliminated any vitamin D3 deficiency among the participants.“Individuals, especially the elderly, differ in their metabolism of vitamin D and susceptibility to vitamin D deficiency,” said Zwerling. “Overall, the use of D3 just ‘evened the playing ground’ in a population known to have high rates of deficiency.”Although this new study failed to demonstrate the mental benefits of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements, vitamin B12 remains essential for overall health.Find Out: What Causes Dementia?"

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"In fact, back in 2002, research published in JAMA Pediatrics found that duct tape was significantly more effective at treating the of verruca vulgaris, or common warts, than cyrotherapy was.In that study, 51 young subjects were given either cryotherapy—in which liquid nitrogen is applied directly to the wart to freeze it off—or duct tape application for two months. When the warts were measured after that time, 85 percent of the duct-tape group had complete resolution of their warts, versus 60 percent of the cryotherapy patients.So, low-cost wart cure for the win? It’s a little early in the game to declare duct tape the clearcut winner, says Adam Friedman, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. There’s still not a whole lot of conclusive research out there on the topic.“The jury is still out as to whether or not this works,” he notes, pointing to a well-controlled 2007 study that found no difference in treatment with duct tape and with moleskin, which was used as a control. Other studies have shown some improvement, but not in a statistically significant way, he adds.But, that said, don’t put away your roll quite yet, MacGyver.All of these studies are looking at duct tape as the lone wart therapy, Dr. Friedman says. That might be the issue, since there could be a role for the fix-it staple in combination with in-office procedures or other at-home treatment, he says.That’s because duct tape does have a helpful mechanism for wart relief.Think of how you’re using it."

Evidence:"Yoon S et al in a study titled ‘The therapeutic effect of evening primrose oil in atopic dermatitis patients with dry scaly skin lesions is associated with the normalization of serum gamma-interferon levels’ published in the Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, 2002;15(1):20-5, researchers gave EPO to 14 patients with atopic dermatitis. Skin lesions were analysed before and after treatment which led researchers to conclude EPO may be effective in helping treat non-inflammatory atopic dermatitis. In agreement with Yoon, Senapati S et al in a study titled ‘Evening primrose oil is effective in atopic dermatitis: a randomized placebo-controlled trial’ published in the Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, 2008 Sep-Oct;74(5):447-52, Senapati et al carried out this study for 5 months whereby they gave one group of participants a placebo every day and one group an EPO capsule. Clinical evaluations were before the study and every month thereafter for 5 months. Results showed that by the end of the study 96% of the participants that were given EPO showed significant skin improvement. On the other hand, other studies seem unconvinced, but the general consensus is that EPO has a positive impact upon the symptoms of eczema thereby helping to lessen symptoms such as dry, itchy, flaky or inflamed skin."

Evidence:"The ankle brace may impair your mobility and some of your neuromuscular control in such a way that it puts you at risk for injury elsewhere.”
Most people won’t wear an ankle brace pre-injury: The primary role of the ankle brace is after one injury in order to prevent a second injury. “The risks for recurrent ankle sprains during that recovery phase is fairly high,” LaBotz said. “While you're healing, your job is not to injure the ankle again, and until your strength and balance are fully recovered, this brace is going to help you stay stable.” 
During this time, she recommends wearing the brace anytime you’re on uneven terrain (like a hike or playing your sport) but you don’t need to wear it all day. If all you do is wear a brace to recover from a sprain, you may notice that your balance and strength decreases in that foot and ankle. But if you use the ankle brace in conjunction with physical therapy or rehabilitation exercises designed to rebuild strength, balance, and healthy movement patterns, you’re fine."

Evidence:"Of these six included studies, three reported a significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance of scars when using vitamin E: one study used topical vitamin E in white children as monotherapy, and two studies used vitamin E in an adult population as combination therapy. The other three selected studies showed no significant improvement in scar appearance when using topical vitamin E as monotherapy. Two of the six included studies reported adverse events of vitamin E application: contact dermatitis and increased incidence of itching and rash.ConclusionsWe conclude that there is not yet sufficient evidence that monotherapy with topical vitamin E has a significant beneficial effect on scar appearance to justify its widespread use. Further prospective studies with vitamin E monotherapy and/or combination therapy are warranted to draw better conclusions regarding the value of vitamin E in the management of scar healing.Level of Evidence2 Therapeutic 
Scar treatment has always been and still is an important topic for plastic surgeons, because poorly healed, clearly visible scars can have significant negative effects on cosmesis and patient self-esteem. In recent years, several scar treatment strategies have been developed and recommended. Some of these treatment options include only one modality,1 whereas others combine several modalities such as surgery,2 laser treatment,3 radiation therapy,4,5 pressure therapy,6 and cryotherapy.7 In addition, several pharmaceutical agents are recommended to treat scars, such as topical vitamin E, steroids, antioxidants, moisturizers, and so on."

People who suffer from diabetes are commonly told that the key to improved diabetes control involves lifestyle changes, including a regular exercise routine. However, it’s not always clear how and why exercise plays such a crucial role. The word “exercise” can be intimidating, but it does not have to mean running a marathon or bench pressing your body weight. Exercise is simply getting physically active and increasing your heart rate. This can include marathon running, but it also includes walking, biking, gardening, climbing stairs, chair exercises, stretch-band exercises, Zumba, yoga, etc. If you are not ready to run that marathon, the term “physical activity” might be more comfortable."

New study reports that fermented milk may have antihypertensive properties that can help reduce hypertension (high blood pressure). The study also examined potential mechanistic pathways of gut modulation via antihypertensive fermented milks. Hypertension is a metabolic disease and risk factor for cardiovascular disease, making it one of the leading causes of death across the world. Gut microbiota impact intestinal development, body metabolism, barrier integrity and function, the immune system and the central nervous system. Diabetes and Hypertension Diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) are significant health problems worldwide, but like cardiac disease and fatty liver disease, people of Indian origin are disproportionately affected.

Evidence:"“A therapy lamp may be less optimal for treating bipolar disorder, especially for someone prone to manic episodes.”Not only does this type of therapy help stabilize mood, but it can also increase energy. Fatigue and a lack of motivation are common symptoms of depression, and light therapy may help with these symptoms in some people.Are there any side effects?Some people may have side effects from sun lamps, such as eyestrain, headaches, or nausea.Extreme light exposure can trigger migraine or other neurologic and psychiatric conditions, Zager says.Light therapy may not be appropriate for some people with light-sensitive skin or eyes, or health conditions that make them sensitive to light, like lupus. Certain medications, like antibiotics, some anti-inflammatories, and some skin medications, can make you sensitive to light, too.If you have glaucoma, retinopathy, or cataracts, experts recommend using sun lamps under the supervision of an eye doctor.It’s important to check with your doctor before beginning light therapy.Next stepsAs an accessible and noninvasive form of treatment, there are many possible advantages to trying light therapy for depression.

Evidence:"I Asked a DermRead this before slathering that sh*t on.By Chloe MetzgerPublished: Nov 29, 2019Khadija HortonThere are a few things that make me, the resident skin-obsessed beauty editor, gasp a horrible gasp in my cold, dead heart: when someone admits to sleeping in their makeup (stop), when someone tells me they only use makeup wipes to “wash” their face (seriously, stop), and when someone talks about putting toothpaste on their pimples (I actually can’t). Unfortunately for me, I hear these confessions weekly from coworkers and friends (see: my recent text exchange), and thus I am always in a state of death…and explanations.Chloe MetzgerSo I’m here today with the help of a dermatologist to tackle one of these terrible, horrible, no good, very bad beauty beliefs once and for all, so we can all move on to a better state of skin enlightenment. Ahead, everything you’ve ever wanted to know/have personally asked me about putting toothpaste on pimples and breakouts.Can toothpaste get rid of a pimple?Here’s the gist: You get a zit, you slather it with toothpaste before bed, and then you wake up with clear skin. Wow, magical! But not real."

Evidence:"Several studies were funded by makers of chondroitin. This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis:
- Chondroitin may improve pain slightly in the short-term (less than 6 months);
- Chondroitin improves knee pain by 20% in slightly more people;
- Chondroitin probably improves quality of life slightly as measured by Lequesne's index (combined measure of pain, function, and disability);
- Chondroitin has little or no difference in adverse and serious adverse events versus other agents; and
- Chondroitin slightly slows down the narrowing of joint space on X-rays of the affected joint. We identified a lot of studies in which unsound methods were used to assess the effects of chondroitin. For some outcomes, there was not enough data. In some studies, whose methodological quality was better, chondroitin showed no improvement in pain and in physical function. Other analyses based on different methodological quality criteria reported improvement in pain and physical functionality when chondroitin was given."

Evidence:"HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Omega-3 fatty acids lower plasma triglyceride levels, particularly in persons with hyper-triglyceridemia,14 by inhibiting the synthesis of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver. A review15 of human studies concluded that approximately 4 g per day of omega-3 fatty acids reduced serum triglyceride concentrations by 25 to 30 percent, increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 5 to 10 percent, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 1 to 3 percent. Total cholesterol was not significantly affected.15 
A randomized controlled trial16 compared two groups of patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. One group received simvastatin in a dosage of 10 to 40 mg per day plus 4 g per day of Omacor (which contains 90 percent omega-3 fatty acid; 840 mg EPA plus DHA per capsule), while those in the second group received the same dosage of simvastatin and a placebo. Patients who received simvastatin plus Omacor had 20 to 30 percent decreases in serum triglyceride concentrations and 30 to 40 percent decreases in VLDL cholesterol levels compared with those receiving simvastatin and placebo.16 No increases in LDL cholesterol levels were observed. Overall, results have shown variable effects of omega-3 fatty acids on total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels.14–17 
HYPERTENSION
Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have a dose-response hypotensive effect in patients with hypertension and have little to no effect in normotensive patients.18 A meta-analysis19 of 31 trials and a total of 1,356 patients found that 5.6 g per day of fish oil reduced blood pressure by 3.4/2.0 mm Hg."

Croup, which affects about one in 20 children under the age of six, has conventionally been treated by: Turning on a hot shower. Putting boiling water in a bowl. Or delivering humidity with machines and a face mask in hospital emergency rooms. But there was little scientific evidence to bolster claims that steam eased two of croup's main symptoms, a seal-like barking cough and difficulty breathing. Researchers at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children conducted a randomized trial to verify whether humidity improved symptoms in children with moderate to severe croup."

Evidence:"L-Theanine Alleviates Stress and AnxietyL-theanine can make you more mentally resilient by reducing both psychological and physiological stress responses. It reduces the anxiety felt in social situations.   " L-theanine causes an increase in alpha activity, the brainwave state associated with relaxation and attention. This is the same brainwave state achieved during meditation. It can lower your heart rate and help you maintain a healthy blood pressure when you’re under stress. L-theanine diminishes the symptoms of anxiety by increasing the level of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in relaxation.When your GABA level is low, it becomes much harder to quiet your mind and you may often feel overwhelmed and overstimulated."

Evidence:"As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.Exercise and anxietyExercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment."

Evidence:"Read more to learn about how you can use zinc for colds. What Is Zinc? Zinc is an important nutrient that can be found throughout your body.2 It is good for helping your immune system and metabolic function, and it can help promote wound healing.2 Consuming zinc on a daily basis can help support growth and development during pregnancy and childhood.3 Zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, impaired immune function and delayed growth, so it’s important to include plenty of zinc in your diet.3 The recommended daily zinc intake is around 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women.2
Zinc can be taken as an oral supplement.2 However, your body will usually get enough zinc through a balanced diet.2 Oysters contain the most zinc out of any other food, but red meats and poultry also have significant amounts of zinc.3 Other good sources of zinc include beans, nuts, breakfast cereals and yogurt.3
Does Zinc Help with Colds
Unfortunately, there is no cure for the common cold, which means the virus has to run its course.1 Despite there being no cure, zinc can be useful in managing a cold to help you while you recover. Research shows that taking zinc at the first sign of cold symptoms can significantly reduce both the severity and duration of symptoms.4 Taking zinc may help prevent the rhinovirus (or cold virus) from multiplying and may stop the virus from lodging in the mucous membranes of the nose and throat.5 Symptoms you may experience with the common cold include sneezing, runny nose, cough and sore throat, so remember to increase your zinc intake at the first sign of these conditions.1 Taking zinc in the form of a lozenge or syrup may be the most effective methods for helping colds because they allow the substance to stay in the throat and come in contact with the virus.5
What Are Some Risks with Taking Zinc Supplements for Colds? Like many other supplements and medicines, side effects can occur after taking zinc supplements for colds. Zinc lozenges can cause side effects like nausea or a bad taste in your mouth.5 Taking large amounts of zinc can lead to zinc toxicity and cause vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps and headaches.3 Permanent loss of smell is a possible side effect from using zinc nasal sprays, so make sure to avoid using them to help your cold.5 Zinc is also known to cause interactions with some types of medications."

Evidence:"Other symptoms include itching, burning, stinging, small blisters, fissures (splitting) and bleeding. The good news is that athletes foot is easily treated by using creams and powders. Antifungal creams work by preventing fungi from multiplying (fungi-static), or by killing fungi directly (fungi-cidal). Fungi-static antifungal creams need to be applied for approximately two weeks after the infection has cleared, while fungi-cidal antifungal creams can be stopped once the infection has cleared. Antifungal powders are good for dusting in shoes or socks to kill residual fungal spores and prevent reoccurrence, while corticosteroid creams help reduce itch and inflammation. Corticosteroid creams must be applied sparingly and used strictly according to product recommendations and the advice from your community pharmacist."

Evidence:"The studies compared people who took 4000 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) a day to people who took a placebo (fake pill) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it? Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling. It is not clear which type is best to use or which causes more side effects: high doses of acetaminophen may cause stomach problems, such as ulcers, and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems."

randomised trial of music therapy specifically for depression and the results
suggest that it can improve the mood and global functioning of people with this
disorder. Among the challenges involved in evaluating complex interventions such as music
therapy are those associated with treatment fidelity. Erkkilä et
al have addressed this issue by ensuring that the music therapists who
delivered treatment all completed an extensive induction focused on ensuring
fidelity, and videotaped their sessions with participants to monitor adherence. The attention to fidelity is borne out in results that do not vary between
therapists. This suggests that the agent of change is not likely to be the
personality of the therapist or the nature of the particular therapist-patient
alliance (as highlighted by the common factors approach, for example Messer & Wampold

Evidence:"A systematic review and metaanalysis that included 11 placebo-controlled studies involving 5,660 patients concluded that overall, vitamin D showed a protective effect against respiratory tract illnesses (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.84), but that significant heterogeneity and possible publication bias meant that the result should be interpreted with caution (14). Bolus supplementation with vitamin D in adults did not reduce asthma exacerbations in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (10). So our golden bullet is not looking so great.A further loss of luster comes from the study in this issue of the Journal by Denlinger and colleagues (pp. 634–641), in which they report on the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on URIs in individuals with asthma (15). Their article outlines a prearranged secondary analysis of the recent VIDA (Vitamin D Add-on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Asthma) trial (16), in which adults with mild to moderate symptomatic asthma and baseline vitamin D insufficiency were randomly assigned to daily vitamin D3 or placebo for 28 weeks in conjunction with tapering of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses. In the earlier report, vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce rates of first asthma treatment failures (16).In the current report (15), vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce the severity of URI symptoms, nor did it alter the overall rate of symptomatic URIs."

Evidence:"Since we know that antioxidants are good at reducing oxidative stress, which antioxidants are best for promoting male fertility?Best antioxidants for male fertilityAccording to Dr. Ghayda, several antioxidants are beneficial for male fertility, including coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, and selenium. "However, the most important one is coenzyme Q10, which has the highest level of evidence and highest research studies behind it," he advises. So, let's begin with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).CoQ10A study published in the International Journal of Reproductive Biomedicine showed the seminal concentration of CoQ10 is linked to key semen parameters such as sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. This is because the total antioxidant capacity, or the ability of your body to neutralize free radicals, improves when supplementing with CoQ10. Several studies concur that supplementing with CoQ10 may improve sperm quality and concentration. A 2020 review concluded that CoQ10 has a profound effect on sperm motility."
