Evidence:"You might wonder: what do tea bags have to do with pulled teeth?Why the tea bag? Tea bags are a natural way to stop bleeding after dental surgery. This is why they work:Black tea is full of tannins, which are hemostatic (i.e. they cause blood to coagulate, which in turn makes the bleeding stop).Tannins are also astringent. An astringent is something that causes body tissues, including blood vessels, to shrink or constrict."
Question:Do tea bags help to clot blood in pulled teeth?

Evidence:"Collagen hydrolysate supplements are rich in a number of amino acids (a group of chemical compounds) that play an important role in the creation of collagen. Type II collagen is one of the main proteins in cartilage. It’s been suggested that taking collagen hydrolysate can improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis by stimulating your body’s production of joint collagen. Some studies have suggested that autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by taking a foreign antigen (a substance that causes your immune system to react to it) by mouth, which could dampen down your immune system’s reaction. Taking collagen by mouth may introduce some chemicals that cause joint inflammation into your body and create oral tolerance to these antigens, reducing the effects of inflammatory arthritis."

Evidence:"Scientific Consensus on Cell Phone Safety
Scientific studies: The FDA’s physicians, scientists, and engineers regularly analyze scientific studies and publications for evidence of health effects of exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phones. The weight of nearly 30 years of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from use of cell phones to health problems, such as cancer. Public health data: The FDA also monitors and analyzes public health data on cancer rates in the U.S. population. The data clearly demonstrate no widespread rise in brain and other nervous system cancers in the last 30 years despite the enormous increase in cell phone use during this period. In fact, the rate of brain and other nervous system cancers diagnosed in United States has decreased for the last 15 years or so. See Scientific Evidence for Cell Phone Safety for details on the scientific studies and public health data."

WD-40 acts as a joint lubricant and pain reliever in arthritis. January 1
  Patients who suffer from arthritis are trying anything to relieve those stiff and aching joints. Some have even tried spraying sore joints with WD-40 as they would to fix a squeaky, door hinge. But this folk remedy is not proven to work and may even be harmful. WD-40 contains petroleum distillates than can cause drying and irritation of the skin. Plus there are reports of people who developed lipoid pneumonia after inhaling the mist from WD-40."

Evidence:"The findings are complicated.There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer. It’s important to remember that cancer grows quite well in healthy tissue with normal pH levels. Additionally, naturally acidic environments, like the stomach, don’t encourage cancer growth.Once cancer cells begin to grow, they produce an acidic environment that encourages malignant growth. The goal of many researchers is to decrease the acidity of that environment so that the cancer cells aren’t able to thrive.A 2009 study published in Cancer Research found that injecting bicarbonate into mice reduced tumor pH levels and slowed the progression of metastatic breast cancer.The acidic microenvironment of tumors may be related to chemotherapeutic failure in cancer treatment. Cancer cells are difficult to target because the area around them is acidic, though they’re alkaline. Many cancer drugs have trouble passing through these layers.Several studies have evaluated the use of antacid drugs in combination with chemotherapy.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed for the treatment of acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)."

Evidence:"You might be better off on a medication less likely to cause a problem.High Blood Pressure Drugs Not Likely to Cause EDSome families of high blood pressure drugs rarely cause ED as a side effect. They include:ACE inhibitorsAlpha-blockersCalcium channel blockersARBsACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors -- such as Capoten, Lotensin, Prinivil, and Zestril for example -- widen blood vessels and increase blood flow. Erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect, occurring in less than 1% of patients. There are several different drugs in this category. This seems to be true of all of them. There are also drugs known as calcium channel blockers, such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, or Verapamil."

Evidence:"All rights reserved.100 Percent Fruit Juice Does Not Affect Blood Sugar LevelsFebruary 6, 2018Mark L. FuerstJuice is good food and does not contribute to disruption of glucose-insulin homeostasis, as long as its 100% real fruit juice, according to a new study.A comprehensive data analysis suggests that 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, or insulin resistance, according to a new study.The findings are consistent with previous research indicating that 100% fruit juice is not associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and support a growing body of evidence that 100% fruit juice has no significant effect on glycemic control.Juice is good foodPure, 100% fruit juices can be nutrient-dense foods providing potassium, magnesium, folate, calcium, vitamins A and C, and soluble fiber, as well as an array of bioactive substances, including carotenoids and flavonoids. “Nutritional guidance encourages consumption of fruit as part of a balanced and healthy diet, although guidance often recommends limited consumption of fruit in the form of juice citing concerns over a lack of fiber and the potential for excessive energy intake. Juices also tend to have moderately high-glycemic index ratings, indicating a relatively rapid and high post-prandial glucose response as compared with foods with a lower glycemic index,” stated the researchers, led by Mary M. Murphy of the Center for Chemical Regulation & Food Safety in Washington, DC.Diets lower in these types of simple carbohydrates may be relevant for the prevention and management of some chronic diseases, including type 2 DM.The researchers published their results online December 15, 2017 in Journal of Nutritional Science.A systematic review quantitatively summarized results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of 100% fruit juice on glucose–insulin homeostasis. Using data from 18 RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (16 studies), fasting blood insulin (11 studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 7 studies) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; 3 studies) between the 100% fruit juice intervention and control groups.The results show 100% fruit juice, as compared with the control group,  had no significant effect on:Fasting blood glucose (−0.13 mmol/L)Fasting blood insulin (−0.24 pmol/L)HOMA-IR (−0.22) or HbA1c (−0.001)Results from stratified analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100% fruit juice and the measures of glucose control.“The available RCT indicate that repeated intake of 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on glycemic control or measures of insulin resistance,” the researchers stated."
Question:Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?

no

Evidence:"Magnet therapy or wearing copper jewelry may seem attractive for easing your arthritis pain simply and inexpensively. But studies confirm these treatments are ineffective for arthritis pain. According to studies published over the years, magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets don’t work on arthritis pain or stiffness. Placebo-controlled trials have been done in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A few small studies showed that magnets may offer some pain benefit in osteoarthritis, but these results have not been replicated or expanded to larger trials. “In my research I set out to confuse the heck out of participants so they couldn't tell which device was real and which was a placebo,” says one researcher, Stewart Richmond, PhD, research fellow at the University of York, in England."

Evidence:"The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness."

Evidence:"Many people get too much sodium, mostly from processed foods and restaurant fare rather than from salt you add to your diet.Research has not shown that Himalayan salt has any unique health benefits compared to other dietary salt. The mineral impurities that give it a pink color, often promoted as healthful, are far too low in concentration to help with your nutrition. You would have to eat a lethal amount of sodium to achieve helpful quantities of the other minerals.Himalayan salt may be good for skin conditions like eczema, although this has not been proven and may also depend on where it’s sourced. The National Eczema Association recommends adding a cup of salt to bathwater as a relief for eczema flare-ups. While the association's recommendation refers to table salt, pink Himalayan salt could also work.Himalayan Salt Health RisksHimalayan salt carries the same risks as any other type of dietary sodium. Getting too much sodium, from any source, can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension), which can worsen many health conditions and raises the risk for heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions."
