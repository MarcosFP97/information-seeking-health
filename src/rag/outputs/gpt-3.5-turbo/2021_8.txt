Believe it or not, duct tape was originally described by the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics as a treatment for plantar warts on the feet. It works by stripping away the top layer of the wart and suffocates the aerobic virus, which needs air to survive. Another way duct tape works is in conjunction with medication by “revving up” the medication you’re putting on the wart because of improved penetration into the skin."

Evidence:"However, the correlation between diet diversity and immune-mediated skin diseases is still up to interpretation. Several supplements have been studied, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. Most studies agree that combining vitamin B12, folic acid, and sun exposure is good for inducing repigmentation. Supplementation of zinc and phenylalanine when used in conjunction with topical steroids or UV-B (ultraviolet B) treatment shows therapeutic effects on vitiligo due to their role in the melanin synthesis pathway. Investigations conducted on herbal supplements have revealed that most of them contain antioxidants, which aid in repigmentation.

Evidence:"Adequate levels of zinc are needed to create new cells, particularly collagen and fibre-like tissues required for repairing damaged cells. On top of this, zinc's function of supporting immune cell activity is also needed to combat inflammation from a wound.Why is zinc important during pregnancy?Zinc plays such an important role in helping cells to grow and multiply and adequate levels of zinc are needed during periods of rapid growth like pregnancy.One study that examined the effect of zinc supplementation during pregnancy noted that many people of childbearing age may be experiencing mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc status may cause preterm birth and there is evidence to suggest zinc deficiency may actually prolong labour.Researchers also measured child development outcomes and noted that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well.The authors of this literature review found a small but significant reduction in preterm birth for the zinc supplemented group compared to the placebo group.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently published a report on zinc supplementation during pregnancy which highlighted that zinc is not stored in the body, so physiological needs must be met through dietary intake (including zinc supplements).The WHO report noted the importance of the mineral in many biological processes relating to pregnancy as it contributes to human growth and development, supporting the healthy growth of the foetal nervous system as well as the aforementioned immune-boosting role.Maternal zinc supplementation can help counteract any risks associated with maternal or gestational zinc deficiency, such as:Reduced fertilityFoetal neurological malformationsSlow or inhibited growth (small for gestational age)Congenital malformationsPostpartum haemorrhagePre-eclampsiaThe WHO report makes note of the fact that overall nutrition is important for maternal and infant health, so while taking a specific zinc supplement may not cause harm, it's best to keep the bigger picture in mind.When considering prenatal zinc supplementation, it is recommended pregnant women look for one that contains a range of nutrients to aim for an optimal pregnancy and infant outcome.This evidence-backed oral zinc supplementation is a safe and handy way of ensuring you are receiving your daily zinc supplementation, as well as many other nutrients required for maternal and infant health.How much zinc is safe in pregnancy?Current recommendations in Australia about dietary zinc intake advise that pregnant people need about 10 to 11mg of zinc per day. To put that into context, the recommended daily intake of zinc for a typical adult woman is around 8mg per day.So when aiming for an optimal pregnancy outcome, the additional amount required shouldn't be too difficult for the average person to consume.Additionally, it's important for pregnant people to keep their nutrition in mind after childbirth as well, as breastfeeding can affect zinc status and deplete normal zinc levels.Is too much zinc harmful?As with a lot of nutrition advice, the recommended daily intakes are based on that 'sweet spot' between too little and too much. Too much zinc can be harmful to pregnant people (as well as the greater population) and can lead to zinc toxicity.Symptoms of zinc toxicity may include:NauseaVomitingStomach pain/acheDiarrhoeaHeadachesIf high levels of zinc are consumed over a long period, this can result in chronic zinc toxicity, which can lead to low levels of high-density lipoprotein ('good' cholesterol), decreased immune function and copper deficiency.How much is 'too much' zinc?One way to think about the recommended daily intake (RDI) of a vitamin or mineral is that the RDI sits in the middle of a spectrum. On one end you have deficiency, and on the other you have toxicity.Toxicity occurs when a person exceeds what's known as the tolerable upper level (UL) — that is, the maximum amount consumed before it becomes harmful.For maternal zinc intakes, the tolerable upper level for zinc is 40mg across all adult populations.Is vitamin C and zinc safe during pregnancy?Both vitamin C and zinc are two of the many essential vitamins and minerals the body needs for optimum health but are especially important during pregnancy.These vitamins and minerals not only help foetal growth but support the immune system to support pregnancy outcomes for both the parent and the growing baby."

Light therapySome people with SAD find that light therapy can help improve their mood considerably. This involves sitting by a special lamp called a light box, usually for around 30 minutes to an hour each morning.Light boxes come in a variety of designs, including desk lamps and wall-mounted fixtures. They produce a very bright light. The intensity of the light is measured in lux – the higher lux, the brighter the light.The light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months.It's thought the light may improve SAD by encouraging your brain to reduce the production of melatonin (a hormone that makes you sleepy) and increase the production of serotonin (a hormone that affects your mood).Sunrise alarm clocks, which gradually light up your bedroom as you wake up, may also be useful for some people.Who can use light therapy?Most people can use light therapy safely."

Evidence:"Should you use toothpaste on pimples?The reasoning behind using toothpaste on pimples is simple: Toothpaste typically contains ingredients like baking soda and alcohol, which can dry out a zit and get rid of it — or at least make it less obvious. “Toothpaste can dry out a pimple because of the drying ingredients it contains,” says Dr. Marie Hayag, a New York-based board certified dermatologist. “But these ingredients, which include alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, sodium lauryl sulfate, herbal extracts and oils, and propylene glycol, can also irritate your skin by causing redness and peeling.” So, yes, toothpaste will probably get rid of acne, but it could end up doing more harm than good. You could be left with overly dry, irritated skin that’s just as frustrating as that pimple would have been. Fortunately, toothpaste is definitely not your only option for an effective spot treatment. “There are safer, more appropriate treatments that can treat the acne and not just dry it out,” says Hayag."

Evidence:"That sense of euphoria is thought to be due to the release of endorphins in the brain in response to sustained physical activity.“Endorphins reduce your perception of pain and trigger a positive feeling in the body,” says Sanam Hafeez, PsyD, a neuropsychologist and the director of Comprehensive Consultation Psychological Services in New York City. Exercise also has a host of physical benefits that can make you feel better overall by decreasing muscle tension, improving sleep quality, and reducing anxiety, she notes.So which workouts fight depression best? “To date, the strongest evidence seems to support aerobic exercise,” says Dr. Muzina. This includes running, swimming, walking, hiking, aerobics classes, dancing, cross-country skiing, and kickboxing.According to the Mayo Clinic, engaging in at least 30 minutes of exercise on three to five days of the week could significantly lessen depressive symptoms. And if you’re short on time, even a 10- to 15-minute spurt of exercise could make a difference, the Mayo Clinic reports.362Lift Your Mood by Lifting Some WeightsStocksyStrength-training exercises also help relieve symptoms of depression, according to an analysis of 21 studies, which was published in August 2020 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Similarly, a review of studies published in June 2018 in JAMA Psychiatry showed that adults who exercise with weights are less likely to develop depression than those who never exercise with weights.How do barbells and similar equipment brighten one’s mood?"

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"This include eating large clumps of rice, gargling with vinegar to dissolve the fish bone inside throat, and sticking your finger down the throat to try and dislodge the swallowed fish bone. In our experience, none of these home remedies work and can potentially exacerbate the problem. Many patients ask if there is any medicine for fish bone stuck in throat; or will fish bone dissolve in throat. The answer to these questions, is a firm NO. For a suspected fish bone in the throat, it is best to seek medical attention at either a general practitioner or ENT specialist who can evaluate the condition accurately and provide treatment."
Question:Will drinking vinegar dissolve a stuck fish bone? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"No:
Science simply doesn’t back up the effectiveness of copper or metal bracelets
for arthritis. “It is thought that copper and magnets may help reduce pain and
inflammation from arthritis,” says rheumatologist Nilanjana Bose, MD, an
assistant professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and a
member of the American College of Rheumatology. “Not a substantiated theory in
my opinion. Research has not shown any benefit with use of copper or magnets
for arthritic pain.”
Occupational
therapist Karen Jacobs, EdD, OT, OTR, CPE, FAOTA, who works with arthritis
patients on a regular basis, also doesn’t recommend them. “With copper
bracelets, there isn’t any evidence research to support its use,” says Jacobs, who

Anita Slomski
Correction
Errors in Abstract and Text
Full Text
Key PointsQuestion 
    What is the efficacy of a multispecies probiotic in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children?Findings 
    In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 350 children, a multispecies probiotic had no significant effect on the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile or of unknown etiology, but it reduced the overall risk of diarrhea regardless of the etiology from 32% to 20%, a statistically significant difference.Meaning 
    The use of the studied probiotic formulation may be considered for diarrhea prevention during antibiotic treatment in children. Abstract
Importance 
    The efficacy of multispecies probiotic formulations in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) remains unclear.Objective 
    To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children.Design, Setting, and Participants 
    This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 2018 to May 2021 in a multicenter, mixed setting (inpatients and outpatients). Patients were followed up throughout the intervention period. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months to 18 years, recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, and signed informed consent. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 patients took part in the trial.Interventions 
    A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after.Main Outcomes and Measures 
    The primary outcome was AAD, defined as 3 or more loose or watery stools per day in a 24-hour period, caused either by Clostridioides difficile or of otherwise unexplained etiology, after testing for common diarrheal pathogens. The secondary outcomes included diarrhea regardless of the etiology, diarrhea duration, and predefined diarrhea complications.Results 
    A total of 350 children (192 boys and 158 girls; mean [range] age, 50 [3-212] months) were randomized and 313 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis."

Evidence:"Acetaminophen for Osteoarthritis
Acetaminophen for Osteoarthritis
Examples
Generic Name
Brand Name
acetaminophen
              Tylenol
How It Works
Acetaminophen is an analgesic, which
		  helps relieve pain. (Analgesics do not affect inflammation as nonsteroidal
		  anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, do.) Why It Is Used
Doctors use acetaminophen to treat
		  mild to moderate pain caused by
osteoarthritis
. If acetaminophen does not
		  relieve pain, or if joint tissue shows signs of inflammation, NSAIDs may be
		  used. How Well It Works
Regular use of acetaminophen can
		  provide relief of mild to moderate pain caused by osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen does not appear to work quite as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
		  drugs for osteoarthritis."

Evidence:"In March, I could barely hit a drum, and just a few months later, I can spend half an hour pounding my heart out.Now I feel that music is mine.Music is everyone’s, and through it we can better understand our stories, anxieties, and depressions.If we can successfully place our worries into sound, perhaps we can release them.There's Much More to Learn About Art TherapyA study published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology in March 2015 showed that music therapy significantly improved symptoms of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem in male Chinese prisoners. Benefits may go beyond mental health. A small pilot study published in July 2016 in Indian Journal of Palliative Care suggests that, in addition to standard palliative care, music therapy is effective in reducing pain in cancer patients with moderate to severe pain.Music therapy (and art therapy in general) is an emerging field. A review published in Frontiers in Psychology in August 2018 looked at 17 art therapy studies and concluded that more research needs to be done on certain populations in order to determine who is best suited for this new treatment.One Year Later: My Personal Research FindingsAs for the effectiveness of music therapy in my own life? I can tell you this: Since starting music therapy a year ago I have stopped taking antidepressants and have been able to notice how many of my mental health issues stem from childhood sexual abuse.

PUFAs a Promising Add-On for Borderline Personality Disorder
Batya Swift Yasgur, MA, LSW
July 26, 2021
Marine omega-3 fatty acids may be a promising add-on therapy for improving symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), new research suggests. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials showed that adjunctive omega-3 fatty polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) significantly reduced overall BPD symptom severity, particularly affect dysregulation and impulsive behavior. "Given the mechanisms of action and beneficial side effect profile, this [analysis] suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could be considered as add-on treatment" for patients with BPD, senior author Roel J. T. Mocking MD, PhD, resident in psychiatry and postdoctoral researcher at Academisch Medisch Centrum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, told Medscape Medical News. The findings were published online recently in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Urgent Need 
"There are several effective treatments, but not all patients respond sufficiently," which points to an urgent need for additional treatment options, Mocking said. He noted that although "several prior studies showed promising effects of omega-3 fatty acids" for patients with BPD, those studies were relatively small, which precluded more definitive overall conclusions."
Question:Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
yes

Evidence:"[iii] However, being outdoors is great for your immune system and overall health and wellbeing, so try to spend some time outdoors each day – just remember to be SunSmart while doing so! There continues to be interest and research into the potential role of Vitamin D in asthma management and prevention. A 2016 review of nine previous double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled trials of Vitamin D in children and adults with asthma, found Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations but did not improve lung function or day to day asthma symptoms. [ii] However, more research is needed to understand whether these effects are for all patients or only those with low Vitamin D levels to start with, implications for people with severe asthma, and the dose that is required. Asthma Australia are proud to be funding research investigating Vitamin D levels during pregnancy and the impact on the respiratory outcomes of the infants. This project will hopefully inform future clinical trials by finding out the ideal time to supplement during pregnancy and what blood Vitamin D level to target, to improve the early life respiratory health of high-risk infants."
Question:Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma? The answer must be yes or no.

Evidence:"If you do give your toddler a reduced-fat milk, such as soy milk, be sure to make up for that missed fat in other parts of your child's diet. When to Avoid Soy Formula  
Soy formula is not recommended unless a baby has a rare health condition or a family is strictly vegetarian or vegan. In addition, soy formula is not recommended for some specific situations. Avoid soy baby formula for:
Colic or fussiness, since the switch will likely not be helpful
A cow's milk protein allergy, because many infants who have a cow's milk allergy are also allergic to soy proteins and would benefit more from drinking an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula instead
A high risk for food allergies, since soy is among the most common allergens
Premature babies, since soy formula can lead to decreased bone mineralization, even when babies are given supplemental calcium
Unless there is a good reason to start your baby on soy formula, if you stop breastfeeding before your baby is 12 months old or need to supplement, it is best to start with a cow's milk-based formula rather than soy formula. Health and Hype of the Latest Baby Formula Trends
   A Word From Verywell  
Unless your baby has a rare health condition or your family's diet is strictly plant-based, soy formula is generally not recommended. Infants with cow’s milk sensitivities or allergies may also have the same reactions to soy, in which case, hypoallergenic formulas are often a better alternative."
Question:Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies? The answer must be yes or no.
Your answer:
no

Evidence:"The observed weight loss in chitosan group is in contrast to only 0.3 kg weight loss in placebo group. Also significant was the percentage of subjects who lost between 5 and 10 % of body weight after 90 days compared to placebo group (32.4 and 3.3 %, respectively). Although some studies demonstrated that reduction in body weight by administration of chitosan can be achieved in individuals given a hypocaloric or standardized diet [14, 29], other studies show efficacy of chitosan for persons without diet restrictions [10, 23, 30, 31]. The results of our study confirm that indeed significant weight loss can be achieved in subjects adhering to a non-restrictive diet [10, 23, 30, 31]. Reasons for the difference in results in our study with other reported studies could be difference in diets, dosage and timing of chitosan administration or protocol variability such as life style recommendations.One factor which is important to consider is the timing of chitosan ingestion before meals. It is typically recommended that chitosan supplements be ingested approximately 15 min to 1 h prior to a meal in order to allow sufficient time for chitosan to dissolve in the stomach acid[18]."
Question:Does chitosan help lose body weight? The answer must be yes or no.
