Evidence:"However, it is unknown if treatment with Vitamin D can reduce the associated risk of COVID-19 infection, which is the focus of this study. In the population of US veterans, we show that Vitamin D2 and D3 fills were associated with reductions in COVID-19 infection of 28% and 20%, respectively [(D3 Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.80, [95% CI 0.77, 0.83]), D2 HR = 0.72, [95% CI 0.65, 0.79]]. Mortality within 30-days of COVID-19 infection was similarly 33% lower with Vitamin D3 and 25% lower with D2 (D3 HR = 0.67, [95% CI 0.59, 0.75]; D2 HR = 0.75, [95% CI 0.55, 1.04]). We also find that after controlling for vitamin D blood levels, veterans receiving higher dosages of Vitamin D obtained greater benefits from supplementation than veterans receiving lower dosages. Veterans with Vitamin D blood levels between 0 and 19 ng/ml exhibited the largest decrease in COVID-19 infection following supplementation. Black veterans received greater associated COVID-19 risk reductions with supplementation than White veterans."

Loading... The TGA is aware of anecdotal reports circulating in the media of an association between the use of ibuprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID) and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.We have investigated this safety concern and found that there is currently no published peer-reviewed scientific evidence to support a direct link between use of ibuprofen and more severe infection with COVID-19.We will continue to monitor this issue.Information for consumersIf you are concerned that you may have symptoms of COVID-19, you should seek advice from a health professional about how to manage your symptoms and whether you require testing.As with all medicines, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) can cause side effects (also known as adverse events). The risk of harmful side effects increases if you use a medicine in a way other than as recommended.NSAIDs that are available over-the-counter carry instructions/warnings on their label, including that:they should not be used if you have heart failure or impaired kidney function they should not be used for more than a few days at a time unless advised by a doctor the recommended dose should not be exceeded.If you are currently taking ibuprofen, or another NSAID, for management of a chronic health problem, do not stop taking your medication without discussing this first with your treating doctor.Information for health professionalsWhen considering treatment for pain or fever in patients with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, you should refer to any relevant Australian clinical guidelines and carefully consider the risks and benefits of the available treatment options on a case-by-case basis.If you observe any adverse events that suggest a potential link between the use of ibuprofen, or any other medicine, and worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, please report it to the TGA (see 'Reporting problems' below).Reporting problemsConsumers and health professionals are encouraged to report problems with medicines or vaccines. Your report will contribute to the TGA's monitoring of these products.The TGA cannot give advice about an individual's medical condition. You are strongly encouraged to talk with a health professional if you are concerned about a possible adverse event associated with a medicine or vaccine. Topics

Evidence:"Gargling also cut the length of their cold by almost two days. Anti-viral effects
Researchers at the University of Edinburgh say the sea salt may work by boosting cells’ antiviral defence that kicks in when they are affected by a cold. The team has re-examined the data and discovered the same benefits were also experienced by those participants who were infected with one of the four common coronaviruses known to cause colds. Researchers now aim to investigate whether the same solution will benefit those who are experiencing symptoms of the new strain of coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. Recent symptoms
The study is recruiting adults in the UK with recent COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed case of COVID-19. Those who join the trial will be asked to follow government advice on hygiene and self-isolation, with one group asked to gargle and clear their nose with salt water."

12 July 2021
PODGORICA, 11 JULY 2021 – Almost one-third of the citizens of Montenegro (31%) believe that 5G technology causes or spreads coronavirus and that this is being kept secret so that the companies dealing with this technology can continue to make a significant profit. This is one of the findings from a March survey on a nationally representative sample conducted by the research agency Ipsos, with the support of the British Embassy in Podgorica and UNICEF. UNICEF's Young Reporters analysed this conspiracy theory in Montenegro to check if there was any truth in it. Their analysis is available on UNICEF Montenegro's website and it shows that the fifth generation of mobile internet does not kill the living world or spread coronavirus. Younger citizens aged 18–44 years, as well as citizens with higher education, believe this conspiracy theory less often."

Detailed Description:
Background:
COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Studies have pointed out that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Yinqiao powder has been analyzed by network pharmacology and it may be through Interleukin-6, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3, Tumor necrosis factor and Tumor protein p53 pathways treat COVID-19 infection [1]. In addition, the clinical case report pointed out that a 38-year-old woman who currently lives in Wuhan was diagnosed by a Chinese physician and given appropriate Chinese herbal medicine. One week later, the patient's symptoms eased and her lungs CT scan showed that her lungs substantive phenomenon has reduction [2]. Aims of the study:
This study is a prospective observational study with the following three purposes. First, cooperate with the treatment of the domestic temporary diagnosis and treatment guidelines, observe the expression level of the SARS CoV2 virus of the infected patients, and provide the research and development of effective treatment for the future."

Evidence:"Thus, pneumococcal vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic has become more critical than ever. This review presents positive studies of pneumococcal vaccination in patients with COVID-19 and other medical conditions and the correlational effects of pneumococcal disease with COVID-19 to prevent morbidity and mortality from co/secondary infections and superinfections. It also reports the importance and role of pneumococcal vaccination during the current COVID-19 pandemic era to strengthen the global health system.Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Streptococcus pneumoniae, co/secondary infections, superinfections, pneumococcal vaccination1. Overview of COVID-191.1. COVID-19 OutbreakThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 [1].

Evidence:"Here, we propose to uncover the potential sex associated factors using systematic and integrative network analysis. The unique results indicated that estrogens, e.g., estrone and estriol, (1) interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, (2) can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 caused inflammation and immune response signaling in host cells; and (3) estrogens are associated with the distinct fatality rates between male and female COVID-19 patients. Specifically, a high level of estradiol protects young female COVID-19 patients, and estrogens drop to an extremely low level in females after about 55 years of age causing the increased fatality rate of women. In conclusion, estrogen, interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, is an essential sex factor that protects COVID-19 patients from death by inhibiting inflammation and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, medications boosting the down-stream signaling of ESR1/ESR2, or inhibiting the inflammation and immune-associated targets on the signaling network can be potentially effective or synergistic combined with other existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment. IntroductionGlobally, by May 20, 2022, over 520 million1 people were diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."

Evidence:"But one medicine
that patients with COVID-19 may be using to treat a
symptom of the disease could make things worse, lab experiments hint. A common ingredient in cough medicines, dextromethorphan,
stimulated the growth
of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey cells in lab dishes, researchers report April 30 in
Nature. Dextromethorphan seems to
activate a cellular stress-coping process that is also exploited by the virus
for its replication. “We’re not necessarily recommending that
everyone stop taking dextromethorphan,” said Brian Shoichet of the University
of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy. This work is only in lab experiments, he
noted during a news briefing on April 30. In people, cough suppressants have
not been shown to make infections worse."

Face masks prevent the spread of COVID-19
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript. OverviewUsing face masks correctly in public settings helps reduce the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 spreads to people within close contact via small droplets sprayed into the air by someone with the disease who coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. Wearing face masks or cloth face coverings that cover the nose, mouth, and chin and fit snuggly across your cheeks helps reduce the spray of respiratory droplets from the nose and mouth. Wearing a face mask may also protect you from infection."

We have never felt the need to consume English medicine,” said Om Prakash, a person who attended the party.Chakrapani Maharaj, the chief of the All India Hindu Union, posed for photographs as he placed a spoon filled with cow urine near the face of a caricature of the coronavirus.Leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party have advocated the use of cow urine as medicine and a cure for cancer.A leader from India’s north eastern state of Assam told state lawmakers earlier this month during an assembly session that cow urine and cow dung can be used to treat the coronavirus.The pathogen, which has infected more than 138,000 people worldwide and left over 5,000 dead, has no known scientific cure and governments across the world are struggling to control the spread of the pandemic.Writing by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Michael PerryOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

To estimate the impact of the timing and intensity of such measures, we built a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission that incorporates age-stratified risks and contact patterns and projects numbers of hospitalizations, patients in intensive care units, ventilator needs, and deaths within US cities. Focusing on the Austin metropolitan area of Texas, we found that immediate and extensive social distancing measures were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases did not exceed local hospital capacity by early May 2020. School closures alone hardly changed the epidemic curve."

Evidence:"Source: Medical News - Apple Cider Vinegar - COVID-19  Aug 25, 2022  5 months ago
                            Medical researchers from Khwarizmi Institute of Science and Technology-Iran have in a new study involving mice found that apple cider vinegar could be used to treat COVID-19 and also to reduce associated inflammatory responses in COVID-19 especially in the lungs. The study team used a local Iranian apple cider vinegar called D.SAP in the successful animal study and next planning a randomized clinical trial. It should be noted that D.SAP is literally similar to ordinary organic apple cider vinegar. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a virus that may cause severe respiratory disorders also affect the rest of the organs with an unclear rate of death. It has been speculated that natural vinegar may have an immune-boosting quality that effectively fights influenza-like respiratory infections. The study team aimed to evaluate the role of a specially formulated Iranian apple vinegar called Dezhakam sap (D.SAP) in the mice model of covid-19 in the treatment of infection and reduction of COVID-19-associated lung inflammation."

Evidence:"Nuk2013/ShutterstockResearchers in Colorado and India are researching the bark of the neem tree as a way to treat COVID-19. They learned that an extract from the tree bark, Azadirachta indica, may have antiviral benefits and help reduce symptoms in people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The scientists believe Azadirachta indica may act as a pan-antiviral, capable of treating future emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.As the COVID-19 pandemic presses on, researchers continue looking for ways to prevent infection of the virus and treat the disease. Scientists at the University of Colorado and the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research believe that Azadirachta indica, more commonly called neem tree, may be instrumental in the future of the pandemic. The tree is native to India, and practitioners use it within Eastern-based Ayurvedic medicine.A preclinical study, which appears in the journal Virology, examines how the extract from the bark of Azadirachta indica affects human lung cells and mice with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Studying the Azadirachta indica extractAccording to the authors, neem tree bark (NTB) is “antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-allergic, anti-parasitic, and antifungal.” As such, they wanted to learn if NTB extract could aid in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and its replication.“The goal of this research is to develop a neem-based medication that can reduce the risk of serious illness when someone [has an infection] with coronaviruses,” says study co-author Dr. Maria Nagel, research professor in the Department of Neurology and Ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine."

Evidence:"Various combinations/concentrations of black seed oil and Thymoquinone were tested against SARS-CoV-2 MLV pseudovirus particles (pp) by assessing Luciferase activities measured with a Firefly Luciferase Assay Kit (CB- 80552-010, Codex BioSolutions Inc.). It was observed that Thymoquinone seemed to block viral infection. However, at high concentrations Thymoquinone caused cell death indicating cytotoxic effects. To confirm this result, cell growth assays were performed in the presence of Thymoquinone with Codex’s EnerCount cell growth assay kit which measures ATP levels inside the cells.Similarly, in a seropositive HIV infected patient treated with Thymoquinone (10 ml twice/day for 6 months), Onifade et al. (2013) demonstrated a decrease in viral load to an undetectable level within 3 months, an increase in CD4 count, relief of symptoms, and a sustained sero-reversion following COVID-19 therapy. Another investigation on a seropositive HIV-infected woman who received Thymoquinone (Nigella sativa) and honey treatment (10 ml thrice/day for 1 year) demonstrated prolonged sero-reversion, which the author attributed to Thymoquinone’s possible virucidal effect (Onifade et al., 2015).Akhtar and Riffat (1991) demonstrated the efficacy of a single oral administration of Thymoquinone (Nigella sativa) as powdered seeds and ethanolic extract (40 mg/kg body weight) in reducing the percentage of fecal eggs per Gram in children who were infected with cestodes.In a study conducted on Hepatitis C (HCV) patients, Abdel-Moneim et al."

                            People who consume red wine between one to more than five glasses a week had a 10 to 17% lower risk in contracting COVID-19, but beer drinkers had a heightened risk, according to a recent study. Conducted by researchers from Shenzhen Kangning Hospital and Southwest Hospital, they analysed 473,957 subjects from the UK Biobank cohort to investigate the association between alcohol consumption with COVID-19 risk and mortality. It was also revealed that white wine and champagne drinkers who consume between one to four glasses per week had a 7 to 8% lower risk for COVID-19, compared to non-drinkers. This protective effect was not significant when they consumed five or more glasses per week.Consumers of fortified wine between one to two glasses a week were associated with a 12% lower risk of COVID-19 compared to non-drinkers. Similarly, any consumption three or more glasses a per was not associated with lower COVID-19 risks.The study also investigated other forms of alcohol including beer, cider and spirits.For beer and cider, drinkers had 7 to 28% higher risks of getting COVID-19 regardless of the amount they consumed, compared to non-drinkers.Spirit drinkers also had a higher risk of COVID-19 the more they consumed.Writing in Frontiers of Nutrition​, researchers said: “The COVID-19 risk appears to vary across different alcoholic beverage subtypes, frequency, and amount."

WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients
WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients
20 November 2020
WHO has updated its recommendation on remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.On 22 April 2022, following publication of new data from a clinical trial looking at the outcome of admission to hospital, WHO now suggests the use of remdesivir in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization. Latest information on COVID-19 therapeutics.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.This recommendation, released on 20 November, is part of a living guideline on clinical care for COVID-19. It was developed by an international guideline development group, which includes 28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners and one ethicist. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support. The guidelines are an innovation, matching scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic."

Evidence:"ConclusionsThis review identified six studies that showed that adjunct treatment with different formulations of curcumin led to reductions in typical symptoms, duration of hospitalization, and deaths in COVID-19 patients with different levels of disease severity. At the same time, the curcumin treatment led to the amelioration of cytokine storm manifestation by reducing pro-inflammatory factors and stimulating anti-inflammatory pathways. Thus, these findings suggest that curcumin treatment may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms by restoration of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance. Furthermore, the study by Pawar et al. showed that curcumin-piperine supplementation led to fewer thromboembolic episodes following recovery from COVID-19 infections [39]. Considering that dose-escalating studies have demonstrated the safety of curcumin administration for up to three months [65], we suggest that treatment with this natural compound as a supplement should be evaluated both during and after hospitalization and in the post-vaccination stages to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events."

AbstractIn the WHO European Region, more and more people are shifting towards plant-based diets for reasons relating to health, as well as to ethical considerations about climate change and animal welfare. In some countries changes in dietary patterns are only just emerging, while in others this trend is increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, the evidence on the long-term health impacts of vegetarian and vegan diets remains incomplete. This fact sheet aims to review the current evidence and highlight knowledge gaps in this area."

Evidence:"Studies conducted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that it is safe to get both a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit. A CDC study published  this summer showed people who got a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely (8% to 11%) to have reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only got a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine, but these reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly. The findings of this study are consistent with safety data from clinical trials that did not find any safety concerns with giving both vaccines at the same time. Why should I get a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit? Getting both vaccines at the same time if you are due for both is an option for consumers. Some people might prefer to get their vaccines at one time."

Evidence:"You will be able to get a quick price and instant permission to reuse the content in many different ways. clinical epidemiologycritical careviral infectionrespiratory infectionKey messagesWhat is the key question?Does use of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the rate or worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection?What is the bottom line?Use of ACE-I/ARB was associated neither with a consistently increased rate nor with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with ACE-I/ARB non-use or calcium channel blocker use.Why read on?This population-based study, including all individuals PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark, used extensive confounder adjustment and an active comparator design to examine the association between ACE-I/ARB use and the rate of microbiologically verified SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the associated outcomes including hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation and death.IntroductionThe use of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), has been suggested to increase the risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. ACE-Is/ARBs upregulates the human ACE2 receptor, which facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells.1–5 The initially published studies of ACE-I/ARB users and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported no increased risk or worsened outcome after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or a diagnosis of COVID-19.6–16 However, available studies are limited by incomplete data on recent ACE-I/ARB use and preexisting comorbidities,6 7 9 by restriction to hospitalised or hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 patients,9 10 12–15 or by incomplete follow-up.6 Other limitations have included immortal time bias from inclusion of in-hospital ACE-I/ARB use after COVID-19 diagnosis,10 11 15 16 which may lead to apparently beneficial effects, because ACE-I/ARBs would only be prescribed if patients are haemodynamically stable and have survived until drug initiation. Only few studies on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection included an active comparator.12 13
Major professional societies have called for further high-quality research and issued warnings against ACE-I/ARB discontinuation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,1 17 to avoid worsening of underlying cardiometabolic conditions.18
As ACE-Is/ARBs are widely used drugs, any association with rate of infection or adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an important public health impact. Thus, there is an urgent need to examine the hypotheses of increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsened outcome, among users of ACE-Is/ARBs.MethodsDesign and settingWe conducted this nationwide combined case-control and cohort study in Denmark (population ~5.8 million persons) to study the rate (case-control design) and the prognosis (cohort design) of SARS-CoV-2. Denmark has a uniform tax-supported healthcare system responsible for all acute care in Denmark."

Evidence:"This has led to claims that a ‘smoker’s paradox’ may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells)."

Evidence:"These new studies add evidence that there may be an association between blood type and vulnerability to COVID-19; however, additional research is needed to better understand why and what it means for patients. Individuals with blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 infection
Blood type O may offer some protection against COVID-19 infection, according to a retrospective study. Researchers compared Danish health registry data from more than 473,000 individuals tested for COVID-19 to data from a control group of more than 2.2 million people from the general population. Among the COVID-19 positive, they found fewer people with blood type O and more people with A, B, and AB types. The study results suggest that people with blood types A, B, or AB may be more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than people with type O. The researchers did not find any significant difference in rate of infection between A, B, and AB types."

Evidence:"Additionally, in many more non-fatal methanol poisoning cases, adults and children are now vision-impaired or blind from this toxic alcohol.During situations like pandemics, healthcare institutions may seem dangerous settings, which could pose a risk of viral infection. It is possible that fear of COVID-19 kept methanol poisoning victims from seeking and obtaining timely care. This highlights the importance of early identification and initiation of treatment, which can be supplemented by “active case finding” by treating physicians and public health agencies [5]. Public health messaging and strategic planning are crucial to prevent future methanol outbreaks [6]. Availability of data and materials

Evidence:"Results from one, the RECOVERY study run by U.K. researchers, were released on a preprint server Wednesday and show that not only was there no statistically significant difference between the arms of the trial, the patients on hydroxychloroquine tended to do worse. But proponents, including Navarro, have argued that the drug needs to be used earlier in the disease. The Minnesota study represents the first test of using the drug among patients who have not been hospitalized.advertisement
The Minnesota study is one of a triad of randomized controlled trials, organized by David Boulware, that aimed to test hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy. One tested giving the drug to people after they were exposed to patients with Covid-19; that trial also failed. This trial tested using the drug right after symptoms began. A third study, for which results have not yet been reported, gave hydroxychloroquine to doctors and other people at high risk of getting Covid-19 before they were exposed to the virus."

Evidence:"Unfortunately, our federal and state system for distributing these drugs has failed our most vulnerable patients,” said Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study. Monoclonal antibodies are very effective at treating mild to moderate COVID-19 infection among non-hospitalized patients. But during the pandemic, mAbs have been in short supply. Federal guidelines prioritize patients at higher risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, including older people and those with chronic conditions. The researchers wanted to learn how the limited supply of mAb therapy was allocated to patients at highest risk for severe disease. They looked at data from more than 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between November 2020 and August 2021, and compared rates of receiving mAbs by age, sex, race and ethnicity, region, and number of chronic conditions."

      Breastmilk is the best protection for babies against infections  during COVID-19, says UNICEF
31 July 2021
2021/Khemika
A 3-month old Davin Wannarat has been exclusively breastfed by his mother, Khemika, since birth. Available in:Englishไทย
BANGKOK, 2 August 2021 – Mothers are advised to initiate or continue breastfeeding while practicing good hygiene to help protect their newborns from infections and illness during the COVID-19 pandemic, says UNICEF as the world marks World Breastfeeding Week from 1-7 August. To date, transmission of COVID-19 through breastmilk and breastfeeding has not been detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recommend breastfeeding and applying skin-to-skin contact during feeding even if the mother is suspected or infected with COVID-19. Mothers are also advised to wear a mask, wash their hands and disinfect surfaces regularly during breastfeeding to reduce the risk of transmission. Evidence suggests that the benefits of breastmilk substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and that the antibodies found in breastmilk may help may fight against COVID-19 infection, if a baby is exposed."

Evidence:"However, where my study found that no other vaccine showed any protective effect against case or death rates from COVID-19, the Mayo Clinic study found possible benefits from Hib, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, and influenza vaccination. Taken together, these studies suggest that keeping up one’s vaccinations is one way to lower COVID-19 risks. There are two possible reasons that pneumococcal vaccines in particular may protect against COVID-19. One is that the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases have bacterial co-infections so that vaccination against pneumococci and Hib prevent these super-infections and the pneumonias they cause. Alternatively, pneumococcal vaccines may protect against COVID-19 is by indirectly vaccinating against SARS-CoV-2 itself. In a second paper, published in Vaccines, I report that pneumococcal vaccines contain bacterial cell wall proteins that mimic SARS-CoV-2 proteins."

Evidence:"In the earlier period, fish oil use prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection, as observed in Louca’s study. However, the authors noted no such effect of fish oil used in the later stage when Omicron became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Conclusions
To summarize, the study analysis using a fully-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model showed that habitual fish oil use was consistently associated with a lower risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission and mortality. Also, the population followed up for more than 12.1 years showed no signs of being at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to regular fish oil use. The study shed light on the biological mechanisms which govern fish oil use-related benefits for COVID-19-related outcomes. The main ingredient of fish oil is omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which have powerful anti-inflammatory properties."

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA."

Evidence:"Other examples of coronaviruses include:the common coldMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)Current evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads primarily person-to-person contact through the transmission of respiratory fluids. There’s no evidence that mosquitoes can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to humans.Let’s take a look at why the most recent evidence suggests you can’t get COVID-19 from mosquitoes and also examine what viruses you can get from these insects.Can mosquitoes carry the new coronavirus, and can they transmit it?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there’s no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be carried or transmitted by mosquitoes.In order for a mosquito to transmit a virus, that virus has to first infect the mosquito, pass through its gut, and enter its salivary glands. In a June 2020 study, researchers injected a strand of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into isolated cells of the common Aedes mosquito. The researchers found that the virus was unable to replicate in the cells of this mosquito. In the same study, the researchers collected 1,165 mosquitoes from around the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first outbreak of COVID-19 was recorded. The researchers found that all the collected mosquitoes tested negative for the virus.The first experimental study looking at the potential for mosquitoes to transmit the new coronavirus was published in July 2020."

Evidence:"Ribavirin showed in vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 (24). Ribavirin can be used for COVID-19 (61), and it has also been recommended to use for COVID-19 via intravenous infusion (62), as it binds tightly with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and stops polymerase function (63). However, we need a randomized control trial to elucidate the antiviral potential of ribavirin. Moreover, it should be used in combination with either interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir to enhance its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin
This FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug has been shown to halt the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, as indicated by a several-fold reduction in viral RNA ivermectin-treated samples (64). However, further evaluation is needed to determine its efficacy in combating COVID-19 in humans."
