Evidence:"It is also known as Achilles Tendinitis – where there is an injury to the Achilles tendon where the calf muscle attaches to the heel bone. As a general rule, the best course of treatment is RICE – rest, ice, compression and elevation. The compression part including wearing an ankle brace for tendonitis. There is a variety of ankle braces for tendonitis. However, some ankle braces aren’t right for this type of injury, such as some cam walkers, which are used more for recovery after surgery. The best ankle braces for tendonitis come in different forms, and the choice you make generally comes down to the level of flexibility and protection required for your level of injury and for comfort."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"The rates of death from any cause came in just under 8%.The participants without the deficiency experienced rates of dementia of 3.2%, and the all-cause death rates amounted to almost 4%.After factoring in co-occurring conditions, such as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, cognitive decline, and depression, the researchers associated folate deficiency with a 68% higher risk of a dementia diagnosis.The participants with folate deficiency had three times the risk of dying from any cause.A fresh lookAnat Rotstein, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, was the study’s lead author.In an interview with Medical News Today, Dr. Rotstein discussed the significance of this work:“This study is important because it critically characterizes the association between a widely used and simple-to-measure biomarker serum folate (vitamin B9 in the blood) and the risks of dementia and all-cause mortality.”“It is the first study of serum folate and the risk of dementia to consider two key methodological artifacts: mortality precludes dementia, and reverse causation,” she continued.“Hence, our study provides the best evidence to date regarding the association between serum folate deficiency and all-cause mortality.”David A. Merrill, M.D., Ph.D., is an adult and geriatric psychiatrist and director of the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Pacific Brain Health Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.In an interview with MNT, Dr. Merrill described this study as “newsworthy,” because the role of folate in cognitive health is not well established.He also noted that testing for folate levels “could be helpful […] more as a screening tool” since “deficiencies are associated with symptoms.”Reverse causationDr. Rotstein and her team also investigated the possibility that low folate levels could arise from, not before, preclinical dementia. This is hard to rule out due to the time it takes for cognitive decline to manifest.When the researchers categorized their data by the length of the monitoring period, they could not eliminate the potential role of reverse causation.Dr. Rotstein told MNT, “Our results show moderate evidence for reverse causation in dementia, suggesting that serum folate deficiency may be a consequence of the onset of dementia rather than its cause (not so with all-cause mortality).”If dementia is responsible for the drop in serum folate, it may be a useful marker to help doctors identify people with an increased risk of dementia.The study’s limitationsThe researchers acknowledge that their study has several limitations.Firstly, it only included individuals ages 60–75 years who were chosen to undergo screening for serum folate concentrations. A random sample may have produced more accurate estimates for a broader population.Due to the observational study design, the authors could not confirm that low folate levels cause dementia or early death.Further, serum folate concentrations may not reflect long-term folate levels, because they change with metabolism and food intake.Also, the study did not account for possible undetected genetic risk factors.Public health implicationsThe study’s authors conclude that healthcare professionals should “treat deficiency for [preventive] measures and/or as part of implemented therapeutic strategies while regularly reviewing patients’ clinical outcomes.”Dr. Rotstein was hesitant to recommend regular testing for individuals outside of the study’s age range of 60–75 years.However, Dr. Merrill felt that yearly or biannual testing may be helpful for people with a family history of dementia or approaching middle and later life.The cost-effectiveness of testing is questionable, though, as Dr. Merrill remarked: “You would get arguments on either side."

Evidence:"Patients -- or their parents -- were told to return to the clinic every two to three weeks to repeat the cryotherapy for a maximum of six treatments or until the wart was gone. The results: duct tape won over cryotherapy; 85% of the duct tape patients were wart-free, compared with 60% of the cryotherapy group. In fact, the majority of "duct-taped warts" disappeared within 28 days -- while the majority of cryotherapy-treated warts needed two treatments, spaced at least two weeks apart. The researchers say the duct-tape therapy might work by stimulating the patient's immune system. Show Sources  © 2002 WebMD, Inc. All rights reserved.

During an asthma attack, the airways become narrowed and inflamed. The muscles surrounding them tighten and squeeze, resulting in symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.Treatment for asthma usually involves taking medication, which relaxes the muscles around the airways and reduces swelling and mucus.Some research shows that yoga may be useful as a complementary treatment for asthma. This means that a person would perform it in addition to an existing treatment plan, likely involving medication.A 2016 review of clinical trials involving 1,048 participants found that yoga somewhat improves quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. However, researchers noted that many of the studies were flawed."

Evidence:"In actuality, you should feed both a cold and a fever — and starve neither, says Mark A. Moyad, MD, MPH, Jenkins/Pokempner director of preventive and alternative medicine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.“When you have a cold or a fever, your immune system is fighting off an infection, and eating less during the early stages of an infection can actually be dangerous,” he explains. “The body requires large amounts of energy to create and assemble the large number of immune cells necessary to fight the enemy. Good nutrition and calories provide this energy. "That’s especially true for people with less robust immune systems (such as very young children, the elderly, and people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, or autoimmune disorders, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis), who may suffer more serious colds and infections if they take in too few high-quality nutrients, Dr. Moyad says.Editor's PicksDo I Have a Cold or the Flu?Figuring out if you have a cold or the flu can be difficult.

When it comes to cancer, can selenium supplements help? Past research on the topic has had conflicting results, while recent research suggests that they may do more harm than good. (2)
What the research tells us
In the past, studies showed that taking selenium as a supplement helped prevent people from getting cancer. However, a more recent systematic review suggests that this might not be true. This review looked at many different types of cancer – including head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, skin, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and blood cancer – and found no evidence that selenium supplements reduced cancer risk. Selenium supplements were also associated with side effects such as an upset stomach."

Oral evening primrose oil and borage oil for eczema 
    Your browser does not support the audio element. Read podcast transcript and more►
Eczema is an itchy and red skin condition, which may affect 20% of people world wide at some time in their life. Though it may improve with age, there is no cure. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are.Conventional medical treatments make life better for people; however, some people who do not see an adequate improvement in their eczema or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, turn to complementary alternatives to conventional medical treatment. This review is of two such products: evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth), which have been thought to have benefits for eczema.We included 27 studies, with 1596 adults and children from 12 countries."

Evidence:"For maximum effectiveness, ankle braces should fit comfortably in the shoes you wear during an activity, which also helps with brace use compliance. After experiencing an ankle injury, it is important to consider rehabilitation as part of your treatment plan. Often, when an athlete still is having ankle pain or isn’t back to full function, it is because he or she hasn’t allowed for enough time to properly heal. Following an ankle injury, your provider may recommend rehabilitation services. Balance, range of motion, strength and endurance are important therapy and training factors that rehabilitation providers specialize in for recovery. Performing exercises as directed helps ensure a safe return to activity and lessens the likelihood for re-injury."

According to a study by Healthline, it was concluded that topically applying Vitamin E on scars could be effective in preventing the appearance of scar tissue before and after surgery. This makes it an ideal scar treatment for black skin. Likewise, a lot of people have admitted experiencing the positive effects of using Vitamin E creams for scars like acne scars which tend to recover faster. Technically, the fact that Vitamin E is fat-soluble and absorbs seamlessly into the skin means it gets depleted easily when exposed to ultraviolet rays. With this knowledge, applying Vitamin E topically can boost its replenishment on the skin."

Magnesium has also been studied for the acute, as-needed treatment of severe, difficult-to-treat migraine. Magnesium sulfate given intravenously was most effective in those with a history of migraine with aura. In those without a history of aura, no difference was seen in immediate pain relief or nausea relief by magnesium. Still, there was less light and noise sensitivity after the infusion. Magnesium oxide, in tablet form, is inexpensive, does not require a prescription, and may be considered reasonable prevention in those who have a history of aura, menstrually related migraine, no health insurance, or who may become pregnant."

Evidence:"That’s in addition to a person’s genetics and the environment they live in. However, healthy bacteria and organic proteins present in certain fermented milks could control this microbiota and therefore help to reduce high blood pressure. “New evidence suggests that antihypertensive fermented milks, including probiotics, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides obtained from milk fermented with specific lactic acid bacteria, may modulate gut microbiota,” Dr. Vallejo-Córdoba reports. “Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milks with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects.”
The researchers say they will need to perform more studies to understand the antihypertensive effects of fermented milks. High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and is one of the leading causes of death globally. Healthy gut bacteria influences intestinal development, barrier integrity and function, body metabolism, the immune system, and the central nervous system."

Evidence:""Beyond setting our circadian clock, light exposure also seems to affect higher-functioning areas of the brain," he says. That’s why light therapy may help treat SAD, which, like major depression, can also be treated with medications and therapy. Light therapy may prompt improvement with few side effects
For both SAD and other types of depression, light therapy has unique characteristics that make it an attractive alternative to medications, Dr. Schwartz notes. Antidepressant drugs often take several weeks to start working, and sometimes cause bothersome side effects including nausea, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. In people who respond well to light therapy, depression symptoms usually start improving within a week, and the side effects, which include eye strain and headaches, are uncommon and mild. For people with depression who are pregnant or elderly, trying light therapy makes sense because these groups often need to avoid or reduce medication use."

Evidence:"These include ibuprofen, which is known by the brand names of Motrin and Advil; and naproxen, which is known as Aleve. People can also choose to take aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) for migraines, but since the mechanism of a migraine headache involves inflammation and Tylenol doesn’t have the anti-inflammatory properties, it’s less effective in this case.Are there over-the-counter pain medications specifically for migraines?There are. Excedrin is a good example — it has a combination of acetaminophen, aspirin and caffeine. Caffeine is particularly useful in battling a migraine because caffeine will cause blood vessels that have been inflamed by the migraine headache to constrict and shrink back down.When should a migraine sufferer consider asking for prescription treatment?The key to knowing when to move to stronger treatment is frequency and intensity. Are you getting several migraine headaches a month? And when you get them, are you finding that Advil, Aleve or other over-the-counter medications aren’t strong enough to truly kick them to the curb?"

Some readers may have strong feelings about the Harry Hoxsey cancer treatment story. We present this chapter on the herbal ingredients in Hoxsey’s formula from Kenny Ausubel’s new book When Healing Becomes a Crime—the study of this Dallas-based promoter of natural cancer cures. Modern research has revealed that many of the herbs in this formula contain compounds that have exhibited antioxidant and/or anti-tumor properties in experimental studies. In light of this data, author Ausubel asks whether this formula might be potentially useful in cancer treatment. We publish this chapter with the intention of stimulating discussion on the potential role of herbs and other natural products in the prevention and treatment of cancer and other serious illness and to draw attention to a fascinating chapter in American medical history."

Evidence:"There are several home remedies to treat lice; applying mayonnaise in hair being one of them. Mayonnaise is a combination of egg yolks, vinegar, and vegetable oils. Many people use mayonnaise in an effort to find a safe and more natural lice remedy. To effectively get rid of lice, you need to get rid of both the parasites and the nits. The theory behind mayonnaise is that it will help “suffocate” the lice so that they die off."
Question:Can applying mayonnaise help get rid of lice?

Evidence:"Hence iron alone is not sufficient to treat any anemic condition. So the notion that iron alone causes anemia is not true. People wrongly think that consuming dates daily will treat their anemic condition. First and foremost, they need to find out the root cause of anemia. It can be due to simple nutritional reasons or can be due to blood loss too."
Question:Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?

No

Mix about 2 tablespoons of vinegar in a cup of water and then drink it.3. Carbonated/aerated beverages have been used by ENT specialists to remove food stuck in your throats.When soda enters your stomach, it releases gasses. These gases help break down the bone and build up pressure which travels up your throat and can dislodge the stuck fish bone.4. Swallowing a large piece of bread soaked in water."

Evidence:"Sometimes, their symptoms are mild, but in some cases, they are severe.Respiratory tract infections can develop due to bacteria or viruses and include influenza, the common cold, and COVID-19.Researchers are constantly examining treatment options that could improve the symptoms, shorten their duration, or prevent them entirely.A recent study, which appears in the journal BMJ Open, reports that taking zinc might shorten the duration of respiratory tract infection symptoms and possibly prevent them.What is zinc?Zinc supports the immune system and plays a role in a range of bodily functions, including:cell division and growthwound healingthe sense of smell and tastebreakdown of carbohydratesenhancement of insulin actionFoods that contain zinc include oysters, red meat, chicken, seafood, beans, nuts, whole grains, and dairy products. It is also available in nasal sprays and gels and some cold lozenges.Most people in the United States derive enough zinc from the food they eat. However, researchers are still trying to determine the benefits of taking zinc as a supplement. Some scientists focus on how zinc might protect against viral infections.Respiratory tract infectionsThe respiratory tract consists of the structures involved in breathing, such as the nose, throat, voice box, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.Symptoms of respiratory tract infections can vary. For example, symptoms of the common cold can include sneezing, a sore throat, a cough, or a runny nose.Symptoms of flu can be more serious, such as fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, and headache.People with COVID-19 may experience some flu-like symptoms."

Evidence:"One 2013 study looked at the effects of several wearable devices, including copper bracelets, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The study followed 65 participants who each wore either a magnetic wrist strap or copper bracelet for arthritis then self-reported their results. The study found that none of the devices had a statistically significant effect in reducing arthritis symptoms. People didn’t experience better physical function or lower medication use when wearing any of the devices. Researchers concluded that copper bracelets don’t have any meaningful effect, except perhaps a limited placebo effect, on rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. A placebo effect happens when someone is undergoing treatment or taking a drug experiences positive effects that aren’t the result of the medication or therapy."
Question:Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?

No

Evidence:"TreatmentIf your athlete's foot doesn't respond to nonprescription products and self-care, you may need to see a doctor to get a prescription-strength cream or ointment, such as clotrimazole (Lotrisone), econazole (Ecoza, Spectazole) or ciclopirox (Loprox, Penlac). If you have a more serious infection, your doctor might prescribe antifungal pills, such as terbinafine (Lamisil) or itraconazole (Sporanox, Tolsura). Or you might need both topical and oral medicine. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic
Lifestyle and home remediesThese tips can help you ease the symptoms of athlete's foot or avoid a recurrence:
Keep your feet clean and dry. Wash your feet twice a day and gently towel-dry between the toes. Use an antifungal product."

Evidence:"Testing has not shown much promise for cocoa butter's use with stretch marks. Researchers have found that, instead of using just cocoa butter, using vitamin E may be an effective and natural way to reduce stretch marks. This vitamin was able to reduce both existing stretch marks and the number of oncoming stretch marks resulting from pregnancy. Vitamin E is a collection of fat-soluble compounds that act as antioxidants and is found naturally in many seeds and nuts. Cocoa butter is the fat of the cocoa bean. Cocoa butter is still a viable solution to reduce stretch marks, because it is typically sold with additives, like vitamin E or, more specifically, alpha tocopherol."
Question:Does cocoa butter help reduce pregnancy stretch marks?

No

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"You and your doctor should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs. Acetaminophen
For years, doctors recommended acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) for OA. But recent studies suggest that acetaminophen does little for OA pain. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Arthritis Foundation (AF) treatment guidelines released in 2020 don’t recommend it unless you can’t use NSAIDs. But it may help OA pain for some people. Acetaminophen can harm your liver, so never take more than prescribed and only use it as needed."
Question:Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?

No

Evidence:"Therefore, music therapy can be used to help anybody who is struggling from depression.The different types of music therapy that are used are known as receptive music therapy and active music therapy. In receptive music therapy, the patient listens to live or recorded music that their therapist recommends/ selects for them to best address their needs. Receptive music therapy has also shown to be effective in easing anxiety issues in patients undergoing surgery. In active music therapy, the patients actually participate in the process of creating music. This is typically done by having the patient learn to sing or play an instrument. Improvisation is often encouraged by the mental health professional in order to help the patient explore their feelings and emotions."

Evidence:"Subjects given omega-3 saw a greater decrease in aggression and depression scores by the end of the trial. Source: Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment of Women With Borderline Personality Disorder: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study
Top Questions and AnswersThe relationship between carbs and depression.Can depression increase your risk of stroke?Shift Work & Mental HealthFinal thoughts
This sample was small and only included women, which means the results can not be generalized to an entire population. However, it does begin painting a picture of how omega-3 may benefit borderline patients. Omega-3 is used to treat symptoms, not a particular disease. This can be both positive and negative in mental health care.. By only treating symptoms, omega-3 is not targeting the root causes of a disease and therefore cannot be a cure. On the other hand, omega-3 can be used to treat a variety of mental health disorders that exhibit aggressive and depressive symptoms, not just borderline personality disorder."
Question:Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?

Yes

Evidence:"If your infant has allergic proctocolitis or enterocolitis, they have a 25 to 60% chance of reacting to soy formulas. Other options below may be more appropriate for your child. Partially Hydrolyzed Formulas (e.g., Enfamil NeuroPro™ Gentlease®, Gerber® Good Start® Gentle or Similac® Pro-Total Comfort™)
Partially hydrolyzed formulas take cow’s milk proteins (whey, casein) and break them into smaller pieces. Some formulas have a whey and casein blend that is partially hydrolyzed, while others may have 100% whey protein that is hydrolyzed. These formulas are NOT used for infants allergic to cow’s milk. Extensively Hydrolyzed Formulas (e.g., Enfamil® Nutramigen®, Enfamil® Pregestimil®, Similac® Alimentum® or  Similac® Expert Care®)
Extensively hydrolyzed formulas offer complete nutrition for infants who are allergic to cow’s milk protein."
Question:Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?

No.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Researchers found that chitosan preparations resulted in significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo. Plus, treatment groups experienced a decrease in total cholesterol and blood pressure. That said, researchers indicate that, overall, the trials in this review were of poor quality, and more evidence is needed to prove that chitosan helps weight loss. Another review, this one published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, tested the evidence for chitosan, among other commonly used supplements for weight loss like garcinia cambogia and guar gum, to find that there’s no convincing evidence that these supplements work to reduce body weight. A study published in Obesity Reviews found that the effects of chitosan on body weight was minimal and “unlikely to be of clinical significance,” according to researchers. 2."
Question:Does chitosan help lose body weight?

No

Review question
        Do supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile men? Background
        A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. Many subfertile men undergoing fertility treatment also take dietary supplements in the hope of improving their fertility. Fertility treatment can be a very stressful time for men and their partners. It is important that these couples have access to high-certainty evidence that will allow them to make informed decisions on whether to take a supplemental antioxidant."
