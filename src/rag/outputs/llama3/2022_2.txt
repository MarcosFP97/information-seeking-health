Evidence:"Black tea may be the best choice because it may have more tannins than other types of teas. Allow the tea bag to cool slightly, squeeze out some of the water and place the tea bag over the extraction site. Gently bite on the tea bag for at least 5 minutes. Up to 15 if bleeding was heavy. The pressure and the tannins help to form a blood clot in the tooth socket
These techniques are also very helpful. Eat soft and healthy foods, drink plenty of liquids, and get plenty of rest with your head slightly elevated (two pillows)."

Evidence:"Proponents of this technique believe that crystals act as conduits for healing — enabling positive, healing energy to flow into the body as negative, disease-causing energy flows out. But despite the fact that crystal healing has seen an upsurge in popularity in recent years, this alternative treatment is not popular with most medical doctors and scientists, many of whom refer to crystal healing as a pseudoscience. Scientifically speaking, there is no evidence that crystal healing can be used to cure diseases, because diseases have never been found to be the result of a so-called energy flow in the body. Furthermore, no scientific studies have shown that crystals and gems can be differentiated by chemical composition or color to treat a particular ailment. "I am not aware of any [National Science Foundation]-supported studies into the healing powers of crystals," Peter Heaney, a mineral sciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, told the "Washington Post (opens in new tab)" in 2021. He goes on to explain that while crystals can be said to have energy, in accordance with Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence of e=mc^2, there is no energy transfer between crystals and human beings.Nevertheless, healing crystals remain popular at health spas and at New Age health clinics, sometimes incorporated into related practices of massage and Reiki."

Evidence:"This was, however, a small study and included only 39 subjects. A systematic review focusing on osteoarthritis and cartilage repair found that collagen hydrolysate and undenatured collagen showed some potential as an option for managing osteoarthritis, but further investigation is needed before any definite conclusion on their effectiveness can be made. Uses in Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) happens when the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells by mistake, causing painful swelling mainly in the hand, wrist, and knee joints. In RA, the lining of the joint becomes inflamed, damaging the joint tissue. Research studying the use of collagen supplements in RA has yielded mixed results as well. A study that looked at both OA and RA noted that reports of positive results with oral collagen in RA remain controversial, particularly when compared with conventional therapies such as methotrexate, a drug designed to slow down the progression of RA."

Evidence:"Why has there been concern that cell phones may cause cancer? There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems: Cell phones emit radiation (in the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones would be of concern given how many people use them. Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health. However, the evidence to date suggests that cell phone use does not cause brain or other kinds of cancer in humans."

Chances are you’ve used baking soda to cook, freshen up your refrigerator and brighten your smile, but a study published in the journal Cell says this cheap, simple substance may help chemotherapy attack cancer. Chemotherapy works by destroying actively growing cells, but tumors often cut off the oxygen supply of cells inside of them. This causes the cells to shut down, making it difficult for chemotherapy to work. Scientists at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Moffitt Cancer Center looked at breast and colon cancers in mice and saw an increase in cell activity after giving the mice water mixed with baking soda, also known as bicarbonate soda."

A review of research on this topic found that deep squats don’t contribute any pain or damage to the knee joint compared with half and quarter squats.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ This is because the knee displaces the additional tension incurred during a deep squat, ensuring that the weight is balanced throughout the knee and surrounding tissue. Moreover, this review showed that squats can actually be beneficial for knees. When attempted properly, deep squats strengthen the knees."

Evidence:"The currently available ones inhibit l-type channels in humans and seem to have a neutral effect on erectile function (47). Possibly this is because this channel is linked with nNOS activation from cholinergic nerve endings into the penis, which is important for NO release and consequently erection. However, although this channel is inhibited, nNOS from nitrergic nerves will be activated, allowing the erectile process to begin. Another class of antihypertensive drugs is the ACE inhibitors. They act by mimicking the structure of the ACE substrate, directly blocking Ang II formation and at the same time increasing bradykinin levels. The net results are reduced vasoconstriction, decreased sodium and water retention, and increased vasodilation through bradykinin.As a future antihypertensive treatment, there is theoretical evidence that gene therapy may produce long-lasting antihypertensive effects by influencing the genes associated with hypertension."

Evidence:"Some groups demonstrated that preconditioning with morphine alleviated cerebral ischemia injury through activating the mTOR pathway (Arabian et al., 2018b) or mitochondrial KATP channels (Arabian et al., 2018a). However, repeated use of morphine will lead to various side-effects, such as antinociceptive tolerance, dependence, and addiction.Morphine AddictionLong-term treatment with morphine for the management of chronic pain will result in tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine. In order to overcome tolerance, a higher dose of morphine is often required for the maintenance of analgesia, which will result in the development of severe side-effects, including respiratory depression, withdrawal symptoms, and rewarding effects with a high risk of relapse (Eidson and Murphy, 2019). Morphine addiction has become a major public health issue. An increasing number of studies have revealed that several brain regions, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hippocampus (Hipp), are involved in morphine addiction (Kim et al., 2016). Although mechanisms underlying morphine-mediated processes remain the subject of much debate, morphine stimulation activates G protein-coupled opioid receptors and then induces significant molecular changes inside the cell, such as an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and activation of potassium channels (Qu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019)."

Evidence:"Fruit juice, different from SSBs, has been considered a healthier drink. However, to date, the findings of the association between fruit juice intake and risk of type 2 diabetes are mixed according to type of fruit juice [5]–[11]. Several prospective studies suggested that higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes [5], [10], while others showed no significant association for 100% fruit juice [6], [8], [9].To our knowledge, no meta-analysis has been published to accurately estimate the strength of the effects of type of fruit juice (sugar-sweetened or 100%) on incidence of type 2 diabetes. Although all four studies included in this meta-analysis showed no significant association between 100% fruit juice and risk of developing type 2 diabetes, there was a positive trend for three [6], [8] of the four studies, and insufficient power may explain the non-significant study findings. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this issue.Materials and MethodsLiterature and search strategyThe PRISMA checklist is available as Checklist S1.

Evidence:"Now plank exercises, in which you assume a position and hold it, are the gold standard for working your core, while classic sit-ups and crunches have fallen out of favor. Why the shift? One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back - they push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort. Second, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles. Finally, activities of daily living, as well as sports and recreational activities, call on your muscles to work together, not in isolation."

The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since its discovery in 1983. Its origin in wild primates-the apes and monkeys-has long been accepted, but the question remained-which ones, and how could it have been transmitted? The first question is answered by a report in Nature: Beatrice H. Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and colleagues [from the USA, France and the UK] provide the most persuasive evidence yet that HIV-1 entered the human population from the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, our nearest living relative.From their analysis, it is now almost certain that HIV-1 entered the human population from chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which lives in equatorial west Africa, in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, where the HIV-1 virus is thought, on other evidence, to have emerged in humans.Chimpanzees, like many other primates, harbour simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). These closely resemble HIV but appear to co-exist far more successfully with their animal hosts, pointing to an ancient association between virus and host."

Evidence:"You may have heard from a friend that nursing can serve as a form of birth control — and while that’s not entirely untrue, it’s not the whole story either.Can you get pregnant while you’re breastfeeding?The simple answer is yes. Although breastfeeding offers some protection from ovulation, the monthly occurrence where you release a mature egg from one of your ovaries, it is possible to ovulate and become pregnant prior to getting your first period.The key players here are the hormones oxytocin and prolactin, which are responsible for milk production and the let-down reflex. Increased levels of these hormones actually suppress the brain from making the main hormone that stimulates the ovary to grow an egg each month. When a mother is breastfeeding exclusively, or even on a consistent basis, it is less likely that she is going to ovulate at all until she starts to wean.That doesn’t mean that you won’t ovulate or conceive. The "protective" effect of breastfeeding becomes progressively less effective the longer it's been since you delivered your baby. Can you get pregnant if you’re breastfeeding and haven’t gotten your period yet?Since ovulation comes before menstruation in your monthly cycle, the absence of your period does not eliminate the chance that you could be ovulating at any given point."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"But findings have been inconsistent. Overall, experts have found little to no benefit from vitamin C for preventing or treating the common cold. In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shortened cold duration -- by 8% in adults and by 14% in children.In 2010, researchers looked at all studies and found that taking vitamin C every day did not prevent the number of colds that a person got. In some cases, it made symptoms improve.The results were different for people who were in very good physical condition, such as marathon runners."

Evidence:"They include deli meats, bacon and hot dogs. BY Danielle Underferth
Processed meats are convenient, affordable and woven into our collective diet. For many, a turkey sandwich is a lunchtime fixture, bacon is a prized breakfast treat and cookouts wouldn't be the same without hotdogs on the grill
Unfortunately, when these processed meats are preserved, cancer-causing substances form. “Research shows that eating processed meats like bacon and cold cuts can increase your chances for stomach and colorectal cancer,” says Lindsey Wohlford, employee wellness dietitian at MD Anderson Cancer Center. So how much is too much?"

Evidence:"Scientists don’t know yet the exact mechanism that makes oil pulling work, they just know that it does. Research has shown that oil pulling reduces the number of cavity-causing bacteria. Further research has also shown that coconut oil is the best acting oil but that sesame is also a very good oil for oil pulling. So if you want to decide which oil to use for oil pulling consider using either sesame or coconut and then go with whichever you prefer. One way in which oil-pulling may work is in the reduction of the acidity in the mouth."

A person should gradually increase dietary fiber intake to reduce the risk of side effects, such as gas and bloating. People should talk with a doctor about severe or very large hemorrhoids or those that do not improve with at-home care and dietary changes after a week or two.

Evidence:"Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health — smoking harms nearly every organ in your body, including your heart. Nearly one-third of deaths from heart disease are the result of smoking and secondhand smoke. You might be tempted to turn to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, vape pens, and other nondisposable and disposable vaping devices) as a way to ease the transition from traditional cigarettes to not smoking at all. But is smoking e-cigarettes (also called vaping) better for you than using tobacco products? Can e-cigarettes help you to stop smoking once and for all? Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, shares health information about vaping."

Evidence:"The larger the banana, the more carbs you’ll consume and the greater the rise in your blood sugar will be.Are bananas safe for those with diabetes?Most general dietary guidelines for diabetes recommend following a healthy, balanced diet that includes fruit (22, 23, 24).This is because eating fruits and vegetables has been linked to better health and a lower risk of conditions such as heart disease and some cancers (25, 26, 27, 28). People living with diabetes are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (29, 30, 31, 32). Unlike refined sugar products such as candy and cake, the carbs in fruits like bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (33).For most people with diabetes, fruits — including bananas — are a healthy choice.However, some people who are following low carb diets need to watch their total carbohydrate intake to stay within their daily carb allotment. This means foods higher in carbs, including bananas, have to be limited on low carb diets.If your doctor says you can eat bananas, it’s important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of a banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.SummaryFruits like bananas are healthy foods that contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals. You can include bananas in your diet even if you have diabetes."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A more recent study randomly assigned 39 study subjects to follow a restricted calorie diet with apple cider vinegar or a restricted calorie diet without apple cider vinegar for 12 weeks. While both groups lost weight, the apple cider vinegar group lost more. As with many prior studies, this one was quite small and short-term. In all, the scientific evidence that vinegar consumption (whether of the apple cider variety or not) is a reliable, long-term means of losing excess weight is not compelling. (On the other hand, a number of studies suggest that vinegar might prevent spikes in blood sugar in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes by blocking starch absorption — perhaps that’s a topic for another day.) Even among proponents of apple cider vinegar for weight loss or other health benefits, it’s unclear when to drink apple cider vinegar (for example, whether there is particular time of day that might be best?)"

Common uses for nauseaStudies show that ginger may prevent and treat nausea and vomiting caused by various conditions (7, 14, 15). Here are some of the best-studied uses for the root in managing nausea.PregnancyAn estimated 80% of women experience nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. As such, most research on this application for ginger has been conducted in the first and second trimester (2). Ginger has been found to be more effective than a placebo at reducing morning sickness during pregnancy for many women (2)."
