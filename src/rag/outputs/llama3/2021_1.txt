And then we reply, “none of them”, because braces don’t really help for Achilles tendonitis. This article explains why braces aren’t very useful and suggests another simple thing you can do to help alleviate your Achilles pain. Remember, if you need more help with an Achilles injury, you're welcome to consult one of our team via video call. The terms tendinitis, tendonitis, tendinosis, and tendinopathy mean the same thing for all practical purposes, and we use these interchangeably in our articles.In this article:Achilles tendon anatomy Why a brace for Achilles tendonitis is not useful What you can use instead of a brace for Achilles tendon pain How we can help We've also made a video about this:Achilles tendon anatomyTo understand the effect, or lack thereof, of a brace for Achilles tendonitis, it helps to have a quick overview of the anatomy of the Achilles tendon.As you can see in the picture above, the calf muscles come down the back of the ankle, and the Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel bone.The two foot movements that affect your Achilles tendon are dorsiflexion, when your foot moves upwards, towards your shin, such as when you’re squatting, and plantar flexion, when your foot moves downwards, such as when you go up onto your toes."

Evidence:"Folate has been found to protect against some cancers, prevent heart disorders and stroke, build muscle mass, form hemoglobin, and reduce the impact of mental and emotional disorders, says Improve Memory. Perhaps most interestingly, folic acid is also thought to slow down age-related memory and cognitive decline.Folate (vitamin B-9) is vital for red blood cell formation as well as for healthy cell function and growth, points out the Mayo Clinic. You can get folic acid through a multivitamin or by eating dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans, and peas, as well as fruits such as lemons, oranges, bananas, strawberries, and melons. While studies are still being done, preliminary research suggests that dementia and Alzheimer’s disease could be linked to low folate levels and high homocysteine levels.Low folate and high homocysteine concentrations have been associated with poor cognitive performance. One study showed high doses of folic acid administered to healthy people between 50 and 75 resulted in memory test scores similar to those five years younger, with cognitive speed scores similar to those two years younger. Researchers say this represents a significant level of brain protection due in part to the presence of folate.Facts About FolateFolic acid, a B vitamin used by the body to manufacture DNA, is necessary for rapid cell division and organ and tissue formation in developing babies.The recommended daily intake of folate for adults is 400 micrograms.Folic acid-rich foods include fortified breakfast cereals, bread, rice, pasta, orange juice; green vegetables, and legumes such as kidney, navy, lentil and garbanzo beans.Folic acid intake is thought to lower risks related to stroke, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer.Folate-deficiency anemia, the lack of folic acid in the blood, results in low levels of folate."

Burns can be very painful and may cause:red or peeling skinblistersswellingwhite or charred skinThe amount of pain you feel is not always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless. Treating burns and scalds
To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below:immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burningremove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies, but do not move anything that's stuck to the skincool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 to 30 minutes – do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like buttermake sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt areaafter cooling the burn, cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it – a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your handuse painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any painraise the affected area if possible – this helps to reduce swellingif it's an acid or chemical burn, dial 999, carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possibleRead more about treating burns and scalds. When to get medical attention
Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.More serious burns require professional medical attention.You should go to a hospital A&E department for:all chemical and electrical burnslarge or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's handburns that cause white or charred skin – any sizeburns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitalsIf someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention.Some symptoms may be delayed and can include:coughinga sore throatdifficulty breathingfacial burnsPeople at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald.The size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended.Read more about:recovering from burns and scaldscomplications of burns and scalds
Types of burn
Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected.Your skin has 3 layers:the epidermis – the outer layer of skinthe dermis – the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair folliclesthe subcutaneous fat, or subcutis – the deeper layer of fat and tissueThere are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:superficial epidermal burn – where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blisteredsuperficial dermal burn – where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blistersdeep dermal or partial thickness burn – where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painlessfull thickness burn – where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy."

Evidence:"In this whole process, folic acid works in tandem with vitamin B12 as a methyl group donor. This is why it is always recommended to take these two vitamins together in order to treat vitiligo. According to some scientific studies, a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation and sun exposure is a good strategy to regain natural skin color. Supplementation of B12 and folic acid along with pantothenic acid, a water soluble form of B vitamins, has also shown very promising outcome in removing white patches. Vitamin A, C, and E

Evidence:"A review of 15 studies published in April 2016 in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews looked at the effect of yoga in patients with asthma, finding that yoga “probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.”“There can be outside forces, such as allergens and toxins, that may trigger an asthma attack,” says Bar. “While we can’t always necessarily avoid some triggers, we can use yoga to try to generally stay calm and have breath and body awareness, and that may be able to at least take a layer off the severity of the attack, if not help prevent it.”Doing yoga routinely can have a cumulative effect, says Bar. If you begin to feel an asthma attack coming on, you can use breath awareness, says Bar, to slow down and remain calm. During an asthma attack, Bar adds, we use any muscles we can to try to breathe, and as a result, our muscles get very tight; stretching the shoulders, back, side, and breathing muscles routinely is great conditioning for getting those muscles in the habit of relaxing in the event of an asthma attack. “You can do a relaxation pose every day and do one or two of the body stretches daily,” says Bar. “It won’t take very long.” And best of all, there are secondary benefits of yoga, such as a feeling of peace, increased mobility, better flexibility, and improved balance, says Bar.Simply put, yoga may help provide some asthma relief, and can lead to a host of other health benefits."

Maxims typically date back many years, but “feed a cold, starve a fever” may beat them all. This saying has been traced to a 1574 dictionary by John Withals, which noted that “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief is that eating food may help the body generate warmth during a “cold” and that avoiding food may help it cool down when overheated. But recent medical science says the old saw is wrong. It should be “feed a cold, feed a fever.”
Let’s take colds first."

Evidence:"In studies on the relationship between selenium and cancer prevention, data suggest it may help prevent gastrointestinal (16) (36) and lung (17) cancers, although findings from bladder cancer research are conflicting (26) (38) (44). Other studies on whether selenium status impacts cancer risk are also mixed (51) (52) (53), and a review of RCTs did not find clear evidence of cancer preventive potential (29). In addition, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) failed to find protective effects against prostate cancer (8) (21) or colorectal adenomas (45). In other studies, selenium along with soy and vitamin E did not prevent prostate cancer progression (27), and selenium taken with lycopene did not modulate prostate cancer risk (46). Moreover, selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer (22), and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality (37).

Oral contraceptives have long been known to be highly effective at suppressing the development of ovarian cysts. In one study, the relative risk of developing ovarian cysts was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.39) for women taking an oral contraceptive compared with those not taking an oral contraceptive.1 Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts, the authors sought to clarify whether this is appropriate. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Although the studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analyses for most questions, results from these studies were consistent enough to draw several conclusions. Five trials looked at spontaneously occurring ovarian cysts, representing a combined total of 398 women. The largest study included 141 women, and four of the studies were conducted in Turkey."

While taking evening primrose oil for eczema may not hurt, it most likely will not help. “There is some suggestion that topically applied [evening primrose oil] may have some beneficial effect on eczema, but the evidence was not very robust,” said Dr. Lio. “This suggests that it may only work on a subset of patients and/or the actual clinical effect may be very minimal.”
Instead, Dr. Lio recommends looking into other supplements that are more effective in treating eczema symptoms, such as hemp seed oil. In one study, participants who took hempseed as an oral supplement showed improvement in their atopic dermatitis symptoms."

Evidence:"Slowly rebuild after an ankle fracture
If the ankle is broken, the joint shouldn’t bear any weight or strain for at least 6 weeks so the fracture can heal. As a result, the stabilising muscles weaken and are much less effective when it comes to rehab. Proper movement and exercise with a therapist in these 6 weeks is crucial to the long term recovery of the cartilage and ligaments. Using supports and ankle braces in the rehab and recovery period is the best practice for long-term health of the joint. Supports and orthoses provide stability and stimulation
A brace provides support after the initial 6 week rest period.It ensures that the ankle joint receives the necessary stability after a fracture and is not overloaded. These products are designed and shaped so that they can be worn comfortably day to day, in most footwear including joggers, sports shoes and business shoes."

Evidence:"In total, 90% reported either an allergic reaction or that the vitamin did not affect their scarring.However, the vitamin may benefit other skin conditions. For example, one 2015 study suggested that vitamin E may improve symptoms and quality of life for people with atopic dermatitis, or eczema.A 2016 review says that more research is required to investigate whether there is any value in using vitamin E to manage scar healing. At present, there is not enough evidence to recommend using vitamin E to diminish scars.Learn about which home remedies might help treat scars.Using vitamin E for scarsBased on the available evidence, it would seem that vitamin E does not reduce the appearance of scarring.However, moisturizing the skin can help prevent scars from forming during wound healing, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). As long as a person is not allergic to vitamin E, they can use a moisturizer that contains this ingredient. However, it is unclear if moisturizers containing vitamin E would offer special benefits.Anyone interested in using topical vitamin E oil or taking vitamin E supplements should speak to a healthcare provider before trying.Learn more about vitamin E oil here.Effective techniques for scar healingThere are other ways to reduce the appearance of scars that may be more effective than vitamin E. These include:Silicone sheetsHydrogel or silicone gel sheets are soft, flexible, self-adhesive dressings that a person can apply over scars to flatten and soften them.Silicone may hydrate the scar tissue and reduce the production of collagen fibers. This means that scars may develop flatter, softer, and paler than they would otherwise.The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom suggest using silicone sheets for 12 hours a day for at least 3 months.Learn more about scar tissue here.MassageScar massage is one of the most common treatments for scar management."

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun.

People with arthritis who practice yoga regularly will eventually see improved physical function. “Yoga can enhance pain management, thereby improving function,” Dr. Kolasinski says. Improve flexibility
Yoga can also benefit people with stiff joints due to arthritis. Stretching exercises in general help improve range of motion, so the fact that you’re stretching in yoga will help flexibility. Stay active
On days when you’re experiencing a painful arthritis flare, continuing to do some type of physical activity like yoga, if possible, can help you maintain joint flexibility. Create a mind-body connection
Yoga’s emphasis on introspective thought – pinpointing the sources of pain or anxiety and learning to relax them – is useful for people with arthritis."

Evidence:"What should you do?The rumor mill might have you believing that dabbing some regular old toothpaste on your zit will help it clear up overnight. But, while it’s true that several ingredients found in toothpaste are drying to skin and might help shrink your pimple, this home remedy for breakouts isn’t worth the risk.Plus, there are several easily available treatments you can try instead. Keep reading to learn why toothpaste doesn’t belong on your skin.Toothpaste on pimples may  do more harm than goodAlthough it’s not clear exactly how and where this trend got started, some likely reasons are:Many toothpaste formulas once contained a chemical called triclosan that could work to kill the bacteria that causes and worsens breakouts.Some ingredients commonly found in toothpaste, such as baking soda, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide, are known to be drying, which could help shrink a zit.According to Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse, a board-certified dermatologist, the menthol in toothpaste can create a tingly feeling that may temporarily reduce pain and swelling.So, it’s not totally out of left field to believe this home remedy could work. But there are several reasons why you shouldn’t use toothpaste as your go-to acne treatment.Outdated informationFirst of all, most companies no longer use triclosan in their toothpaste formulas. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, some testing suggests that triclosan could negatively affect thyroid hormones. So even if you do find a toothpaste that still contains this chemical, using it on pimples may not be worth the risk.Toothpaste can be irritating to your skinRemember, toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not the sensitive surface of your face."

Evidence:"The document also focuses specifically on their effects on hypertriglyceridemia, rather than atherosclerotic vascular disease. To TCTMD, Skulas-Ray stressed that the degree of treatment response to omega-3 prescriptions is determined by the severity of an individual’s triglyceride levels prior to treatment. She also noted that levels are highly variable day-to-day, so the determination of response shouldn’t be based on a single triglyceride measurement. For managing hypertriglyceridemia (200-499 mg/dL), the AHA experts state that prescription-strength omega-3 fatty acids, either with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or EPA plus docosapentaenoic acid (DHA), would be expected to yield a 20% to 30% reduction in triglycerides without any increase in LDL cholesterol. For individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia, 4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce triglycerides by more than 30%, but LDL cholesterol may increase in agents that contain DHA. The goal for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce decrease triglycerides to less than 500 mg/dL and decrease the risk of pancreatitis."

Evidence:"By Mary Margaret Chappell and Jennifer Davis
Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City."

L-theanine benefits and usesMost known for helping people relax, L-theanine has other potential health benefits, including:Anxiety and stress reliefSipping on a hot cup of tea can help you feel at ease, and research suggests that it not only relaxes the mind, but it also does so without causing drowsiness (1).In a review of five randomized controlled trials that included 104 participants, four trials linked L-theanine with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations (2).Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry focused on people living with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers found that L-theanine decreased anxiety and improved symptoms (3). Increased focusPaired with caffeine, L-theanine may help increase focus and attention.A small study found that a combination of L-theanine (97 milligrams, or mg) and caffeine (40 mg) helped a group of young adults focus better during demanding tasks. A typical cup of coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine (4, 5).The study’s participants also felt more alert and less tired in general. Better immunitySome research suggests that L-theanine may improve the function of the body’s immune system."

Evidence:"Steam inhalation doesn’t actually kill the virus responsible for the infection. At best, steam inhalation might make you feel a little better as your body fights your cold. One review of six clinical trials evaluating steam therapy in adults with the common cold had mixed results. Some participants had symptom relief, but others didn’t. Additionally, some participants experienced discomfort inside the nose from the steam inhalation.Another recent clinical trial looked at the use of steam inhalation in treating chronic sinus symptoms. The study, however, didn’t find that steam inhalation was beneficial for the majority of sinus symptoms, except for headache."

Evidence:"Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety. The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better. How does exercise help depression and anxiety? Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:
Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety
Regular exercise has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you:
Gain confidence."

Evidence:"These ingredients aren’t designed to kill lice and their eggs (called nits) like prescription and OTC formulas. But many people are using mayonnaise in an effort to find a safe, more natural lice remedy.To effectively get rid of lice, you need to get rid of both the parasites and the nits. The theory behind mayonnaise is that it will help “suffocate” the lice so that they die off. However, there’s no solid proof that this method works. If anything, you might see reduced activity in your scalp temporarily, but the lice will likely come back. Another drawback to using mayonnaise for lice is that it won’t catch and suffocate all the parasites as effectively as other methods."
Question:Can applying mayonnaise help get rid of lice?

No

Evidence:"Researchers attribute date’s iron-boosting properties to its iron content, as well as to the fact that it contains multiple nutrients that enhance iron absorption and hemoglobin production.To give you a better idea of how dates can improve both iron and hemoglobin levels, here’s a quick overview of some of those studies.1. Dates Improve Iron Deficiency Anemia in Girls Aged Aged 8 to 10A study published in the journal Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics showed that adding dates to the diets of young, iron-deficient girls, improves iron and hemoglobin levels (source).Here’s a summary of what the study entailed, as well as the results:At the start of this study, the mean hematocrit (Hct) was 34.24 g/dL, the mean ferritin (standard measure for iron) was 47.07 μg/dL and the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.19 g/dL.The participants consumed Mazafati dates for 2 months. No other dietary changes were made.After 2 months the girls showed improvements in all categories: mean hematocrit (Hct) was 37.17 g/dL, mean ferritin was 53.98 μg/dL and mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 12.05 g/dL.Dates contain vitamin A, which helps with the synthesis of hemoglobin. Interestingly, some studies and experts state that vitamin A deficiency tends to go along with anemia. And low vitamin A can decrease iron absorption, further contributing to the development of anemia. Furthermore, another report indicates that taking vitamin A and iron together seems to be more effective at preventing iron deficiency, versus taking them individually (1, 2, 3).Vitamin C is also found in dates and it’s known to enhance iron absorption.From a scientific perspective, the results of this study were considered statistically significant.2."
Question:Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?

Yes

Evidence:"Some people who used zinc nasal sprays had permanent loss of smell. Taken all together, research shows mixed results for zinc and colds. For that reason, zinc can't be recommended to shorten your cold symptoms. Researchers can't say why zinc works in some studies and not others. There are still questions about which type of zinc works best. Research also doesn't show what amount of zinc is the best."
Question:Can zinc help treat the common cold?

No

Evidence:"Magnet therapy or wearing copper jewelry may seem attractive for easing your arthritis pain simply and inexpensively. But studies confirm these treatments are ineffective for arthritis pain. According to studies published over the years, magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets don’t work on arthritis pain or stiffness. Placebo-controlled trials have been done in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A few small studies showed that magnets may offer some pain benefit in osteoarthritis, but these results have not been replicated or expanded to larger trials. “In my research I set out to confuse the heck out of participants so they couldn't tell which device was real and which was a placebo,” says one researcher, Stewart Richmond, PhD, research fellow at the University of York, in England."

Author disclosure: No relevant financial affiliations. BenefitsHarms1 in 9 did not develop antibiotic-associated diarrheaNone1 in 6 did not develop antibiotic-associated diarrhea when receiving high-dose probiotics (especially those containing Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus)
Details for This Review
Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings
Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea
Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)
Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 
Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 
The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment."

Evidence:"In people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, Tylenol provides marginal improvements in pain (immediately/short-term) and physical function (short-term), but not likely to a degree that makes a meaningful impact. Overall, Tylenol does not increase the risk of negative side effects. Other potentially effective treatment options for osteoarthritis include: nonâsteroidal antiâinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exercise, acupuncture, and surgery. Start a discussion with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of different treatment options for knee and hip osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen, paracetamol, Tylenol... The use of these terms interchangeably can leave us getting Shakespearean and asking, what’s in a name?"
Question:Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?

Yes

Addiction,   Behavioral Health,   Mental HealthHow Music Helps to Heal Depression, TraumaApril 15, 2022  | Kate Carey-Trull 
This Story’s Health Experts
								Harold (Hank) Schwartz, MD							
								Javeed Sukhera, MD, PhD, FRCPC							
Music can relax you, bring back memories of certain times in your life or bring a smile to your face. Research shows a clear link between health and music: music therapy can be used to help combat depression and heal trauma, and listening to music has been shown to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease stress levels. Before the Hartford Symphony Orchestra concert Friday evening, Javeed Sukhera, MD, PhD, chair of psychiatry, Institute of Living, spoke about the history of the IOL and how music can be used for healing. The conversation with HSO Music Director Carolyn Kuan included a candid discussion about depression. The concerts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by the IOL, featured the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, legendary artists who endured lifelong struggles with depression."

Evidence:"This belief may stem from studies linking soy-rich diets to a lower risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease in adults (6, 7, 8, 9).However, there’s currently insufficient evidence demonstrating that soy formula use in infancy reduces a baby’s risk of developing these diseases later in life (1, 2, 3).Similarly, there’s no strong evidence that soy formula reduces digestive issues like colic or offers any additional protection against allergies. Therefore, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (3, 10). On the other hand, experts agree that soy formula is the most appropriate choice for full-term babies with galactosemia or hereditary lactase deficiency — two medical conditions that prevent babies from breaking down the natural sugars in cow’s milk (1, 2). Soy formula is also the most appropriate choice for vegan families. Although the vitamin D3 in most soy formulas is currently sourced from sheep lanolin, they’re the closest available option to fully vegan baby formula.summaryMany believe that soy formula use in infancy reduces colic, allergies, and the risk of disease later in life, but more research is needed to confirm this. Soy formula is the best feeding choice for vegan families and babies with specific medical conditions.Are soy isoflavones harmful to babies?Soy formulas are naturally rich in isoflavones –– a plant compound with a structure similar to that of the hormone estrogen."
Question:Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?

Evidence:"Walking at a comfortable pace — whether it’s indoors or outdoors — is an excellent low-impact exercise.Stationary bikeUsing a stationary bike on an easy setting allows you to slowly build your strength. Using the bike in your home allows you to avoid traffic and stop when you feel strained.Water exercises Freestyle swimming provides a moderate workout. Walking in water up to your waist lightens the load on your joints while also providing enough resistance for your muscles to become stronger. This can greatly improve pain and daily function of the hips. YogaRegular yoga can help improve flexibility of the joints, strengthen muscles, and lessen pain. Some yoga positions can add strain to your hips, so if you feel discomfort, ask your instructor for modifications."

Evidence:"Antioxidant supplements are commercially available to help treat male infertility, but research on its effects on semen quality and rates of pregnancy and live birth are limited. The new study reports on results from the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility Trial (MOXI), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted at nine sites across the United States. The study enrolled 171 couples where the male partner had at least one abnormal reading on an analysis evaluating sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality; the female partners had normal fertility test results. Men received a placebo or an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins C, E and D, selenium, l-carnitine, zinc, folic acid and lycopene for at least three months and up to six months. MOXI was supported by NICHD’s Reproductive Medicine Network. The study team found no statistically significant differences in sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality between the placebo and antioxidant groups after three months."
