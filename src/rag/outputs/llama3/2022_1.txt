Evidence:"You might wonder: what do tea bags have to do with pulled teeth?Why the tea bag? Tea bags are a natural way to stop bleeding after dental surgery. This is why they work:Black tea is full of tannins, which are hemostatic (i.e. they cause blood to coagulate, which in turn makes the bleeding stop).Tannins are also astringent. An astringent is something that causes body tissues, including blood vessels, to shrink or constrict."

Evidence:"Collagen hydrolysate supplements are rich in a number of amino acids (a group of chemical compounds) that play an important role in the creation of collagen. Type II collagen is one of the main proteins in cartilage. It’s been suggested that taking collagen hydrolysate can improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis by stimulating your body’s production of joint collagen. Some studies have suggested that autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by taking a foreign antigen (a substance that causes your immune system to react to it) by mouth, which could dampen down your immune system’s reaction. Taking collagen by mouth may introduce some chemicals that cause joint inflammation into your body and create oral tolerance to these antigens, reducing the effects of inflammatory arthritis."

Evidence:"Scientific Consensus on Cell Phone Safety
Scientific studies: The FDA’s physicians, scientists, and engineers regularly analyze scientific studies and publications for evidence of health effects of exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phones. The weight of nearly 30 years of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from use of cell phones to health problems, such as cancer. Public health data: The FDA also monitors and analyzes public health data on cancer rates in the U.S. population. The data clearly demonstrate no widespread rise in brain and other nervous system cancers in the last 30 years despite the enormous increase in cell phone use during this period. In fact, the rate of brain and other nervous system cancers diagnosed in United States has decreased for the last 15 years or so.

Evidence:"The findings are complicated.There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer. It’s important to remember that cancer grows quite well in healthy tissue with normal pH levels. Additionally, naturally acidic environments, like the stomach, don’t encourage cancer growth.Once cancer cells begin to grow, they produce an acidic environment that encourages malignant growth. The goal of many researchers is to decrease the acidity of that environment so that the cancer cells aren’t able to thrive.A 2009 study published in Cancer Research found that injecting bicarbonate into mice reduced tumor pH levels and slowed the progression of metastatic breast cancer.The acidic microenvironment of tumors may be related to chemotherapeutic failure in cancer treatment. Cancer cells are difficult to target because the area around them is acidic, though they’re alkaline. Many cancer drugs have trouble passing through these layers.Several studies have evaluated the use of antacid drugs in combination with chemotherapy.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed for the treatment of acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)."

Evidence:"All rights reserved.100 Percent Fruit Juice Does Not Affect Blood Sugar LevelsFebruary 6, 2018Mark L. FuerstJuice is good food and does not contribute to disruption of glucose-insulin homeostasis, as long as its 100% real fruit juice, according to a new study.A comprehensive data analysis suggests that 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, or insulin resistance, according to a new study.The findings are consistent with previous research indicating that 100% fruit juice is not associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and support a growing body of evidence that 100% fruit juice has no significant effect on glycemic control.Juice is good foodPure, 100% fruit juices can be nutrient-dense foods providing potassium, magnesium, folate, calcium, vitamins A and C, and soluble fiber, as well as an array of bioactive substances, including carotenoids and flavonoids. “Nutritional guidance encourages consumption of fruit as part of a balanced and healthy diet, although guidance often recommends limited consumption of fruit in the form of juice citing concerns over a lack of fiber and the potential for excessive energy intake. Juices also tend to have moderately high-glycemic index ratings, indicating a relatively rapid and high post-prandial glucose response as compared with foods with a lower glycemic index,” stated the researchers, led by Mary M. Murphy of the Center for Chemical Regulation & Food Safety in Washington, DC.Diets lower in these types of simple carbohydrates may be relevant for the prevention and management of some chronic diseases, including type 2 DM.The researchers published their results online December 15, 2017 in Journal of Nutritional Science.A systematic review quantitatively summarized results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of 100% fruit juice on glucose–insulin homeostasis. Using data from 18 RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (16 studies), fasting blood insulin (11 studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 7 studies) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; 3 studies) between the 100% fruit juice intervention and control groups.The results show 100% fruit juice, as compared with the control group,  had no significant effect on:Fasting blood glucose (−0.13 mmol/L)Fasting blood insulin (−0.24 pmol/L)HOMA-IR (−0.22) or HbA1c (−0.001)Results from stratified analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100% fruit juice and the measures of glucose control.“The available RCT indicate that repeated intake of 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on glycemic control or measures of insulin resistance,” the researchers stated."

Evidence:"Magnet therapy or wearing copper jewelry may seem attractive for easing your arthritis pain simply and inexpensively. But studies confirm these treatments are ineffective for arthritis pain. According to studies published over the years, magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets don’t work on arthritis pain or stiffness. Placebo-controlled trials have been done in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A few small studies showed that magnets may offer some pain benefit in osteoarthritis, but these results have not been replicated or expanded to larger trials. “In my research I set out to confuse the heck out of participants so they couldn't tell which device was real and which was a placebo,” says one researcher, Stewart Richmond, PhD, research fellow at the University of York, in England."

Evidence:"The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness."

Research Report
Cannabis (Marijuana) Research Report
Is marijuana addictive? Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. Recent data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of marijuana use disorder.18 People who begin using marijuana before the age of 18 are four to seven times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder than adults.19
Marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence—in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. People who use marijuana frequently often report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness, and/or various forms of physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to 2 weeks.20,21 Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.22,23
Marijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the person cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted. Those studies suggest that 9% of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it,24,25 rising to about 17% in those who start using in their teens.26,27
In 2015, about 4.0 million people in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder;3 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment for their marijuana use.28

Marijuana potency, as detected in confiscated samples, has steadily increased over the past few decades."

      The vegan diet
A vegan diet is based on plants (such as vegetables, grains, nuts and fruits) and foods made from plants.Vegans do not eat foods that come from animals, including dairy products and eggs. Healthy eating as a vegan
You can get the nutrients you need from eating a varied and balanced vegan diet including fortified foods and supplements. For a healthy vegan diet:eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every daybase meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates (choose wholegrain where possible)have some fortified dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options)eat some beans, pulses and other proteinseat nuts and seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids (such as walnuts) every daychoose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat in small amountshave fortified foods or supplements containing nutrients that are more difficult to get through a vegan diet, including vitamin D, vitamin B12, iodine, selenium, calcium and irondrink plenty of fluids (the government recommends 6 to 8 cups or glasses a day)If you choose to include foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar, have them less often and in small amounts.See The Eatwell Guide for more information about a healthy diet. The Eatwell Guide applies to vegetarians, vegans, people of all ethnic origins and those who are a healthy weight for their height, as well as those who are overweight.The only group The Eatwell Guide is not suitable for is children under the age of 2, as they have different needs. Getting the right nutrients from a vegan diet
With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.If you do not plan your diet properly, you could miss out on essential nutrients, such as calcium, iron, vitamin B12, iodine and selenium. Vegans who are pregnant or breastfeeding
During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, if you follow a vegan diet you'll need to make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals for your child to develop healthily.Find out more about a vegetarian and vegan diet while pregnant.If you're bringing up your baby or child on a vegan diet, you need to ensure they get a wide variety of foods to provide the energy and vitamins they need for growth."

Once more, the use of illegal skin lightening creams highlights the dangers of Hydroquinone
 by Simon | 0 comments
A recent study conducted by researchers working at the Medicines and Consumer Safety division of the Scientific Institute of Public Health and the Department of Toxicology and The Dermato-Cosmetology and Centre for Pharmaceutical Research in Brussels, Belgium, entitled “In vitro Dermal Absorption of Hydroquinone: Protocol Validation and Applicability on Illegal Skin-Whitening Cosmetics”, which was published in the Journal of Skin Pharmacology and Physiology in 2016, has highlighted the serious dangers of hydroquinone penetrating the blood stream by skin absorption with a cumulative toxic effect with daily applications. Hydroquinone is classified as a drug and is banned for the use in cosmetic products in Europe and in many countries such as Japan, Australia and several African states. Nevertheless, it is still too often found in formulations of depigmenting creams sold online all over the world. The main reason being, that sale of such creams represents a multi-billion dollar market. Sadly although HQ does depigment the skin, this ingredient poses a serious public health risk. Hydroquinone (HQ) is a substance which is naturally present in plants and foods such as coffee, cranberries, and blueberries for example, and which isn’t dangerous to consume when ingested occasionally and in small quantities with the foods we eat."

Evidence:"However, you may wonder about the origin of this idea and whether it’s supported by science.This article tells you whether carrots benefit your eyes and provides other tips to keep your vision healthy.Share on Pinterest Carrots and eye healthIt has long been believed that eating carrots promotes eye health and improves your eyesight, especially at night. Though there is truth to this, the association between carrots and eyesight originated from a myth. During World War II, British Royal Air Force pilots first began using radar to target and shoot down enemy planes. In an effort to keep this new technology a secret, the visual accuracy of the pilots — especially at night — was attributed to eating carrots. This led to a longstanding propaganda campaign that promoted carrots for better eyesight. This embellished link between eating carrots and improved night vision remains today.However, although they’re not quite the magic eye food they were marketed to be during World War II, carrots do contain certain compounds that are good for your eyes."

Evidence:"There are several theories why chewing gum may support weight loss, but research doesn’t show strong results.One often-quoted study found that chewing gum may burn about 11 calories an hour. This could be compared to the small extra daily calorie burn found in people who tap their toes or otherwise “fidget” all day, and it is unlikely to produce weight loss. Others propose that the act of chewing may lead to changes in digestive hormones that decrease hunger, thus making it easier to cut calories for weight loss. This makes sense in theory, but short-term controlled trials haven’t shown the expected hormonal change.Chewing gum may aid weight loss by replacing overeating for some. Participants in one controlled study showed a ten percent drop in mid-afternoon snacking when they chewed gum 15 minutes each hour after lunch. But, in a controlled trial that followed overweight people for eight weeks, those who chewed gum 90 minutes a day did not lose weight any more successfully than those who didn’t chew gum.Consider other strategies to avoid extra eating."

Evidence:"HIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study Finds
Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuScienceNewsHIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study FindsResearchers have found new clues to the deadly disease's origins.ByStefan LovgrenPublished June 12, 2003• 7 min readShareTweetEmailScientists now say that the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which is believed to have been transmitted to humans to become HIV-1—the virus that causes AIDS—didn't start its life in chimps.Instead, it was a product of separate viruses jumping from different monkey species into chimps, where they recombined to form a hybrid virus, according to a new study.Researchers believe the chimpanzee virus is a hybrid of the SIVs naturally infecting two different monkeys, the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) and the greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans). Chimps eat monkeys, which is likely how they acquired the monkey viruses. The hybrid virus then spread through the chimpanzee species, and was later transmitted to humans to become HIV-1.The study suggests striking parallels between SIV infection of chimps and HIV infection of humans. Just as chimps acquired viruses from two different sources, humans are infected by two distinct AIDS viruses: HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2, which humans acquired from sooty mangabey monkeys. "Because of the similarity between chimpanzees and humans, any virus that successfully adapts to spreading among chimps would be a candidate for a further jump to humans—a potential HIV-3," said Paul Sharp of the Institute of Genetics at University of Nottingham in England, who led the study.The discovery also spotlights how many of our most virulent viruses were transmitted across species. The jumping of viruses from animals to humans occurs all the time."

Evidence:"Your fluid intake is probably adequate if:
You rarely feel thirsty
Your urine is colorless or light yellow
Your doctor or dietitian can help you determine the amount of water that's right for you every day. To prevent dehydration and make sure your body has the fluids it needs, make water your beverage of choice. It's a good idea to drink a glass of water:

Should I worry about drinking too much water
Drinking too much water is rarely a problem for healthy, well-nourished adults. Athletes occasionally may drink too much water in an attempt to prevent dehydration during long or intense exercise.

Evidence:"This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.Other ways of getting HIV include:sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipmenttransmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeedingThe chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex. Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.Find HIV testing services near youThe only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.It's important to be aware that:emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hoursan early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to othersBoth positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV testhome testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few daysIf your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load."

“There’s not a lot of evidence to support the idea that Himalayan salt lamps provide some – if any – of the supposed health benefits,” says Dr. Vyas. One study did suggest that negative ions might decrease depression in some people. However, these lamps don’t produce enough negative ions to make a difference. Negative ions, in large enough quantities, have also been shown to kill dust mites in the air. But again, these lamps do not produce enough to have any real benefit. There is also no evidence to support the idea that the lamps can absorb toxins from the air around you."

Evidence:"The simple answer is that you can get pregnant while nursing. However, many moms experience a time of delayed fertility during breastfeeding. This is very common and is referred to in many places as the Lactation Amenorrhea Method (LAM) of contraception. As described in The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, the Lactation Amenorrhea Method of using breastfeeding to delay fertility needs all the following to be true:
Your periods have not returned. Your baby is exclusively and frequently fed from your breasts- this is especially important to remember when your little one begins sleeping through the night. It means not just that your baby does not have bottles, but also that they do not use a pacifier, in other words that all of your baby’s sucking needs are met at your breast."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"A retrospective cohort study attempted to uncover the difference in psychological and cognitive disorders between persistent and non-persistent statin users. After analyzing statin users and ICD-9 codes for psychological diseases the outcomes data from the study showed that non-persistent statin users actually had a greater risk of being diagnosed with cognitive disorders compared with persistent users [24]. The authors hypothesized persistent statin use may be protective against developing cognitive dysfunction. However, the findings may be a result of reverse causality since non-persistent patients may be non-persistent because of their cognitive condition.A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was designed to address the FDA announcement regarding the effect of statins on cognition as well [6]. Cognitive impairment was rarely reported in trials involving either cognitively normal or impaired participants. Meta-analyses also showed no difference in the incidence of mild cognitive impairment between statin users and non-users."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Some of the participants took the vitamin C over a period of several years.Research resultsThe studies showed that it wasn't possible to prevent colds by taking vitamin C every day over a longer period of time. But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. These results have now been confirmed by other researchers as well, especially regarding use in children. It didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women who started taking it only after they became ill.Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in connection with extremely cold temperatures. Examples include marathon runners or soldiers doing winter exercises in a mountainous region.The study participants started taking vitamin C two to three weeks before the very strenuous activities, with the aim of preventing colds."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Here Dr. Deeter shares some important information about cancer prevention. Nicholas Deeter, DO, Ridgeview Clinics, shares that, “Processed meats are to colon cancer what smoking is to lung cancer.” Processed meats are known carcinogens. In fact, they are classified in the same group of carcinogens (Group 1) as tobacco and alcohol by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A diet high in red meats and processed meats—like bacon, hot dogs and deli meat—can raise your colorectal cancer risk significantly. To lower your risk, Dr. Deeter recommends eating less or no processed meats, likewise for red meat. “If giving up red meat is not realistic for you, start with small changes like cutting it out of your meals one day a week, eating smaller, three to four-ounce, portion sizes, and choosing local, organic, grass-fed meat,” he added."
Question:Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?

Yes

Evidence:"They can vary in colour and size – from a few millimetres up to 5cm wide.Skin tags are usually found on the neck, armpits, around the groin, or under the breasts. They can also grow on the eyelids or under the folds of the buttocks.They can look like warts, but skin tags are usually:smooth and soft (warts tend to be rougher with an irregular surface)knobbly and hang off the skin (warts are usually slightly raised or flat)not contagious (warts spread very easily, so a sudden outbreak or cluster of growths is more likely to be warts)Skin tags do not usually cause any pain or discomfort. Why skin tags occurSkin tags are made of loose collagen fibres and blood vessels surrounded by skin. Collagen is a type of protein found throughout the body. Both men and women can develop skin tags. They tend to occur in older people and people who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.Pregnant women may also be more likely to develop skin tags as a result of changes in their hormone levels."

Evidence:"Additional information about USB-shaped e-cigarettes and actions that parents, educators, and health care providers can take to protect kids is available at CDC’s Infographic [PDF – 1.2MB]
Top of PageWhy Is Nicotine Unsafe for Kids, Teens, and Young Adults? Most e-cigarettes (vapes) contain nicotine—the addictive drug in regular cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products. A CDC study found that 99% of the e-cigarettes sold in assessed venues in the United States contained nicotine.1
Some vape product labels do not disclose that they contain nicotine, and some vape liquids marketed as containing 0% nicotine have been found to contain nicotine. Nicotine can harm the developing adolescent brain.2 The brain keeps developing until about age 25. Using nicotine in adolescence can harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control.2

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"If you are taking beta-blocker medications for cardiovascular disease, you should also eat fewer bananas, as this class of medications raises potassium levels in the blood.In general, most people with diabetes can eat one or two medium-sized bananas a day, keeping in mind what other fruit you are consuming.Risks of overeating bananasEating too many bananas, especially overripe ones, can raise your blood sugar significantly. You should not eat an entire bunch of bananas at once. Bananas have also been associated with weight gain, which can contribute to the effects of diabetes. Diabetes can contribute to weight gain, and diabetic medications often have weight gain as a side effect, including insulin.However, it is not true that eating too many bananas can cause hyperkalemia. Unless you have kidney disease or are taking medicine that affects potassium levels, the amount of potassium in bananas is normally not high enough to affect your potassium levels.Unripe bananas can sometimes cause constipation, so be careful if you are prone to it. If you have constipation after eating a meal containing unripe bananas, be aware that they could be the culprit."

The radiofrequency EMF given off by Wi-Fi is a type of non-ionizing radiation. The level of radiofrequency EMF emitted from a Wi-Fi device must comply with the Canadian standards established for radiocommunication devices. Health effects of Wi-Fi
There are no health risks from exposure to radiofrequency EMF from Wi-Fi devices in your home, in schools or other areas accessible to the public. These devices must meet standards to ensure they do not exceed radiofrequency EMF exposure limits. While some of the radiofrequency EMF emitted by Wi-Fi is absorbed in your body, the amount largely depends on:
the strength of the signal
how close your body is to a Wi-Fi enabled device
Measurements of the radiofrequency EMF level from multiple Wi-Fi sources and Wi-Fi enabled devices operating at the same time in the same room were far below the human exposure limits in Safety Code 6. Based on the current scientific evidence the level of radiofrequency EMF emitted from Wi-Fi devices is not harmful to health."
