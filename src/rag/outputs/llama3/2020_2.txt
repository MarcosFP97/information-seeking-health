EMA gives advice on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for COVID-19
Press release 18/03/2020
EMA is aware of reports, especially on social media, which raise questions about whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19).There is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19. EMA is monitoring the situation closely and will review any new information that becomes available on this issue in the context of the pandemic.In May 2019, EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) started a review of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines ibuprofen and ketoprofen​​​​​​ following a survey by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) which suggested that infection due to chickenpox (varicella) and some bacterial infections could be made worse by these medicines. The product information of many NSAIDs already contains warnings that their anti-inflammatory effects may hide the symptoms of a worsening infection. The PRAC is reviewing all available data to see if any additional measure is required.When starting treatment for fever or pain in COVID-19, patients and healthcare professionals should consider all available treatment options including paracetamol and NSAIDs. Each medicine has its own benefits and risks which are reflected in its product information and which should be considered along with EU national treatment guidelines, most of which recommend paracetamol as a first treatment option for fever or pain.In line with EU national treatment guidelines, patients and healthcare professionals can continue using NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) as per the approved product information. Current advice includes that these medicines are used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.Patients who have any questions should speak to their doctor or pharmacist."

Evidence:"UGM specialist in internal medicine, dr. RM. Agit Sena Adisetiadi, Sp.PD., said that viral information about gargling saltwater against Covid-19 was wrong. Saltwater gargling cannot prevent Covid-19 infection. "There is no medical evidence that explains that this can help prevent Covid-19," he explained on Monday (27/4) Gargling or drinking warm water with a mixture of salt or vinegar has long been used by people in the country as a way to relieve symptoms associated with flu and sore throat. Nevertheless, he emphasized once again; this method would not protect you from Covid-19.Drinking enough water about 2 liters or 8-9 glasses per day is one step to maintaining a healthy body. Besides, it also prevents dehydration.According to him, adhering to the Covid-19 preventive health protocol is the primary effort that must be made to avoid transmission of the virus."

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"There is no connection between 5G and COVID-19. The Coronavirus is a virus that is spread from one person to another through droplets that people sneeze, cough or exhale. 5G is the new generation of mobile network technology that is transmitted over non-ionising radio waves. There is no evidence that 5G is harmful to people’s health. The outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan is unrelated to 5G, and is thought to have originated in a seafood wholesale market.” The Science Media CentreThe Science Media Centre in Great Britain cites experts saying that the theories connecting 5G to COVID-19 demonstrate a “complete lack of understanding of the difference between cause and coincidence”.Prof Malcolm Sperrin, Director of the Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, said:“…The supposed correlation between 5G and its development in China reveals a complete lack of understanding of the difference between cause and coincidence. In the simplest terms there might have been a train leaving Wuhan station during 5G development, but the train departure was not caused by 5G.”Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, said:“The idea that COVID19 is caused by 5G mobile phone signals is complete rubbish."

Evidence:"How about an herbal tea that claims to cure COVID in 24-48 hours? It’s a representation the FTC says is steeped in deception. So we’ve joined forces with the FDA and the Department of Justice to file suit in federal court to challenge – among other things – allegedly false and deceptive claims that Earth Tea cures COVID-19 and that the defendants have clinical proof to back up their promises. According to the lawsuit, Sinclair and his companies sell a 16-ounce bottle of Earth Tea for $60. The defendants promote their product on their website and through social media posts and videos on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube."

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19
WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19
7 December 2021
News release
Reading time:
Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"Given these findings, pneumococcal vaccination is more important than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, the authors have presented positive reports of pneumococcal immunization in COVID-19 individuals with underlying medical problems. Despite the fact that the WHO has stated that bacterial vaccination does not protect against COVID-19 pneumonia, the authors have demonstrated that there is a correlation between pneumococcal disease and COVID-19 in terms of preventing increased morbidity and mortality from secondary infections and superinfections. The authors discussed why pneumococcal vaccination is important in the current pandemic context to improve the global health system in the fight against COVID-19. This study backs up the recommendation for pneumococcal disease immunization and the COVID-19 pandemic relief that comes with it. Journal reference:

Evidence:""It's very apparent from the data that we've seen that men are more commonly affected, more likely to be in the hospital, and also more likely to be in intensive care," says Louise. “When we analysed the data from our COVID symptom study, we also found that in the UK, men are more likely than women to need respiratory support after admission to hospital with COVID-19.”‍Could oestrogen have a protective effect against COVID-19?‍The differences between responses to viruses in men and women are likely to come down to a combination of factors, including genetics and sex hormones. Researchers have suggested that the female sex hormone oestrogen may play a particularly important role in protecting women against diseases like COVID-19. (Although oestrogen is usually thought of as a female hormones, males also produce oestrogen, but at much lower levels. )‍Studies of SARS, a disease closely related to COVID-19, in female mice showed that blocking or removing oestrogen increased the number of inflammatory cells in the animals’ lungs, making them more likely to suffer severe effects of the disease. Furthermore, researchers in Wuhan, China, measured the oestrogen levels of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and found that women with low oestrogen levels tended to have more severe COVID-19 than women with higher levels of the hormone.‍What about post-menopausal women?"

Provide an answer to the question using the provided evidence and contrasting it with your internal knowledge.
Evidence:"But the researchers said the findings are concerning enough for them to advise cough sufferers who might be infected with coronavirus to avoid these medications.Given that cough suppressants are likely to be widely used by people with coronavirus infections — whether they’ve got an official diagnosis or not — the researchers called for more research on dextromethorphan’s safety. Dextromethorphan stifles signals in the brain that set off the reflex to cough. It is a key ingredient of virtually all over-the-counter cough and cold formulations, including those sold as Robitussin, Benylyn, DayQuil/NyQuil, Delsym, Triaminic, and Theraflu.In tests conducted at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, researchers found that when dextromethorphan was introduced into the cells of African green monkeys growing in petri dishes, the subsequent addition of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in more prolific viral growth.UC San Francisco pharmacologist Nevan J. Krogan, one of the team’s leaders, said that the group had alerted officials overseeing the government’s COVID-19 response to its concerns.The findings were reported Thursday in the journal Nature. But the group’s discoveries raise hopes as well. Science & Medicine  Could a ‘controlled avalanche’ stop the coronavirus faster, and with fewer deaths? Israeli scientists say they can mimic the effects of a vaccination campaign if certain people willingly get infected with the coronavirus and recover."

Evidence:"The livelihood of farmers and the people engaged in the entire value chain have been affected. I humbly request people not to fall prey to such rumours,” the minister had said.While medical practitioners across the world have said there is no cure as such for coronavirus, Chakrapani claimed that cow urine is the “only cure” for COVID-19 and requested global leaders to consume the “miracle liquid” and lead by example in the fight against the contagious viral disease.

Evidence:"As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS- CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45°C vs. 37°C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.

Evidence:"The researchers are confident that the lamps would also destroy the virus that causes Covid-19: Experiments in a different setting by other teams have shown that far-UVC does inactivate SARS-CoV-2, perhaps because UV light damages the genome of the virus. Some health experts argue that disinfecting indoor spaces with light could be a game-changer as the world opens up and the memory of lockdowns — for most of us — slowly fades. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can become airborne via the floating particles emitted when people breathe, speak, shout or sing. Virus-laden plumes can hang in the air indoors and spread disease. For more than two and a half years, scientists and government officials around the world have promoted a string of preventive measures — handwashing, vaccination, social distancing, mask-wearing, ventilation. None of them is perfect; they are often described as layers in a “Swiss cheese model” of risk reduction."

ABSTRACT
                                    In order to cope with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for effective prevention and control measures. This study aims to explore the positive action of black seeds (BS) against COVID-19 in patients involved in the trail. It is a descriptive, comparative, and open-label study. In our study, (419) participants were divided into two groups.The studied participants included patients which received standard care treatment as a control group (CON), while the (BS) group were patients received black seeds at a 40 mg/kg dose orally, once daily for 14 days plus standard protocol of treatment. The evidence of BS efficacy was obvious in the severity and outcome of infection with covid-19."

Evidence:"Oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B ([7,8]).It can inhibit the spread of the influenza virus and reduce viral shedding in respiratory secretions in the human body [8], and is considered a therapeutic option in several clinical trials and studies, but the results remain controversial ([9,10]). More studies are required there to demonstrate the efficacy of antiviral drugs in the treatment of patients with Covid-19.In this study, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of Oseltamivir, by comparing two different combination therapeutic regimens, based on length of hospital stay, need for admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation and mortality rate.2. Material and methods2.1. Study designThis was a retrospective analysis of a single center, cohort study, performed between Feb 20, 2020, and April 20, 2020, in patients with Covid-19 infection, at (XXX), a center for pandemic Covid-19 infected patients, (XXX).This study including 285 confirmed, Covid-19 infected patients who were admitted to this hospital during two months and received two different therapeutic regimens according to the guidelines issued by Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (first edition(11), fifth edition(12).The first group including 120 inpatients between Feb 20, 2020 and March 15, 2020 who received Oseltamivir in addition with routine regimen (combination group) [11].The second group including 165 patients between March 20, 2020 and April 20, 2020 received routine regimen alone (control group) [12].2.2. Study populationThe confirmed Covid-19 infected in patients with mild to severe disease were enrolled in the study, according to their clinical symptoms with a positive diagnostic kit result (RT-PCR) or typical radiologic changes on chest computed tomography (CT) [13], with the approval of the specialist in this hospital for the diagnosis of Covid-19, and clinical requirement of hospitalization(11).The patient's medical information including demographic data, clinical features, the result of Covid-19 test (PCR), chest CT scans, comorbidities, and underling disease (hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular and kidney disease), the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the requirement of mechanical ventilation, the duration of hospitalization, their outcome, and mortality, extracted from hospital documented patient's data recorded in this hospital.Patients with a history of allergic reactions or known contraindications (QT-prolongation) or drug interactions with routine regimens, or lack of data in their documents, and the patients who die within the first 24 h of hospitalization, exclude from study.The patients in this study were enrolled by simple random sampling without stratification.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the (XXX).Written informed consent was obtained from all patients when admitted to the hospital. patients’ confidentiality was considered by protecting their data and documents.2.3."

Evidence:"Drinking alcohol can make coronavirus worse, WHO says, recommending restricted accessSkip NavigationMarketsPre-MarketsU.S. "Therefore, people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic," the office said. A view of people waiting in line at Cork & Bottle liquor store on 1st Avenue as the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States on March 21, 2020 in New York City.Cindy Ord | Getty ImagesDrinking alcohol can increase the risk of catching Covid-19 and make it worse if you do get it, the World Health Organization said, recommending that government leaders around the world limit access to alcohol during coronavirus lockdowns. "Alcohol compromises the body's immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes," the WHO's regional office for Europe said on its site late Tuesday, citing heavy alcohol use throughout the continent.Alcohol consumption is associated with a number of communicable and noncommunicable diseases that can make a person more vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. It can also exacerbate mental health issues and risk-taking behavior and stoke violence, especially in countries that have implemented social distancing measures that largely keep the population quarantined in their homes.The WHO also published a fact sheet dispelling the "dangerous myth that consuming high-strength alcohol can kill" the coronavirus."

Evidence:"Although higher humidity may increase the atmospheric suspended matter [22], the amount of virus deposited on surfaces, and virus survival time in droplets on surfaces [44], the reduction of the virus spread by indirect air transmission may be an important factor behind the reduced spreading of COVID-19 in a humid climate. High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39]. The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47]. Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48]. Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35]. Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection."

Evidence:"Other traits add to remdesivir's appeal. It's the only early treatment available to children under 12. Plus it works against omicron – while some other early treatment options do not. And, while other early treatments are in short supply, there's plenty of remdesivir to go around. Federal agencies now recommend remdesivir as one of four options for treating early COVID-19. These medicines, when started within five to 10 days of the onset of symptoms, could help patients who might get very sick from COVID-19 — such as some patients with cancer or chronic lung disease — rid their systems of the virus."

Evidence:"Hence, we propose the hypothesis that vegetarian diets might prevent heart and kidney diseases as well as strengthen the immune system and lower comorbidities. The presence of fewer comorbidities may influence the severity of COVID-19 indirectly. An epidemiologic prospective cohort study by Merino et al. (1) suggests that plant-based foods were associated with lower severity of COVID-19, especially in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation. In our study, the hospital setting enrolled a more severe and critical COVID-19 population and when there was no COVID-19 vaccination during pandemics, our findings agree with the results of their study. However, we did not explore other supplements of Vitamin B12, D3, or blood tests in our study population because it was a retrospective study."

Evidence:"Multivariable analysis—After adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, English proficiency, comorbid conditions and date of study entry, ACEI/ARB use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P=0.00). The results were similar when ACEI and ARB use were analyzed separately. Sensitivity Analyses
The strength of the association between ACEI/ARB use and decreased COVID-19 risk was similar in all subgroups studied: diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease; age ≥65; and body mass index ≥30. No other medication classes were associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19. Support for the Current Guidance
Results from this observational study do not prove ACEIs/ARBs protect against COVID-19. However, they support the current professional society recommendations that the use of these medications should not be discontinued because of concern about COVID-19."

Evidence:"The World Health Organization said “Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases.”
Are smokers more or less likely to catch Covid-19? We don’t know for sure whether or not smokers are more likely to catch coronavirus, although we do know they are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. On the one hand, some early articles suggested that smoking could increase your chances of being infected, as smokers tend to touch their face and mouth more often. On the other hand, a recent evidence review by London researchers suggests people who currently smoke may be less likely to be infected with coronavirus. One study suggests this could be because nicotine interferes with ACE2 receptors, which may prevent the virus from entering cells. The researchers said that more scientific research is needed to understand these mixed findings, as the link is still not clear."

Data from tested subjects were compared with 2,204,742 nontested individuals, which accounted for nearly 40% of the total Danish population. The authors found that individuals with type O blood were relatively protected from viral infection (relative risk (RR) = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.91). Unlike previous studies, however, there was no difference between ABO blood type and progression of illness to hospitalization or mortality (each, P > .40). Rh typing was not collected in this analysis.In our investigation, we performed a multi-institutional analysis across 5 hospitals in the New England region [18].

Evidence:"‘Handwashing has always been one of most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention. Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we live through this pandemic, and beyond, to protect us from diseases,’ said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. With COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance. To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste."

Google Scholar—on the basis of cellular and animal studies—that nicotine might reduce the risk of COVID-19 by either competing with the virus for surface binding or attenuating inflammation must, at the very least, be treated with great caution. Indeed, the limited published evidence to date on the effect of nicotine on airway cells in vitro suggests that it can induce rapid and long-lasting increases in gene and protein expression of ACE2, which in turn increases the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in cells and cause a cytopathic effect.11Maggi F Rosellini A Spezia PG et al.Nicotine upregulates ACE2 expression and increases competence for SARS-CoV-2 in human pneumocytes.ERJ Open Res. 2021; 7 (00713-2020. )Crossref

Evidence:"New Evidence Suggests ‘Yes’
URMC co-authored study indicates that breastfeeding is safe for COVID positive mothers
A study conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) – in collaboration with several other universities - indicates that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk, but do confer milk-borne antibodies that are able to neutralize the virus. Drs. Bridget Young, Kirsi Jarvinen-Seppo and Antti Seppo were part of the breast milk research team
The study, “Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, antibodies, and neutralizing capacity in milk produced by women with COVID-19,” published on February 9 in the journal mBio – analyzed 37 milk samples submitted by 18 women diagnosed with COVID-19. None of the milk samples were found to contain the virus, while nearly two thirds of the samples did contain two antibodies specific to the virus. Critically, this study provides evidence that COVID-19 positive mothers should not be separated from their newborn children. At the onset of the pandemic, major health organizations have often provided contradictory advice on whether this separation was necessary."

Evidence:"Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two of these proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines mimic the spike and membrane proteins that permit the virus to infect cells. This suggests pneumococcal vaccination may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two other mimics are the nucleoprotein and replicase that control virus replication."

Hao Chen, an associate professor at the Department of Gastroenterology at Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital in China and an author of the study, told Verywell that “the results from previous studies on the association between fish oil supplements and COVID-19-related outcomes remain controversial.”
Specifically, Chen said that while past studies have suggested the protective role of fish oil supplements against COVID infection, “the statistical power of previous studies was limited, resulting from their defects of small sample sizes or insufficient study designs.”

Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases; that's why some people have been naturally worried about mosquitoes carrying SARS-CoV-2. Official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) says there's no information or evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites. For a mosquito to become infected with a virus, it must be present in the blood the mosquito feeds on. "SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a respiratory virus that is almost exclusively contained within the lungs and respiratory tract of infected people, and rarely gets into the blood," Emily Gallichotte, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of microbiology, immunology, and pathology at Colorado State University, told Health. Mosquitoes are very genetically different from humans."

While the post does not claim it is for the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), the timing and the comments on the post suggest that it may be for this purpose due to the shortage of hand sanitizer (see more on this  here ). The recipe includes 6 tbsp vodka, 4 tbsp aloe vera, 10 drops lavender oil, 10 drops tea tree oil.During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommend washing hands frequently with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (see here )Vodka usually contains 35-46% alcohol by volume (see: here ). This would not suffice to make it effective to fight coronavirus.The CDC explains why lower alcohol concentration is less desirable generally, here :“Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60–95% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizers without 60-95% alcohol 1) may not work equally well for many types of germs; and 2) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright.“The WHO released a guide for local production of handrub which includes two recipes that differ greatly from the claim (see  here ). While this is not specifically formulated for the coronavirus outbreak, the two recommended recipes for local production include Ethanol 96% and Isopropyl alcohol 99.8%."
