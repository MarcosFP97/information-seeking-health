Evidence:"Because cell phones usually are held near the head when a person is on a call, the main concern has been whether the phones might cause or contribute to tumors in this area, including:
Malignant (cancerous) brain tumors, such as gliomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the brain, such as meningiomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the nerve connecting the brain to the ear (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas)
Tumors of the salivary glands
A few studies have also looked at possible links to other types of cancer. What do studies show? Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to determine if something might cause cancer:
Studies done in the lab (using lab animals or cell cultures)
Studies looking at groups of people
In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own to show if something causes cancer in people, so researchers usually look at both lab-based and human studies. The following is a brief summary of some of the major studies that have looked at this issue to date. However, this is not a comprehensive review of all studies that have been done."

Hi Dale, Some people find WD-40 can help with arthritis, not as a treatment but by being a helping hand for many every day activities. Activities such as helping sliding doors glide easier, unsticking difficult to open windows, keeping scissors and garden tools working smoothly to name a few. Reply

   Summary  
Baking soda is an alkaline mineral (meaning it can neutralize acidity) that is used in a variety of ways. Since cancer cells flourish in acidic environments, some people believe that baking soda may help neutralize acidity in the body to help fight against cancer. Baking soda does not prevent or cure cancer, but animal studies and small trials suggest it may help make chemotherapy and other cancer treatments more effective. Though baking soda shows promise as a complementary treatment, the lack of human clinical trials means that you must approach its use with caution. A Word From Verywell

Evidence:"Start visitLearn moreDo Other ACE Inhibitors Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Several other ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and other heart health issues. These include benazepril (Lotensin®), enalapril (Vasotec®), candesartan (Atacand®), fosinopril (Monopril®) and others.In general, erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect of ACE inhibitors. Other medications for high blood pressure, including alpha-blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), also rarely contribute to ED.Is it Safe to Use ED Medication with Lisinopril?Currently, the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction are PDE5 inhibitor medications, such as sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), vardenafil (Levitra®) and avanafil (Stendra®).These medications work by increasing the rate of blood flow to the erectile tissue of your penis, making it easier to get and maintain an erection when you’re sexually aroused. Because PDE5 inhibitors and anti-hypertensive medications both improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, there’s a risk of interactions when ED medications are used with some common medications for high blood pressure. For example, many medications for ED can interact with organic nitrates and nitrites, as well as alpha-blockers used to treat high blood pressure and/or heart failure. Our guide to Viagra and nitrates provides more information on these interactions and their often severe health risks.Research suggests that ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, on the other hand, do not increase the risk of side effects with ED medications such as sildenafil.If you currently use lisinopril or other medication to control your blood pressure, it’s important to inform your healthcare provider about this before using any ED medications.How to Maintain Healthy ErectionsIf you’re prescribed lisinopril or similar medication to treat high blood pressure, there are several things that you can do to improve your erections and sexual health naturally:Keep active."

Evidence:"David Goldman/AP
From celebrity trainers working in the trendiest Manhattan gyms to the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis and the US Army training exams, sit-ups are developing a bad reputation. Scientists have discovered that the moves, once a staple of basic workout routines, don't reduce waistline circumference or trim belly fat. Sit-ups are also not the best way to strengthen your core or to keep it flexible and strong for the long run.Last week, the US Army announced that after decades of requiring two-minute sit-up tests, it would phase out that portion of its fitness test by the end of 2020. Instead, the Army says it'll make room for some fitness tasks found to be more useful for soldiers' combat readiness, like deadlifts, power throws, and drag-and-carry moves, The Washington Times reported.It's a change that Tony Maloney, a trainer and exercise physiologist at the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, can get behind. "I'm not a huge fan of sit-ups," Maloney told Business Insider earlier this year. "Reason being, it can cause some spinal problems, especially if they're not done properly.""

Evidence:"You can see from the messages we have included below that, at least for those that contacted us:
Their stuttering was directly connected to being forced to change writing hands at a young age
It had a dramatic negative effect on them, often lasting their whole lives
In some case at least, once they changed back to writing left-handed their stuttering stopped
Now this is only anecdotal evidence but it is pretty clear! There has been research over the years that has found the percentage of stutterers who are left handed is much higher than the general population but that was not specifically linked to forced hand change (and would depend whether the people who had been changed were still classed as “left-handers” in the research!). There was also one piece of research as far back as 1940 that actually indicated that lefthanders were LESS likely to be stutterers (but again definitions can cause a problem as the lefthanders who were   forced to change and then stuttered may well have been counted as right-handers!). We have not been able to find any solid research about this and on the British Stammering Association website it is not mentioned apart from very briefly in a couple of contributed articles, again with no actual research background."

Evidence:"Despite the fact that pink Himalayan salt only contains tiny amounts of additional minerals, many people still claim that it can provide a number of health benefits.The truth is, most of these claims do not have any research to support them. Some of pink Himalayan salt’s commonly promoted health claims include that it can: Improve respiratory diseasesBalance your body’s pHReduce signs of agingImprove sleep qualityRegulate blood sugarIncrease libidoSome of the claims related to the non-dietary uses of pink Himalayan salt may be loosely based on research.The use of salt caves as a treatment for various lung diseases has been evaluated in a few studies. The results suggest that there could be some benefit, but overall, more rigorous research is needed to investigate their effectiveness (7, 8, 9).On the other hand, some of these health claims are actually just normal functions of sodium chloride in the body, so you’ll get these benefits from any kind of salt.For example, researchers have found that very low-salt diets may contribute to sleeping problems (10). This suggests that an adequate amount of salt may be necessary for quality sleep. However, the study did not examine pink Himalayan salt and it is likely a function of the sodium chloride in any salt.Also, the minerals in pink Himalayan salt are not present in large enough quantities to have any effect on balancing the body’s pH.

Evidence:"Many people, including health-care providers and patient relatives, may easily contact with the sweat of HIV-infected patients. Although reference books assert that HIV does not transmit through sweat, to our knowledge, there is no systemic study which this statement is based upon. This study aims to investigate the potential of sweat to transmit HIV infection.METHODS:This study included 31 treatment-naive HIV RNA-positive patients who were in the acute phase of the infection and 26 subjects with a negative HIV RNA test who had received antiviral treatment. A total of 57 sweat samples collected from intact skin areas were prospectively evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HIV RNA. HIV RNA levels in the blood samples were also noted.RESULTS:HIV RNA was not detected by PCR in any sweat sample taken from HIV-infected HIV RNA-negative and -positive subjects.CONCLUSION:The findings obtained in this study suggest that sweat by itself has no potential for transmitting HIV infection.Keywords: HIV, HIV transmission route, polymerase chain reaction, sweatHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a worldwide health problem [1]. Although the worldwide incidence of HIV infection has decreased, the prevalence of HIV infection has increased with the increased life expectancy among patients receiving antiviral treatment (ART) [2].Many studies reported that HIV was mainly transmitted through parenteral exposure, sexual activity, and body secretions, such as saliva and semen [1–3] A high HIV RNA level in blood is the greatest risk factor for the transmission of HIV [4] Risk of transmission can be reduced through early diagnosis, protection and decreasing HIV RNA levels by early treatment [5].HIV-positive individuals get in contact with others in their daily lives."

Evidence:"In 2012, questions surfaced when the FDA issued a warning that statin users had reported short-term cognitive impairment when taking the drugs. A study published June 29, 2021, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) aimed to shed some additional light on this issue. Researchers looked at data on statin use among 18,446 people, ages 65 or older, who had taken part in a large randomized trial of aspirin. The researchers found that over a follow-up period of almost five years, people who took statins weren’t any more likely than non-users to have dementia. The same was true when it came to other changes in cognition, memory, language, executive function, or a measure called psychomotor speed, which measures how quickly someone can process information. They also found no differences between different types of statins."

Evidence:"Drinking it instead of higher-calorie beverages could help contribute to weight loss.It Can Keep You Hydrated From carrying nutrients to cells to transporting waste out of the body, drinking enough water to stay hydrated is a critical component of health.Maintaining adequate hydration is essential in everything from regulating body temperature to improving physical performance (5).Some evidence also suggests that staying hydrated can aid in weight loss.Research indicates that increased hydration may increase the breakdown of fats and enhance fat loss (6).Staying well-hydrated may also help reduce water retention, which can cause symptoms like bloating, puffiness and weight gain (7).Since the majority of lemon water is made up of water, it can help with maintaining adequate hydration.Summary: Drinking lemon water could help you stay hydrated, which reduces water retention and may increase fat loss.Drinking Lemon Water May Boost Metabolism Studies show that drinking enough water can potentially help increase your metabolism.Researchers suggest that good hydration enhances the function of mitochondria, a type of organelle found in cells that helps generate energy for the body (6).This leads to an increase in metabolism, which may lead to subsequent weight loss.Drinking water has also been shown to increase metabolism by inducing thermogenesis, a metabolic process in which calories are burned to produce heat.In one study, 14 participants drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water. Drinking water was found to increase their metabolic rate by 30% for 30–40 minutes (8).Another study looked at the effects of drinking water in 21 overweight children. Drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased metabolism by an impressive 25% for 40 minutes (9).Research on lemon water specifically is limited. However, because water is the main ingredient, it likely carries the same metabolism-boosting benefits as regular water.Summary: Studies show that drinking water could increase metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function and inducing thermogenesis.Lemon Water Can Make You Feel More Full Drinking water is often recommended as a fundamental part of any weight loss regimen, as it can promote satiety and fullness without adding calories.A 2008 study looked at the effects of water on calorie intake in 24 overweight and obese older adults.The study revealed that drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before breakfast decreased the number of calories consumed in the meal by 13% (10).Another study found that drinking water with a meal decreased hunger and increased satiety during the meal (11).Because lemon water is low in calories and can promote fullness in the same way as regular water, it can be an effective way to help reduce calorie intake.Summary: Regular water and lemon water can help promote satiety and fullness, which may decrease calorie intake and lead to weight loss.It Could Increase Weight Loss Due to its potential beneficial effects on metabolism, satiety and hydration, some evidence suggests that water (including lemon water) could enhance weight loss.In one study, 48 adults were assigned to two diets: a low-calorie diet with 16.9 oz (0.5 liters) of water prior to each meal or a low-calorie diet with no water before meals.At the end of the 12-week study, participants in the water group had lost 44% more weight than participants in the non-water group (12).Other research suggests that increasing water intake could help stimulate weight loss, independent of diet or exercise.A 2009 study measured water intake in 173 overweight women. It found that greater water intake was associated with a greater loss of body weight and fat over time, regardless of diet or physical activity (13).Though these studies focus specifically on regular water, the same results most likely apply to lemon water as well.Summary: Some studies suggest that drinking regular water or lemon water could increase weight loss, regardless of diet or exercise.Lemon Water Is Not Necessarily Better Than Regular Water Lemon water comes with a lot of potential benefits, from promoting hydration to increasing satiety.However, it’s important to note that these benefits all come from its main ingredient — water.Lemon water does contain some additional nutrients from the lemon juice, such as vitamin C and antioxidants, but these are unlikely to have any effect on your weight.Additionally, the alkalizing effect of lemon juice has no clear effects on weight.All that being said, lemon water may have some benefits for preventing kidney stones, due to the acids it contains (14, 15, 16) Summary: Lemon water may be beneficial for weight loss, but has no added benefits over regular water.How to Drink Lemon Water Lemon water is a highly customizable beverage and can be tailored based on personal preference.Recipes usually call for the juice from at least half a lemon mixed with a glass of water. To add more flavor, try adding in a few other ingredients.A few fresh mint leaves or a sprinkle of turmeric are delicious and healthy ways to spice up a glass of lemon water.Many people prefer to start their day with a refreshing glass of lemon water, but it can be enjoyed at any time of day.It can also be consumed hot, like tea, or with a few ice cubes added for a cool and invigorating drink.Despite claims that lemon water has greater benefits when consumed at certain temperatures, there is little evidence to support that it makes a difference.Summary: Lemon water can be customized based on personal preference, and it can be enjoyed hot or cold at any time of day.The Bottom Line Lemon water can promote fullness, support hydration, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.However, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to losing fat.That being said, it is tasty, easy to make and can be used as a low-calorie replacement for higher-calorie beverages.In this way, it could potentially help promote weight loss and improve health.How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Share this articleBy Rachael Link, MS, RD on June 11, 2017Read this nextCarbonated (Sparkling) Water: Good or Bad?By Franziska SpritzlerCarbonated (sparkling) water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas."

Evidence:"Eating processed meat increases your risk of bowel and stomach cancer. Red meat, such as beef, lamb and pork, has been classified as a Group 2A carcinogen which means it probably causes cancer. Did you know if you’ve had cancer, maintaining a healthy diet can help prevent it from coming back? How red and processed meat increase cancer risk  Current research shows that there are certain chemicals in red and processed meats – both added and naturally occurring – that cause these foods to be carcinogenic. For example, when a chemical in red meat called haem is broken down in the gut, N-nitroso chemicals are formed and these have been found to damage the cells that line the bowel, which can lead to bowel cancer. These same chemicals also form when processed meat is digested."

Evidence:"A person should work with a healthcare professional to define their target carb intake.A doctor or dietitian can also provide more detailed information on portion sizes and balancing intake of fiber, proteins, fats, and carbs in a practical way.A person should follow their diabetes meal plan closely.Keep in mind that eating a banana alongside another source of carbohydrates, such as a piece of toast or cereal, means that the overall carb intake from that meal is higher. Depending on a person’s meal plan and nutritional needs, a doctor or dietitian may recommend swapping out carbs in a later meal.Alternatively, after eating a meal that is lighter on carbs, a person can enjoy a small banana as a snack to balance their carb intake.Do bananas raise blood pressure?Bananas are rich in potassium, an important micronutrient that can support healthy blood pressure levels.In fact, one study found that frequent consumption of several types of fruit, including bananas, was linked to lower blood pressure levels.Furthermore, some research suggests that a potassium-rich diet could reduce the risk of stroke — a condition that is often the result of high blood pressure — by around 25%. NutritionOverall, bananas are nutrient-dense, low in saturated fat and sodium, and rich in fiber.They are also a key source of potassium, a mineral that helps balance sodium levels in the blood.Bananas provide a good mix of other nutrients, including:vitamin B6manganesemagnesiumvitamin CWho should avoid bananas?Individuals with diabetes can enjoy bananas and other fruits in moderation as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.However, a person should be sure to consult a doctor or dietitian before making any changes to their diet plan, especially if they are taking medications for diabetes or other health conditions.For instance, certain medications used to treat high blood pressure can increase levels of potassium in the blood, which could cause negative side effects if paired with a high potassium diet.Additionally, people with chronic kidney disease may need to limit their intake of potassium-rich foods such as bananas to prevent an increase in blood potassium levels.TakeawayA person with diabetes should include a variety of fresh, whole foods in their diet, such as nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables.Bananas are a safe and nutritious fruit for people with diabetes to eat in moderation as part of a balanced, individualized eating plan.For a more precise diet plan or personalized recommendations, it is a good idea to consult a registered dietitian or diabetes specialist.Q:I know bananas contain a lot of potassium. Does this help reduce the effects of diabetes?A:Potassium is an important nutrient for many processes in the body, such as regulating nerve signals, balancing fluid levels, and supporting muscle contraction.Potassium can be helpful in decreasing complications from diabetes and managing comorbidities, including high blood pressure.It is an important nutrient for decreasing cardiovascular risks, which are often present in those with poorly managed diabetes.

This may naturally lead to lower calorie intake. However, it could worsen gastroparesis for some.It may help you lose weight and body fatResults from a small but widely cited 2009 study indicate that apple cider vinegar has impressive effects on weight and body fat (7).In this 12-week study, 144 Japanese adults with obesity consumed either 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vinegar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, or a placebo drink every day.They were told to restrict their alcohol intake but otherwise continue their usual diet and activity throughout the study.Participants who consumed 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day had — on average — the following benefits:Weight loss: 2.6 pounds (lb), or 1.2 kilograms (kg)Decrease in body fat percentage: 18%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.5 inches (in), or 1.4 centimeters (cm)Decrease in triglycerides: 26%This is what changed in participants who consumed 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day:Weight loss: 4.2 lb, or 1.7 kgDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in, or 1.9 cmDecrease in triglycerides: 26%The placebo group actually gained 0.9 lb (0.4 kg), and their waist circumference slightly increased.In a 2018 clinical trial involving 39 participants on restricted calorie diets, those who consumed about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar (8).According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your body fat percentage, help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood triglycerides.These are two of only a few human studies that have investigated apple cider vinegar’s effects on weight loss. Although the results are encouraging, additional studies are needed.SummaryIn two studies, people with obesity who took 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost weight and body fat.Other health benefitsIn addition to promoting weight and fat loss, apple cider vinegar has several other benefits:Lowers blood sugar and insulin: When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating (4).Improves insulin sensitivity: Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal may improve insulin sensitivity (9).Lowers fasting blood sugar: Studies have found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (10).Improves polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms: In a small 2013 study of women with PCOS who took vinegar for 90–110 days, 57% resumed ovulation, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity (11).Decreases cholesterol levels: A 2021 research review of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides (12).Lowers blood pressure: Animal studies suggest that vinegar may decrease blood pressure by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for constricting blood vessels. However, human studies haven’t shown significant decreases in blood pressure (13, 14).Kills harmful bacteria and viruses: Studies show that apple cider vinegar may be a powerful fighter against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria as well as resistant Escherichia coli (rE."
