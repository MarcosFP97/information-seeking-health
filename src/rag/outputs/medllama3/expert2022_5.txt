Evidence:"It is a major part of the healing process, after which a blood clot forms over the extraction site. The use of tea bags for bleeding tooth extraction is popular in oral surgery to stop bleeding. Green and black tea contain tannins, which are natural chemicals found in caffeinated tea. The tannins contribute to the tea’s bitter flavour. The tannins in green or black tea that has caffeine have astringent capabilities and stimulate further blood clotting."

Evidence:"Or are crystals truly just pretty objects that offer up some sort of placebo effect that can convince us something more magical is at play?First, let’s consider the primary argument for crystals as healing conduits. In short, the belief is that certain stones can help guide healing energy into the body, while ushering out negative, disease-causing energy. This supposedly occurs through your body’s energy field, or chakra; the energy is variably referred to as “qi,” “prana,” or “universal energy,” according to Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator at McGill Office for Science & Society in Montréal.Crystals are often incorporated into practices like reiki, a Japanese form of energy healing, and in specific crystal-healing practices like “crystal surgery,” wherein a practitioner uses crystals as tools for “operating” on the body’s energy field (don’t worry, it’s not an invasive practice—no scalpel required). In these treatments, practitioners attempt to “unblock” areas of our energy field that are “stuck.”But it’s not so easy to measure whether such bodily energy exists in the first place, Jarry says. Scientists can study other forms of energy, like gravity or the energy contained in food, because we can see an apple fall from a tree, and we can zoom in on the process of glucose from an apple breaking down into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for our cells. Still, scientists have tried."

Evidence:"A 2016 study published in Nutrition Journal divided 191 people with osteoarthritis into three groups: one group received placebo; one group received UC-II and the third group received chondroitin sulfate supplements. After 180 days of treatment, the UC-II group had better pain, stiffness, and function than the placebo group (and a bit better than the chondroitin group). UC-II studies done on people with rheumatoid arthritis have had mixed results. A 2009 double-blind trial that included more than 500 people with RA  found that undenatured collagen improved participants’ pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count and swollen joint count, but not as well as methotrexate. The study, published in Arthritis Research and Therapy, concluded that UC-II is safe and effective in the treatment of RA. “There’s not enough evidence to say that every patient with arthritis would benefit from any collagen supplement."

Am I more at risk if my relatives have cancer? Some types of cancer can run in families. For example, your risks of developing certain types of breast cancer, bowel cancer or ovarian cancer are higher if you have close relatives who developed the condition.This doesn't mean you'll definitely get cancer if some of your close family members have it, but that you may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with other people.It's estimated that between 3 and 10 in every 100 cancers are associated with an inherited faulty gene.Cancers caused by inherited faulty genes are much less common than those caused by other factors, such as ageing, smoking, being overweight and not exercising regularly, or not eating a healthy, balanced diet. Most cancers develop as a result of a combination of risk factors, which in some cases can include family history.Some types of cancer are less likely to be genetic, such as cervical cancer and lung cancer.It's only likely that a cancer gene is present in a family if:there are 2 or more close relatives on the same side of the family (your mother's or your father's side) with the same type of cancer, or with particular types of cancer that are known to be linked – for example, breast and ovarian cancer or bowel and womb cancercancers are occurring at young ages (before the age of 50)a close relative has had 2 different types of cancer (rather than 1 cancer that has spread)You should contact your GP if some close family members have developed the types of cancer mentioned above and you're worried that you might develop cancer yourself. They'll ask about your family history, and if they think there's a chance you have an increased risk of developing cancer, they'll refer you to a genetic counsellor, family cancer clinic or a cancer specialist.Cancer Research UK has more information about family history and inherited cancer genes

Evidence:"“In healthy cells, too, there is an increase in acidity when rapid energy production is required, but in cancer cells it is the dominant energy-generating pathway; acidity makes cancer cells more aggressive and more metastatic. Introducing baking soda into the method we developed will reduce the necessary drug dosage and therefore could reduce side effects.”
The study showed that the aforementioned treatment, which affects the tumor’s environment, intensifies the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy drugs. The study also shows the positive effects of a combined treatment, which attacks several components at the same time and weakens the tumor environment. “Suffocating” the tumor 
The innovation of her doctoral research is not limited to the original use of baking soda but includes a more comprehensive view of the cancerous tumor and, more importantly, its environment. “Many studies show and emphasize the importance of the tumor environment in supporting cancer cells, and in facilitating the cancer cells’ ability to penetrate nearby tissues and metastasize throughout the body,” she says. “In addition, changes in the environment of the cancerous tumor tissue may affect the tumor’s response to treatments and promote the development of resistance to the anti-cancer treatment."

Evidence:"Are Squats Bad for Your Knees? While there are some reports or rumors that state squats are bad for your knees, studies do not agree with this statement. Even with Olympic weightlifters, athletes who perform squats regularly, it has been observed that the prevalence of injury is very low. A 1999 paper published in the Journal of Athletic Training observed 27 Olympic weightlifters for a period of six years. The prevalence of injury occurring was calculated to be around 3.3 events per 1000 hours of training. Injury events observed by the researchers required a day or less of missed training for 87.3% of the cases, and less than a week for the rest."

Evidence:"However, other BP drugs, such as alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angioten-sin-receptor blockers, rarely cause ED. Some research even suggests the effect of blood pressure drugs may be more psychological than physical. When ED occurs after a man begins to take a new medication, it's possible that anxiety about his health, rather than the medication, may trigger the problem. And being aware of possible side effects may make a man more likely to recognize them as abnormal. According to Harvard Special Health Report Erectile Dysfunction, one study in the European Heart Journal looked at men newly diagnosed with heart disease, but without ED, who started treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol (Tenormin). Some of the study participants were told about the sexual side effect of the blood pressure drug, and ED was reported by almost one-third of the participants."

Evidence:"Morphine is typically only used in a healthcare setting, like hospitals. Morphine is exceedingly addictive, especially when taken in larger doses or when injected or inhaled. Many people start taking morphine in the hospital for surgery. It is also prescribed for outpatient use as MS-Contin.

Evidence:"“There is a lot of talk in the literature about whether juice is good or bad, and I think the findings from this study suggest that 100 percent juice does not have an adverse effect, or positive — it’s a neutral effect,” said Murphy.Prior research, including a Harvard study in 2013, has pointed to fruit juice as harmful rather than beneficial in terms of diabetes risk.Harvard researchers looked at the role of fruit and fruit juice in the diets of more than 180,000 British adults and concluded that whole fruit consumption led to an overall decrease in type 2 diabetes risk. Juice consumption led to an 8 percent increase.“Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids, even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits,” said Qi Sun, one of the study’s authors.Sysy Morales, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for 23 years, cautioned readers about the new study on her blog Diabetes Daily.She noted the metrics were taken on participants’ blood sugar levels after they had fasted. She said the participants were healthy and should show normal blood sugar levels after fasting.She added the study does seem legitimate, but she noted that the sugar in even “natural” fruit juice is still fructose.The American Diabetes Association agrees with Morales.“This meta-analysis examined 16 studies, none of which included people with diabetes, and none of which measured blood glucose levels soon after consuming juice — only fasting blood glucose levels,” the organization said in its statement.Defending the researchDespite the criticism, Murphy defends her team’s research. “These results are suggesting a very neutral effect in the diet, which is consistent with other research,” said Murphy.Murphy argues that there are still plenty of individuals who would benefit from 100 percent fruit juice.“We would never encourage individuals to get all of their fruit servings from juice, but certainly many people fall short of their fruit and vegetable servings, and 100 percent juices may be a way to help reach that 100 percent of that recommended intake,” she said.Research that is “industry funded” has been the target of consumer groups in recent years.A major study funded by cranberry giant Ocean Spray in 2016 about the benefits of cranberry juice consumption to treat urinary tract infections was called out by members of the media as “smoke and mirrors.”Ocean Spray continues to fund research and, in a subsequent interview with Healthline, stood by their work, as well as pledged to continue investigating the health benefits of cranberries.However, Murphy said not all industry research is the same. “Funding source isn’t synonymous with quality of a study,” she said.“Good quality studies can be funded by industry."

      Fitness pros and weight-room buffs alike dismiss the sit-up as ineffective and pointless. Pretty much everyone, even those who don't hit the gym regularly, has probably heard there are so many better exercises for your abs. Advertisement
     Brian Jimenez, fitness coach and certified stretch therapist at Stretch Relief, tells LIVESTRONG.com that sit-ups "unfortunately and justifiably get a bad rap" because the move has little to do with actual core endurance, strength, stability or mobility. Video of the Day
      "Traditionally, the movement is usually done for high repetitions and speed," Jimenez explains, noting that this can lead to poor technique and thus injury."

Evidence:"While many of the advances of antique medicine were forgotten after the fall of the Roman Empire, the use of urine and other excrements enjoyed continued popularity in mediaeval times. Ancient Indian yogic texts and ancient Chinese documents describe benefits of drinking one’s own urine, and it can be assumed that people in Africa, the Americas and other parts of the world have traditionally used urine for various medical indications for a very long time, too.The almost 100,000 hits of the search for “urine therapy” on Google, and the over 150 videos on the subject on YouTube are an indicator that drinking “waters out of thine own cistern” is still, or again, rather popular today.The supposed indications for urine therapy, ancient or contemporary, are too numerous to recite. There is, it seems, virtually nothing urine won’t cure. Modern proponents use pseudoscience to explain the benefits of the various, mostly exaggerated, components of urine. Some hint at a conspiracy by the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry to keep the knowledge of the many fantastic healing properties of cheaply available urine a secret. There is no money to be made from urine, well, unless one was to write a book about its many virtues."

New Study Suggests A Way To Get Rid Of Cellulite Without Surgery Or CreamsThe report published by Cogent Medicine found that a certain manual massage technique could be the answer. But does it really work?By Julia BrucculieriJun 20, 2019, 05:45 AM EDT|Updated Jun 20, 2019There may be a way to treat cellulite without taking drastic measures or spending a ton of money on creams, according to a new study. The study, published in the medical journal Cogent Medicine, looked specifically at the effects of fascia manipulation on cellulite in adult women. Fascial manipulation is a type of manual massage treatment typically employed for pain relief, according to Northern Edge Physical Therapy. In certain cases, the vigorous nature of fascia manipulation can cause bruising and injury, and FasciaBlaster has faced lawsuits as a result.Advertisement
n the study, the subjects used a specific fascial massage tool called the FasciaBlaster; it features rounded plastic massage claws placed in a line along a rod that you rub over the areas you want to treat."

Only the pure EPA type of fish oil has been shown to not raise LDL cholesterol.Omega-3 supplements may have health benefits other than for the heart. Some people experience relief from arthritis pain and depression, and it may have a role in decreasing inflammation.One study that got a lot of attention in 2013 suggested that taking fish oil might increase a man's risk of having prostate cancer. This caused much consternation, and led to many men stopping their supplements.

Evidence:"Yes, marijuana can be addictive.8 Although not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it, it is possible to develop a marijuana addiction or a cannabis use disorder. In 2020, approximately 14.2 million people aged 12 or older met the diagnostic criteria for a cannabis use disorder within the past year.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder, with a higher risk for people who begin using marijuana before the age of 18.5,7 Marijuana accounts for nearly half of admissions into substance use treatment for youth between the ages of 12 to 17.7
An individual who regularly uses marijuana may develop a cannabis use disorder, where cannabis use becomes uncontrollable and begins to impact normal functioning, such as failure to fulfill role responsibilities at home or work, physical dependence, and health problems.9
Cannabis use disorder can range from mild, to moderate, to severe. Severe forms of cannabis use disorder are often referred to as marijuana/cannabis addiction due to compulsive drug use behavior despite the negative impact it has on aspects of an individual’s life, including significant impairment across life domains—like interpersonal relationships, work and/or school performance, and negative effects on psychological and physical health.8,9
Withdrawal symptoms, an indicator of physiological dependence, can occur when an individual who has used cannabis frequently—such as daily or almost daily—abruptly stops using cannabis or significantly reduces their use.9 Withdrawal from marijuana can cause significant discomfort and distress, which may lead the person to return to marijuana use to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.9
Why Is Marijuana Addictive? Chronic cannabis use is associated with physiological changes in the brain that may contribute to the continued use of marijuana. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, appears to be responsible for marijuana’s reinforcing properties and a primary contributor to marijuana addiction.10,11 Results from empirical studies have shown that THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. Alterations in dopamine signaling or levels of dopamine are generally associated with other drugs of addiction.10
Signs of Marijuana Abuse and Addiction
Signs that a loved one might be using marijuana may include changes to their overall demeanor—such as being unusually giggly or uncoordinated—finding it hard to remember things that just happened, or finding marijuana-related paraphernalia like pipes, rolling papers, and vape pens in their possessions.7,12
If their use progresses to regular, heavy use and continues for a prolonged period, they may develop cannabis use disorder."

Jeffrey Soble, MD, a cardiologist at RUSH University Medical Center, began eating a plant-based diet nearly two year ago. Like others, improving his health — he has a family history of heart disease — played a significant role in that decision. Research has shown that a vegan diet can help do the following:
Promote weight loss
Reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels
Lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer, such as colon cancer
Manage diabetes by lowering A1C levels
But as Soble would tell any of his patients considering it themselves, going vegan doesn't automatically guarantee good health. "You can be overweight and be a vegan; you can be malnourished and be a vegan," Soble says."
Question:Can vegan diets be healthy?

Evidence:"Hydroquinone is prohibited in cosmetics products, as it is listed in Annex II (entry 1339) of the European Cosmetic Regulation No 1223/2009. As an exception, Hydroquinone is only permitted for professional use in artificial nail systems in a concentration in the final product up to 0.02% (Annex III, entry 14). The European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), concluded in 2015 that, due to safety concerns raised with regard to the life cycle of products containing that substance, the use of Deoxyarbutin up to 3% in face creams cannot be considered as safe. Dihydroxyacetone (DHA, CAS No: 96-26-4) is an aliphatic ketone that is used as a hair dyeing, skin conditioning and tanning agent in cosmetics and personal care products. This ingredient is used in self-tanning cosmetic products in the EU market since the 1960’s. In 2010, the SCCS published an opinion on the use of DHA on cosmetic products and concluded that the use of this substance as a self-tanning ingredient in cosmetic formulations up to 10% and in spray cabins up to 14% would not pose a risk to the health of the consumer."

Evidence:"Older men have a higher risk of having a UTI, especially if they are after the age of 50. Most cases in older men are caused by the bacterium known as Escherichia coli, which is naturally present in the body.Cases similar to UTIs in younger men are typically caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs).A UTI develops when the bacterium gets into the urinary tract through the urethra and starts multiplying.As men have longer urethras than women, they are less prone to UTIs because bacteria need to travel a longer distance to reach the bladder.UTIs are four times more common in women than in men.A person’s risk of developing a UTI increases if they have:diabeteskidney stonesan enlarged prostatean abnormal narrowing of the urethraan inability to voluntarily control urinationan inability to empty the bladder completelynot drunk enough liquidsnot been circumciseda past diagnosis of a UTIurinary tract abnormalities that prevent urine from leaving the body normally or cause urine to back up in the urethrahad anal intercourse, which can expose the urethra to bacteriaa health condition or taking medication that suppresses the immune systemhad a procedure involving instrumentation on the urinary tractExamples of these procedures include the insertion of a tube to drain the bladder, or a small camera, known as a cystoscopy, to examine the bladder and urethra.Can men get UTIs from women?Men can get UTIs from women during sex, by getting the bacteria from a woman with the infection. However, this is unlikely.Typically, the infection arises from bacteria that are already present in the man’s body.DiagnosisShare on PinterestA physician may carry out a urine dipstick test to identify a UTI.A doctor can diagnose a UTI by carrying out a physical examination, taking a medical history, and through laboratory tests.Physical examinationThe doctor may perform a physical examination that includes:checking the vital signschecking the abdomen, bladder area, sides, and back for pain or swellingexamining the genitalsMedical historyThe doctor may ask if the person has had other UTIs in the past, or a family history of UTIs.They may also question the person about their symptoms.Laboratory testsLaboratory tests are required to diagnose the infection as the symptoms of a UTI can be common to other diseases.A urine sample is usually needed to look for the presence of pus and the bacteria causing the infection.Men may be asked to give a urine sample. A man will need to start the urine stream to clean the urethra, and then collect a midstream sample in a cup. As bacteria multiply quickly at room temperature, this urine sample is either sent to the laboratory immediately or kept refrigerated until later.The doctor may also ask for a urine test strip, also known as a urine dipstick test. This is a quick test in which a plastic or paper ribbon is dipped into the urine sample and then removed."

Evidence:"Yes. But eating an excess of them will not actually enhance your night vision. According to the AAO (American Academy of Ophthalmology), which has sponsored and/or promoted many eye health studies designed to dig out the facts from the fiction about this slender orange marvel, the reason why carrots are good for your eyes is because they contain the nutrient vitamin A, which helps protect your eyes. In fact, one cup of sliced, raw carrots will give you more than 110% of your daily value for vitamin A. Photo courtesy of EyeSmart, a website supported by the AAO

Evidence:"However, illegally sold alcoholic drinks sometimes have methanol making up its entire alcohol content! Drinking 10 ml of methanol is enough for its toxic effects to show, while ingesting 30 ml of more is often fatal. Methanol poisoning can lead to severe health effects. Symptoms include slight intoxication (drunkenness) for 10 to 20 hours, followed by weakness, vomiting, pain, confusion, lowering of blood pH, blindness, coma and death1. Methanol vs. Ethanol Toxicity

Evidence:"If you are pregnant, it is acceptable to have an imaging exam when your doctor considers it necessary to determine your future course of medical care. Bear in mind that your health is important to the health of your baby. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures use a “non-ionizing” form of radiation that is very different from x-rays. For this reason, ultrasound is commonly used during pregnancy, with no known cases of harm to an unborn baby from such a procedure. Though not used as often as ultrasound, the same is true of MRI. Radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine imaging exams all use x-rays to produce images."

Evidence:""But until recently, most of us weren't sure just what the connection was. "One way exercise can help lower cholesterol is by helping you lose -- or maintain -- weight. Being overweight tends to increase the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in your blood, the kind of lipoprotein that's been linked to heart disease.Part of the confusion about the effect of exercise on cholesterol stems from the fact that most early cholesterol studies focused on both exercise and dietary changes, making it hard to tease out which of these factors was actually making the difference. But recent studies have more carefully examined the effect of exercise alone, making it easier to evaluate the relationship between exercise and cholesterol. Researchers now believe there are several mechanisms involved. First, exercise stimulates enzymes that help move LDL from the blood (and blood-vessel walls) to the liver."

Evidence:"“Wearing sunglasses year round, especially from a young age, will help protect the eyes from UV exposure that leads to increased risk of developing cataracts later in life.”
Vision loss happens slowlyMost cataracts are found in people over the age of 60, but changes to the eye start happening around the age of 40, and cataracts can occasionally occur in babies or young children. Loss of transparency develops slowly, causing a gradual and painless decrease in vision. In addition to blurriness, changes experienced can include:
Glare, particularly at night
Frequent changes in your vision prescription
A decrease in colour intensity
A yellowing of images
Improved close-up vision for farsighted people, or reduced distance vision for nearsighted people
Risk factors also include some medications (e.g., steroids), systemic diseases such as diabetes, eye injuries, smoking and close family history of cataracts. Treatment and preventionEyeglasses or contact lenses can usually correct slight vision changes caused by early cataracts, but they cannot sharpen vision once a cataract is severe. Once one has developed, there is no cure except to have the cataract surgically removed. Canadians can help protect themselves against cataracts by reducing exposure to ultraviolet light by wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, not smoking, and ensuring regular eye exams with their eye doctor."

Evidence:"Health authorities have educated us that drinking enough water is absolutely vital for our bodies to function properly. And it is—unless you drink too much of it. Though most people look out for the signs of dehydration, experts say overhydration can be equally as dangerous. Drinking too much water generally results in nothing worse than a frequent flier pass to the restroom—but under certain circumstances, it can cause extreme illness and even death, says Austin DeRosa, MD, urologist with UCHealth Cancer Center in Highlands Ranch, Colorado and chair of robotic surgery at the University of Colorado Medicine. Hyponatremia, sometimes called “water intoxication,” causes abnormally low levels of sodium and other electrolytes in your bloodstream, which then can lead to serious health problems such as seizures, coma, and, in rare cases, is fatal, he explains.

Results showed that the effects of statins vary significantly with age. Indeed, individuals over 65 showed an improvement in reaction time whereas individuals under 65 displayed impairment in working memory. The same study has shown both age groups of statin users benefited from statin treatment, but the benefit was stronger in individuals under 65, suggesting that statin therapy in midlife could be more beneficial for cognitive function (Alsehli et al., 2020). The modifying effect of age on the association between statin and AD has been supported by other studies including statin types and sex covariates."

Evidence:"Most processed meats contain pork or beef, but processed meat may also contain other red meats and poultry”Grilling burgers and hot dogsIt’s not yet clear exactly why these meats increase risk for colorectal cancer. It may be the added nitrites and nitrates, the smoking and/or high temperatures used in some processing, or the heme iron in red meat.Does this include nitrate and nitrite free meats and sausage? These products are relatively new, so we need more studies that make these distinctions.So, for now, save processed meats for special occasions and choose fresh meats most of the time. Here are some ideas to lower your cancer risk:Replace deli meats and cold cuts with fresh chicken or fishInstead of bacon, chorizo or salami, try spicy vegetarian sausages.Replace sausage in chili and soups with beans like kidney beans, chickpeas and lentils.Try out different sources of protein like eggs, cottage cheese, tofu and hummusIARC has also listed red meat as a probable carcinogen. AICR’s recommendation for red meat is to keep your red meat to less than 18 ounces (cooked) per week.

Evidence:"In addition to having anti-inflammatory properties, ginger may improve digestion and promote the release of hormones that regulate blood pressure, which can calm the body and reduce nausea. The main bioactive compounds in ginger are gingerol and shogaols, which accelerate gastric emptying and stimulate gastric antral contractions through their activity on cholinergic M receptors and serotonergic 5-HT receptors. Shogaols are more concentrated in dried ginger, with 6-shogaol being its main source of antioxidants, whereas gingerols are more abundant in raw ginger.How much ginger should I take to reduce nausea? According to the FDA, consuming up to 4 grams of ginger per day is safe, although some studies recommend using less (200 to 2,000 mg per day). Most researchers seem to agree that dividing 1,000-1,500 mg into multiple doses is the best way to use ginger for nausea relief."
