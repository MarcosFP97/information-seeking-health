Evidence:"It was determined that vitamin D serum concentrations inversely correlated with the decline in COVID-19 infection risk. The overall treatment elicited by vitamin D serum level interaction was considerable, with a 12% rise in the hazard ratio for each category of serum level. A 25% reduction in COVID-19 risk throughout the spectrum of cumulative dosages and a 27% reduction across average daily dosages were also noted. The cumulative dose-response relationship was inversely related to vitamin D blood concentration. Overall, the study findings showed that vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection and death within 30 days. Therefore, the researchers believe vitamin D3 supplementation could be a valuable strategy for limiting the spread of COVID-19 infection and related death and racial differences in COVID-19 outcomes.Journal reference:

Evidence:"Yes, but for different reasons. Caution: Be careful taking very high doses of vitamin C supplements. They can also cause unwanted side effects such as abdominal cramping and diarrhea. How might IV vitamin C work in COVID-19 patients? There are several theories about how IV vitamin C may help treat COVID-19:
			Very high vitamin C levels may create free radicals that destroy viruses and bacteria. Our body’s cells have defenses against these free radicals, but viruses do not."

        Abstract
      This report provides a perspective on the relevance of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation to the COVID-19 crisis. While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions. We attempt to derive novel insights into their usefulness, both from theoretical and practical standpoints."

Evidence:"Specifically, ginger exhibited a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome [10, 11], the primary cause of mortality in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, bioactive compounds present in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, showed high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus could potentially interfere with the spike protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) interaction [12, 13]. Interactions between ginger-derived compounds and papain-like protease and other virus proteins essential for its survival were also indicated via computational theoretical models [14, 15].Taken together, ginger presents the potential as an alternative therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial to examine the effect of the ginger supplement on the clinical manifestations of individuals with COVID-19.MethodsStudy design and participantsThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, and the trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059824). All participants provided written informed consent. Study participants were recruited among the individuals with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Fangcang shelter hospitals, from April to May 2022, in Shanghai, China."

Evidence:"Although some neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors are being developed, there is uncertainty about their safety and efficacy (8). Therefore, we urgently need to explore new strategies to treat COVID-19. Tea is popular all over the world as a food drink; in fact, tea has been used as an herbal medicine to prevent and treat various diseases (9). Tea and its characteristic polyphenols—catechins—have been shown to be active in preventing obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases (10–12). Tea ingredients have also been shown to have anti-viral activity as well as protective activity against diseases caused by oxidative stress and inflammation; many of these ingredients may help alleviate and treat COVID-19 (13, 14). Although several studies have focused on epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea, which has been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19 (15), we focused on systematic research of the therapeutic potential of tea components for COVID-19, including inhibition of COVID-19 signature gene transcription and direct interactions with specific COVID-19 proteins."

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease."

Evidence:"Lower odds of respiratory symptoms were seen in patients with a flu shot (aOR=0.678, 95% CI [0.492, 0.934], p=0.018), but no difference was found in patients with the pneumococcal vaccine versus those who didn’t have it. Additionally, having the flu shot also led to lower odds of having severe disease (aOR=0.672, 95% CI [0.500, 0.903], p=0.008) and a similar effect was seen with those who had the pneumococcal vaccine (aOR=0.412, 95% CI [0.234, 0.725], p=0.002).The researchers concluded that both the seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine could provide a protective value against symptomatic COVID-19 disease. They urged further study to understand how the influenza and COVID-19 can impact a virus’s epidemiology.Reference1. The Flu vaccination may have a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 in the pediatric population: when does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) meet influenza?."

Evidence:"However, whether sex hormones-dependent modulation of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the lung or other SARS-CoV-2 target tissues correlates with COVID-19 susceptibility or severity needs to be further elucidated.Sex Hormones Control Anti-Viral Immune ResponseGender is a key host factor influencing immune response, leading to differences in severity, prevalence, and pathogenesis of infection, with males generally more susceptible than females (18).According to experimental evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-CoV, another beta-coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, estrogen status is key in determining disease severity through modulation of the immune response. Ovariectomy of SARS-CoV infected female mice or treatment with an ER antagonist increased mortality compared to treatment with tamoxifen (a selective ER modulator) (19). The protective role of ER signalling has been linked to the induction of the “anti-viral status” mediated by type I interferon (IFN-I), a first line cytokine involved in host defence (4). In the SARS-CoV model, reduced survival was due to a robust viral replication and delayed IFN-I signaling which promoted accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, resulting in elevated lung pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysfunctional virus-specific T-cell responses (20). Thus, ER signalling may prime the IFN-I response and prevent viral replication. In contrast, a delayed IFN-I activation would generate a response-lag unable to compensate robust viral replication, thus leading to uncontrolled hyperinflammation."

Evidence:"“I do think the pro-viral activity observed in vitro merits further controlled clinical study.”Nevan Krogan, who led the research and serves as the director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UC San Francisco, agreed.“This is information we wanted to responsibly report but tempered with a strong caveat that these results were seen in the lab (and) more tests are needed, especially in humans, before any definite conclusions are drawn,” Krogan said.Coronavirus: How to know when to go to the emergency roomMarch 27, 202001:37Dextromethorphan's potential to promote the growth of the virus was observed in monkey cells that were in a lab dish. The effects, if they play out clinically, are likely unique to the new coronavirus and have not been known before, Shoichet noted.It’s not a known side effect of dextromethorphan and researchers have no reason to believe it would affect influenza, for example, he added.The study involved more than 120 scientists from the U.S. and Europe who are searching for potential treatments for COVID-19.They created a blueprint of more than 300 human proteins that the virus requires to infect human cells, then looked at which existing drugs — or those in development — might target those proteins, UCSF said in a news release. They found a number with the potential to treat COVID-19.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & WellnessCDC adds 6 new coronavirus symptoms to its listDrugs that showed antiviral activity against the new coronavirus in lab experiments included zotatifin, which is currently in clinical trials for cancer; ternatin-4/plitidepsin, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma; haloperidol, which is used to treat schizophrenia; the antihistamines clemastine and cloperastine; and the female hormone progesterone.A preclinical compound (a drug not yet approved for any condition and for which there's no human clinical data yet) called PB28 had about 20 times greater antiviral activity in lab experiments than hydroxychloroquine, which is being studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19.The researchers caution the promising drugs in the analysis have only been tested against the new coronavirus in lab experiments so human clinical trials would be needed to make sure they’re safe and effective. Until then, the authors don’t advocate anyone prescribing or using the drugs to treat COVID-19.The study “will help to focus clinical trials toward the most promising agents” to combat the virus, Krogan said in a statement.A.

Evidence:"Readers of this article have different views about the importance of vinegar on Covid-19. Mohammad Hussain, one of the readers, wrote that apple cider vinegar is really effective in treating coronavirus. Another person named Mujtaba wrote: “Apple cider vinegar works like a miracle on coronavirus.”
According to him, he and his mother contracted the virus, but by drinking apple cider vinegar and water they recovered. In a video clip posted on a Youtube page named “Aparat”, a person says that his mother contracted the virus and was being cared at home. He added that he had heard that apple cider vinegar was useful. “We mixed two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with four tablespoons of water and steamed it, inhaled it two to three times a day, and two weeks later we recovered from the virus,” he explained."

Evidence:"We identified only one randomised clinical trial that compared lopinavir–ritonavir with usual care in patients with COVID-19. This trial assigned 99 patients who had been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to a lopinavir–ritonavir group (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and 100 patients to a standard-care group, and found no difference in viral clearance, time to clinical improvement, or 28-day mortality between the two groups. However, the trial was underpowered to exclude clinically relevant treatment effects.Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, the randomised evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is the first large-scale randomised clinical trial to report the effects of lopinavir–ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We found no significant difference between the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the usual care group in terms of 28-day mortality, the probability of discharge alive within 28 days, or, among patients who were not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, the probability of progressing to the composite outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. We saw no evidence of benefit of lopinavir–ritonavir in any patient subgroup.Implications of all the available evidenceOur finding of no clinical benefit from lopinavir–ritonavir treatment compared with standard care supports earlier findings from a smaller clinical trial. Many clinical care guidelines have recommended lopinavir–ritonavir for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19."

Evidence:"With regard to the work ahead, a suitably designed case series or randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be advisable to further establish its efficacy for high-risk COVID-19 patients.Related worksThere is emerging evidence that Ayurvedic treatment methodologies and herbal medicines may be effective in combating COVID-19. Girijaa and Sivan [18] describe one of the first case reports of a patient with COVID-19 treated entirely with Ayurveda. In a study using molecular dynamics simulations, Kumar et al. [19] report that withaferin A (Wi-A) and withanone (Wi-N), derived from a common Ayurvedic herb called Ashwagandha, may block the entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells. Several herbs including Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) and Haldi (Curcuma longa—turmeric) used as Ayurvedic medicines are well known for their immunomodulatory properties [20,21,22,23,24]. Ayurvedic treatment has also been found to be effective in other COVID-like illnesses such as influenza [25,26,27] and chikungunya [28]."

UVC radiation may also be effective in inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the virus that causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For more information see "Q: Where can I read more about UV radiation and disinfection?". However, currently there is limited published data about the wavelength, dose, and duration of UVC radiation required to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition to understanding whether UVC radiation is effective at inactivating a particular virus, there are also limitations to how effective UVC radiation can be at inactivating viruses, generally. Direct exposure: UVC radiation can only inactivate a virus if the virus is directly exposed to the radiation."

Evidence:"Novel formulations of TQ nanoparticles may, however, be required to overcome the poor bioavailability and the pharmacokinetic limitation of this compound in terms of clinical use. Conclusion
This article examined the concept that certain natural compounds may target the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19, as well as potentially assisting with overcoming the diverse health complications associated with the repeated use or withdrawal of conventional therapeutics. TQ, the main active ingredient of Black seed oil, is an easy, cost-effective natural source of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune stimulant, antibacterial, anticoagulant, and antiviral properties. TQ use may thus be expected to improve COVID-19 comorbidities and to protect against certain antiviral drug-induced side effects and toxicities. TQ appears to be a promising therapeutic option for managing COVID-19 and its complications, and clinical trials in COVID-19 patients to examine the beneficial effects of TQ are thus highly recommended.

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called "Tamiflu approach" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston. "One of the real things for controlling the pandemic is making sure that drugs can get to the people who need them," Butterton told MedPage Today. "An oral drug for COVID-19 would be something that people could take quickly."

Evidence:"Animal studies showed anti-cancer activity from nimbolide. For instance, nimbolide isolated from Neem at 5 and 20 mg/kg significantly reduced the growth of colorectal cancer xenografts in mice. Xenografts are tissues that are transplanted from one species to another. Moreover, a significant decreased in tumorigenic protein, such as those related to proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, were also reported in the mice xenograft treated with nimbolide [39].An ethosomal formulation with soy lecithin (300 mg), ethanol (35%), luliconazole (100 mg) and Neem extract was more effective against Candida parapsilosis than Aspergillus niger in fungal culture tubes. In the same study, the in vitro drug permeation test with Wistar albino rat skin model demonstrated the release of 83.45 ± 2.51% in 24 h. Thus, luliconazole and Neem extract showed synergistic effects against fungal infections [40].Interestingly, A. indica was reported as a nutritional strategy for psoriasis in a recent study since it is rich in nimbidin. A significant reduction in the PASI (psoriasis area and severity index) score was observed after 12 weeks of consuming three capsules/day of A. indica in an RCT (randomized controlled trial) of 50 patients."

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 
Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs."

Treating with Remdesivir immediately after diagnosis of COVID-19 reduces the risk of hospitalization and death in vulnerable patients with severe disease by 87%
The international study will be presented at the IDWeek international conference and includes the participation of 562 unvaccinated people
An international study with the participation of the Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, IrsiCaixa and the Infectious Diseases Service of the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital has shown that intravenous administration of the antiviral drug Remdesivir during the 3 days right after diagnosis of COVID-19 reduces the risk of hospitalization by 87% in people susceptible to severe disease. Administration of this drug has also decreased the number of disease-related medical visits by 81% (see table). Disease-related adverse events have been reduced from 7.1% in patients who did not receive treatment to 3.6% in patients who did receive the antiviral drug. A total of 562 unvaccinated individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 for different reasons, such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, participated in the study."

Although metabolic conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes have been linked to an increased risk of COVID-19, as well as an increased risk of experiencing serious symptoms once infected, the impact of diet on these risks is unknown. In a recent study led by researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and published in Gut, people whose diets were based on healthy plant-based foods had lower risks on both counts. The beneficial effects of diet on COVID-19 risk seemed especially relevant in individuals living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation."

Evidence:"His team reported that flu vaccines were associated with a reduced risk of death in people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil2.“This is an important piece of evidence,” says Mihai Netea, an infectious-disease specialist at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The observation that influenza vaccines are linked to a reduction in not just SARS-CoV-2 infections, but also disease severity, strongly suggests that the protection is genuine, he adds.Time limitHow long this protection lasts is unclear. Among those in the Qatar study who had the flu jab and later contracted COVID-19, Abu-Raddad’s team recorded SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring, on average, about six weeks after vaccination. “I don’t expect to see this effect lasting long at all,” he says. Netea guesses that the benefits last for between six months and two years.It’s not fully clear why flu vaccines — which are composed of killed influenza viruses — would also protect against COVID-19. Vaccines train the immune system to recognize specific pathogens, but they also rev up broad-acting antiviral defences, says Netea, who has found signs of such responses in flu-vaccine recipients3.Netea’s team is also working to better quantify the benefits of vaccines targeting influenza and other diseases against COVID-19."

Evidence:"[23] Some researchers hypothesized that for the differences in severity of COVID-19, the impact of ACEI/ARBs use on patients were differ. A referral center cohort study in Northeast of France enrolled 149 patients with severe COVID-19 showed that there was a deleterious effect of long-term therapy with ACEI/ARBs among patients with severe COVID-19 with regard to their risk of developing acute kidney injury and acute respiratory failure. [24] However, Yang et al. [25] found that the ACEI/ARBs treatment could result in a marginally lower death rate and less critical cases in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, which supported the use of ACEI/ARBs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. In addition, Di et al. [26] found that there was no association between the use of ACEI/ARBs and COVID-19 severity or in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients."

Evidence:"Yet these risks are relative, meaning people with type O blood are not immune to COVID-19. "We do know that people of all types can get infected with COVID-19," says cardiologist Daniel Anderson, MD, PhD. Your blood type may also affect how severe the progression of COVID-19 will be. "Some evidence shows the severity of the infection is associated with different blood cell types, but the mechanisms by which it happens are unclear," says Dr. Anderson. Blood type is not the only factor in disease severity. How much virus you were exposed to, your age, plus any of your underlying health conditions also affects the course and severity of the disease."

Evidence:"global healthinfectious diseases, viralpoisoning, mass incidentspoisoningtoxicologyDear editorMethanol ingestion can be a highly lethal poisoning; methanol is metabolised to formaldehyde and formic acid, which are extremely toxic to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract leading to a triad of visual impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms and metabolic acidosis in 6–24 hours.1Haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic necrosis of basal ganglia, white matter necrosis, and diffuse brain oedema may result in a grave prognosis.2 3 Although alcohol consumption is illegal in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as many other Islamic countries based on religious reasons, there have been sporadic reports of alcohol poisoning, usually in the form of methanol intoxication, mostly found in illegally produced alcoholic beverages. Previous outbreaks of methanol poisoning in Iran in 2007, 2013 and 2018, resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.2–4 The most recent outbreak, and perhaps the most significant, coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. Our records show a dramatic increase in cases of methanol intoxication in March and April 2020; as of 16 April 2020, there have been 797 cases of methanol poisoning with 97 deaths in the Fars province, Iran, reported by the Head of Emergency Medical Service of the Fars province.5 These numbers, from a single province, supersede the previous largest report from the whole country (768 intoxicated subjects) in 2018,4 and there are similar reports of methanol poisonings in several other centres throughout the country during this period.Unlike prior outbreaks, the current outbreak of methanol poisoning appears to be due to the belief that consumption of disinfectants and sanitizers, specifically, alcohol, would be beneficial in preventing the COVID-19 infection. This is supported by several cases of methanol poisoning in children resulting from a desperate attempt by parents to prevent or cure the infection. When facing a serious health threat, refractory to the available remedies, such irrational decision making is anticipated, leading to quack cures and dubious prophylactic measures.6 Appropriate public education is mandatory to fight the misinformation that is being spread through social media about the alcohol and other similar disinfecting agents. This is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality and also to protect an already exhausted healthcare system from excess burden during a devastating pandemic.References↵

Evidence:"Due to the harmfulness of cigarettes, a high frequency of smokers is suspected among people suffering from COVID-19. However, some studies report that the number of current smokers hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than expected, considering the prevalence of smoking in individual countries. Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm. Conclusions:
      There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking. Both the relationship between cigarettes and the morbidity and severity of COVID-19, as well as the possibility of using nicotine in the treatment of the disease, require further analysis."

Evidence:"Therefore, we were unable to factor in substance use disorder into our inverse probability weighting process.ConclusionsIn this retrospective review of 1831 COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission, current cannabis use was associated with decreased disease severity. This was demonstrated in lower NIH severity scores as well as less need for oxygen supplementation, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. While there was a trend toward improved survival in cannabis users, this was not statistically significant. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking at clinical outcomes of cannabis users hospitalized with COVID-19. Further studies, including prospective analyses, will help to better understand the relationship between cannabis and COVID-19 outcomes. Availability of data and materials

Evidence:"In the 5 days following randomization, 13 patients (5.9% of 221 patients with QTc assessed) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 7 patients (3.3% of 214 patients with QTc assessed) in the placebo group had a recorded QTc interval greater than 500 ms. A total of 30 serious adverse events were reported, including 18 serious adverse events from 14 patients (5.8%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 12 serious adverse events from 11 patients (4.6%) in the placebo group. Discussion
In this multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 34 US hospitals, treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not improve or worsen clinical outcomes for adults hospitalized for respiratory illness from COVID-19. These findings were consistent in all subgroups and for all outcomes evaluated, including an ordinal scale of clinical status, mortality, organ failures, duration of oxygen use, and hospital length of stay. Enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine as a potential therapy for COVID-19 was sparked by in vitro studies that suggested it limited entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells by inhibiting glycosylation of cell receptors targeted by coronaviruses and increasing endosomal pH, thereby reducing endosome-mediated viral entry.6-8 Additionally, hydroxychloroquine reduces the production of several proinflammatory cytokines involved in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a severe manifestation of COVID-19.3-5 These factors, combined with broad availability, oral administration, and perceived safety based on historical use in the treatment of malaria and rheumatologic diseases,4 led to widespread clinical use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.10,15 On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19,29 which was later revoked on June 15, 2020.30 
The finding of this clinical trial that hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious for the treatment of COVID-19 is consistent with results from recent in vitro studies suggesting no antiviral activity for hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-231,32 and open-label pragmatic trials in the United Kingdom33 and Brazil34 suggesting no clinical benefit. Interpreted along with these prior studies, the results of this trial provide strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not beneficial for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Strengths of this trial included its blinded, placebo-controlled design, high adherence to the study protocol, rigorous monitoring for safety events and adverse events, and rapid recruitment from geographically diverse hospitals serving ethnically and racially diverse populations within the US."

Evidence:"Based on the FDA’s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that bebtelovimab may be effective in treating certain patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. When used to treat COVID-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits of these antibodies outweigh the known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to bebtelovimab. The EUA for bebtelovimab is supported by clinical and nonclinical data. The clinical data are from a phase 2, randomized, single-dose clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of bebtelovimab alone and bebtelovimab combined with other monoclonal antibodies for treating mild to moderate COVID-19. What you need to know:
Bebtelovimab works by binding to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, similar to other monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized for the treatment of high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and shown a benefit in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death."

In this post, we explain how you can use liquid household bleach to disinfect hard surfaces. As we work together to combat the novel coronavirus that causes the disease commonly known as COVID-19, it’s essential to know how to create and use effective cleaning solutions. In this post, we explain how you can use liquid household bleach to disinfect hard surfaces. What is household bleach? Liquid household bleach is a chemical used frequently in laundering white clothing and disinfecting hard surfaces."

Evidence:"BackgroundIn contrast to other respiratory viruses, children have been less affected by COVID-19 than adults. Furthermore, for reasons that remain elusive, the vast majority of reported infections in children are mild or asymptomatic [1, 2]. Recent reviews have proposed a wide range of mechanisms for this difference, including factors such as concurrent infections, differences in microbiota, anti-oxidative properties, or protective effects of global active viral immunization of children from birth till 6 years [3].However, as far as we know, the role of pre-exposure to mother’s milk as a protective factor against COVID-19 has not been critically reviewed. Human milk contains an array of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compounds that confer long-term benefits against infections years after lactation is terminated [4]. Since it is acknowledged that severe COVID-19 is associated with uncontrolled inflammation, and more recently research has focused on host iron dysregulation [5], breastfeeding may have a protective role to play. It has been reported worldwide that children who were ever breastfed show lower blood levels of both ferritin [6] and biomarkers that are severely increased during the cytokine burst (i.e., serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or uric acid) than their formula fed peers [7,8,9]."

COVID-19 Vaccination Questions
Q: Who is eligible to receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine? A: ACIP recommends that all people age 5 years and older who have completed primary vaccination against COVID-19 with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) should receive at least one age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine booster dose at the appropriate interval. Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine primary series recipients are not yet recommended to receive a booster dose and the Novavax vaccine is not yet authorized for use as a booster dose for individuals who received a different primary series vaccine. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be used when booster doses are indicated in almost all circumstances."

Are inhaled corticosteroids an effective treatment for people with mild COVID-19? Key messages
Inhaled corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medicines) given via the oral inhaled route are evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We identified three published studies for people with mild disease. Inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of people going to hospital or death (admission to hospital or death before hospital admission). Inhaled corticosteroids may lower the number of days people have symptoms of mild COVID-19 and probably increase resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. They may make little to no difference in death from any cause, and we do not have enough evidence to know whether they cause serious harms.There are no data for people with COVID-19 with no symptoms (asymptomatic) or people with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.We found 10 ongoing and four completed unpublished studies."

Evidence:"Medical News Today spoke with experts to find if mosquitoes could also carry and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.Share on PinterestExperts weigh in on whether or not mosquitoes can carry and spread SARS-CoV-2. Image credit: Rob and Julia Campbell/Stocksy,Zika, dengue, and West Nile are viruses that spread through bites by infected mosquitoes. Because a number of viruses can be transmitted through mosquito bites, people may wonder if the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 can also circulate this way. Medical News Today spoke to a variety of experts to find out if mosquitoes can transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And if they do not now, is there potential for them to do so in the future? All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication."

Evidence:"Ribavirin (Fig. 1), one of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs used for the last four decades against RNA viruses, could be a potential candidate to be used for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Ribavirin (1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), which was first synthesized in 1972 (Witkowski et al. 1972), has broad-spectrum antiviral properties and has been used mostly to treat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in humans. Although ribavirin is used almost exclusively in hepatitis C virus infections in clinical practice, it has an antiviral effect against different viruses (Ramírez-Olivencia et al. 2019)."

Yes

Evidence:"Activation of the ECS during COVID-19 progression could be a new way to combat systemic inflammation and the cytokine storm. The goal of this review, which was carried out by a group of researchers from a variety of multi-national institutions, was to find clinical studies evaluating coronavirus infections in the context of Echinacea administration and to assess preventive and therapy advantages. The study
The initial clinical study was conducted as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, monocentric randomized control trial (RCT) at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom. Participants aged 18 and above from Cardiff, Wales, were asked to apply a 3 x 0.9 mL solution daily for four months. A commercial preparation, standardized to contain 5 mg/100 g of dodecatetraenoic acid isobutylamide based on high-performance liquid chromatography measurements, was used to extract the hydro-ethanolic extract from freshly harvested aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea to 95% supplemented with 5% Echinacea purpurea roots extract.

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy
