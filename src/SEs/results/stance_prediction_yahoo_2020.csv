UPDATED January 2022: While this study and others have linked vitamin D levels to immune function, it is important to note that vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to be preventive of or a treatment for COVID-19. Vaccinations and public health measures such as masking and distancing are the best tools for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A new research study at the University of Chicago Medicine has found that when it comes to COVID-19, having vitamin D levels above those traditionally considered sufficient may lower the risk of infection, especially for Black people. The study, published in JAMA Open Network on March 19, retrospectively examined the relationship between vitamin D levels and likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. While levels of 30 ng/ml or more are usually considered sufficient, the authors found that Black individuals who had levels of 30 to 40 ng/ml had a 2.64 times higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than people with levels of 40 ng/ml or greater. Statistically significant associations of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 risk were not found in white people.",lower the risk of infection,neutral,"

Gussler said needs can vary from 1,00 IUs to 50,000 IUs.Should I take zinc?“Research is really supporting that zinc supplementation does reduce the severity, the frequency and the duration of the common cold,” Gussler said. “Obviously the research isn’t quite out there on COVID but we can extrapolate that it does have a lot of immune benefits.”If you’re sick, you may notice a boost of zinc can help you feel better. Both zinc and vitamin D are the main ingredients in many over-the-counter cold medicines.If you’re not sick, Gussler recommends only taking zinc through a multi-vitamin, typically not large amounts by itself.“Zinc and copper compete for the same receptor site in the body,"" Gussler said. “So, if you do a lot of zinc and not supplementing copper and making sure you’re getting enough copper, you can actually create a copper deficiency which can cause anemia for some people.”There are some zinc tablets that also contain copper, which you can ask your doctor if that’s a good option for you.The foods which contain Zinc also contain copper, which naturally helps to balance each other: Meat, shellfish, chickpeas, lentils, beans, nuts and seeds.Isn’t vitamin D deficiency common in the US?It sure is!Vitamin D deficiency is particularly common among Hispanic and black people, two groups who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, according to the Mayo Clinic.Vitamin D deficiency is also more common in people who are older, and those who are obese or have high blood pressure.",vitamin D and zinc do to fight COVID-19,neutral,"

There is also some evidence that it may help protect against viral respiratory infections and play a regulatory role in the body’s immune response. This has led to a proposal that taking vitamin D supplements could help prevent or even treat COVID-19, the primarily respiratory disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2.While no clinical trials have tested the vitamin’s efficacy as a treatment or a preventive measure, several studies have found an association between low levels of vitamin D and COVID-19. However, a review of five of these studies by the U.K.’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which compiles guidelines on best practices, concludes that the studies provide no evidence that vitamin D levels influence the risk of getting COVID-19 or dying as a result.None of the five studies had been designed to investigate the effects of the supplements on the risk of the infection or as a treatment for the disease, the authors point out. Either investigation would have required an intervention study, such as a randomized controlled trial. The existing studies, therefore, provide no insights into the vitamin’s efficacy, appropriate doses, or possible adverse effects as a means of treating or preventing COVID-19.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Confounding factorsMoreover, only one study in the review accounted for confounding factors, which may provide alternative explanations for the observed associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19.Higher body mass index (BMI), older age, and socioeconomic deprivation, for example, are all factors that could affect both the risk of COVID-19 and levels of the vitamin.",taking vitamin D supplements could help prevent or even treat COVID-19,neutral,"

Can vitamin D cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34638897/," Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, can lead to multiorgan damage. Due to the extremely contagious and fatal nature of the virus, it has been a priority of medical research to find effective means of treatment. Amid this search, the role of vitamin D in modulating various aspects of the innate and adaptive immune system has been discussed. This review aims to consolidate the research surrounding the role of vitamin D in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. While there are some conflicting results reported, the consensus is that vitamin D has a host of immunomodulatory effects which may be beneficial in the context of COVID-19 and that low levels of vitamin D can result in dysfunction of crucial antimicrobial effects, potentially contributing to poor prognosis. Studies also show that the effects of low vitamin D can be mitigated via supplementation, although the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of COVID-19 remain controversial.",supplementation,neutral,"

Can vitamin D cure COVID-19?,https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q4/researchers-study-the-link-between-vitamin-d-and-inflammation.html," They found that in the lung cells of people with COVID, part of the immune response was going into overdrive, exacerbating lung inflammation. “In normal infections, Th1 cells, a subset of T cells, go through a pro-inflammatory phase,” Kazemian said. “The pro-inflammatory phase clears the infection, and then the system shuts down and goes to anti-inflammatory phase. Vitamin D helps to speed up this transition from pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory phase of the T cells. We don’t know definitively, but theorize the vitamin could potentially help patients with severe inflammation caused by Th1 cells.”
In patients with COVID-19, the pro-inflammatory phase of the Th1 cells seems not switched off, possibly because the patients didn’t have enough vitamin D in their system or because something about the cell’s response to vitamin D was abnormal. In that case, the researchers posit, adding vitamin D to existing treatments in the form of a prescribed highly concentrated intravenous metabolite may further help people recovery from COVID infections, though they have not tested this theory.",We don’t know definitively,neutral,"

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/vitamin-protect-you-covid-19-coronavirus-disease-3534829/," One of the biggest problems with vitamin C studies is that most do not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Supplementation is unlikely to show an effect in people whose vitamin C levels are already high. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about it. But several studies in other infections or conditions suggest it may be beneficial in certain groups of people, particularly those already deficient in vitamin C who develop COVID-19. Currently, at least two trials are underway specifically investigating the use of vitamin C to treat severe COVID-19, one in New York and one in China. Beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation have been reported for

Elderly people with acute respiratory infections

Though high dose IV vitamin C is currently being tested to see if it can improve lung function in people with COVID-19, no evidence suggests that high doses of oral vitamin C supplements can help with the disease. In fact, they can cause complications like diarrhea (2).SummaryHigh dose IV vitamin C has been used in China to help improve lung function in people with COVID-19. However, vitamin C’s effectiveness is still being tested. There’s no evidence to support the use of oral vitamin C supplements for COVID-19.Do you need to supplement?Currently, no evidence supports the use of oral vitamin C supplements to prevent COVID-19.Vitamin C may help shorten the duration and severity of colds caused by other viruses, but this is no guarantee that it will have the same effect on the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Additionally, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin.

Vitamin C is one of the nutrients of interest in COVID-19 cure and prevention. Vitamin C may have a number of immune-modulatory mechanisms that can help to mitigate or reduce COVID-19 pathophysiology (4, 5, 9–11). Vitamin C may act as an antioxidant (9–11). Vitamin C supplementation is thought to help reduce oxidative damage and thus prevent worsening internal vascular endothelial injury (4).

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-supplements-vitamins-what-we-know," One review from Chinese researchers, published in February in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked at what is already known about vitamin C and other supplements that might have a role in COVID-19 treatment. Among other encouraging signs, human studies find a lower incidence of pneumonia among people taking vitamin C, “suggesting that vitamin C might prevent the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions.”
But for preventing colds, a 2013 Cochrane review of 29 studies didn’t support the idea that vitamin C supplements could help in the general population. However, the authors wrote, given that vitamin C is cheap and safe, “it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial.”
What we know about Vitamin C and COVID-19: About a dozen studies are under way or planned to examine whether vitamin C added to coronavirus treatment helps with symptoms or survival, including Thomas’ study at the Cleveland Clinic. In a review published online in July in Nutrition, researchers from KU Leuven in Belgium concluded that the vitamin may help prevent infection and tamp down the dangerous inflammatory reaction that can cause severe symptoms, based on what is known about how the nutrient works in the body. Melissa Badowski, a pharmacist who specializes in viral infections at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, and colleague Sarah Michienzi published an extensive look at all supplements that might be useful in the coronavirus epidemic.

Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection. I have written before that using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up. Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health.",unlikely,neutral,"

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.medpagetoday.com/casestudies/infectiousdisease/87976," Although the data on vitamin C are mixed, a recent meta-analysis suggests that in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS, vitamin C lessens both the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay. In a recent randomized clinical tri­al of 167 patients with sepsis and ARDS, treatment with high-dose intravenous vitamin C up to 15 g per day was associated with a significant reduction in 28-day mortality and a shortened duration of ICU stay. These data may have contributed to the recent increase in use of vitamin C in the treatment of COVID-19 disease, the case authors note. For instance, a phase II trial has been initiated at Wuhan University in China to study the efficacy of vitamin C infusion in the treatment of ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2. The case authors also pointed to a study of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the Seattle region that found a median ICU stay of 14 days and duration of mechanical ventilation of 10 days, whereas the patient in the case report had a 6-day ICU stay and 5 days of mechanical ventilation. According to a 2017 review of vitamin C and immune function, epidemiological studies have indicated that hypovitaminosis C (i.e., plasma vitamin C less than 23 mmol/L) is relatively common in Western populations, and vitamin C deficiency (less than 11 mmol/L) is the fourth leading nutrient deficiency in the U.S.",lessens both the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay,neutral,"

Can the BCG vaccine protect against COVID-19? While researchers racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the potential of the BCG vaccine – used to prevent TB – to slow the pandemic has been hotly debated.

Almost 100 years old, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine protects against some of the deadliest forms of tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that was responsible for 1.5 million deaths globally in 2018 alone. The BCG vaccine was first given to humans in the early 1920s, but its use didn’t become widespread for decades, following continued research into its safety and effectiveness in the 1940s and 1950s.",it’s too early to draw conclusions,neutral,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34742127/," A higher mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was reported in countries where BCG vaccination is not routinely administered, when compared to the vaccinated ones. We hypothesized that BCG vaccine may control SARS-CoV2 infection via modulating the monocyte immune response. We analyzed GSE104149 dataset to investigate whether human monocytes of BCG-vaccinated individuals acquire resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentially expressed genes obtained from the dataset were used to determine enriched pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions for monocytes post BCG vaccination. Our data show that BCG vaccine promotes a more effective immune response of monocytes against SARS-CoV2, but probably not sufficient to prevent the infection. Keywords:

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Study to Help Prevent COVID-19





Home
COVID-19











SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a contagious virus affecting everyone. Researchers at Texas A&M University, in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College Medicine and Cedars Sinai Medical Center, are looking for health care workers, first responders, front line workers, seniors and those with preexisting health conditions to participate in a study evaluating the Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a booster of the immune response and to study if this vaccine reduces illness severity from coronavirus. The study will also examine if BGC will improve efficacy of recent vaccines.The goal of this trial is to learn if a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, a nearly 100-year-old commonly used tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, can help prevent COVID-19 infection and/or mitigate the severity of the illness compared to a placebo. Vaccine Trial Eligibility and Consent

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tuberculosis-vaccine-may-help-protect-against-covid-19," Unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity rarely targets specific pathogens that the body has encountered in the past.Researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA, wondered whether BCG might reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.“We were interested in studying the BCG vaccine because it has long been known to have a general protective effect against a range of bacterial and viral diseases other than TB, including neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections,” says co-senior author Dr. Moshe Arditi, director of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division at Cedars-Sinai.The team has reported their results online in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.COVID-19 symptoms and antibodiesBetween May 11 and June 18, 2020, 6,201 healthcare workers gave blood samples and answered questions about their medical history, including whether they had received BCG and vaccines against two other bacterial infections and influenza.In total, 1,836 said they had received the BCG vaccination, 4,275 said they had not received it, and 90 were unsure.Those with the vaccination were less likely to report experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 at any time in the past 6 months.Overall, 3.5% of the entire cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among those who reported receiving the BCG vaccine, 2.7% tested positive, while among those who said they hadn’t received it, 3.8% tested positive.“It appears that BCG-vaccinated individuals either may have been less sick and therefore produced fewer anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or they may have mounted a more efficient cellular immune response against the virus,” says Dr. Arditi.After adjusting for age and sex, BCG vaccination — but none of the other vaccinations — was still associated with a reduced likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.In their paper, the researchers write:“Taken together, these results indicate that a history of BCG vaccination confers a nonspecific protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2 and decreases the presence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms. This appears to be specific to BCG, as [other vaccinations] […] are not associated with similar protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2.”Self-reported vaccination historyOne of the study’s limitations was that it relied on participants’ recollection of which vaccines they had received, and whether they had experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms in the previous 6 months.In addition, the numbers in each group who developed symptoms or tested positive were relatively small, which limited the statistical power of the study and the reliability of its findings.However, it is interesting to note that those who reported receiving the BCG vaccination were older on average. They were also more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.These are all factors that increase a person’s chances of developing a severe COVID-19 infection.In August 2020, Medical News Today reported another observational study, which suggested countries with mandatory BCG vaccination had a degree of “herd immunity” against the disease.There are 22 clinical trials currently investigating BCG’s potential to prevent or treat COVID-19, which should provide more definitive evidence. Dr. Arditi and Cedars-Sinai are involved in one of the studies.No-one believes BCG will be more effective than specific vaccines for COVID-19, Dr. Arditi explains. But if the trials prove its worth, as a well-established vaccine, BCG could be quickly approved and rolled out for this application.",reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

Scientists around the world are racing to find ways out of the new coronavirus pandemic. Some are working to develop new drugs and vaccines, while others are looking to see whether therapies we already have may help against COVID-19.In the latter category, researchers have dusted off one intriguing compound in our collective medicine cabinet — a century-old vaccine to fight tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. A couple of early analyses, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that countries that require this vaccine, called Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), seemed to have been hit less severely, in terms of both number and severity, by the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.Could this vaccine be protecting people from COVID-19?

Cedars-Sinai Research Raises Possibility That a Century-Old Vaccine May Be Useful Against Coronavirus



A widely used tuberculosis vaccine is associated with reduced likelihood of contracting COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new study by Cedars-Sinai. The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease.The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.In the new study, published online Nov. 19 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, investigators tested the blood of more than 6,000 healthcare workers in the Cedars-Sinai Health System for evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and also asked them about their medical and vaccination histories.They found that workers who had received BCG vaccinations in the past—nearly 30% of those studied—were significantly less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood or to report having had infections with coronavirus or coronavirus-associated symptoms over the prior six months than those who had not received BCG. These effects were not related to whether workers had received meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations.The reasons for the lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the BCG group were not clear, according to Moshe Arditi, MD, director of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study.",reduce severity of the disease,neutral,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mandatory-bcg-vaccination-may-slow-spread-of-covid-19," However, the latest findings add to evidence that widespread BCG vaccination of adults and children could protect populations from future COVID-19 outbreaks.In Australia, a clinical trial is underway to find out whether the vaccine protects medical staff in hospitals from the infection that causes this disease.Assuming that trials like this prove the vaccine’s safety and efficacy against COVID-19, the question remains whether vaccination of the wider population should be compulsory. The authors of the new study note that individuals may be tempted to “free ride” and not get vaccinated if they believe that they will be protected through herd immunity.In the absence of compulsory vaccination, they write, achieving herd immunity will depend on enough individuals choosing to get vaccinated for the wider public good.Open questionsThe authors emphasize that several other uncertainties remain. It is unclear, for example, whether BCG vaccination protects adults against COVID-19, and if so, how long the protection lasts. In addition, scientists have yet to investigate whether BCG might have adverse effects on someone who already has the infection responsible for COVID-19.Finally, even among countries with mandatory BCG vaccination, the new research found large variations in the rates of COVID-19 spread. “Hence, BCG is by no means a magic bullet that assures safety against COVID-19,” the researchers write. “In all likelihood, there are some societal variables that moderate this effect.",widespread BCG vaccination of adults and children could protect populations,neutral,"

But we don’t know if ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels in humans, and if so, to what extent it may boost susceptibility to COVID-19, Kutti-Sridharan told Healthline.Anton Pottegård, PhD, an author, pharmacoepidemiologist, and clinical pharmacist at the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues, said he would like to see more research to replicate his findings.“However, considering the fairly hypothetical grounds on which the initial concern was raised, I would argue that we at the present time have limited reason to provide specific guidance for ibuprofen use specifically in relation to COVID-19,” Pottegård told Healthline.Is ibuprofen okay in people with COVID-19?Because this is a cohort study, its design could be vulnerable to biases including sampling, ascertainment, and observer bias. The gold standard is usually a randomized control trial, Poterucha said.“Much more study is needed to definitively understand adverse effects of NSAIDs and morbidity of COVID-19 ahead,” Poterucha said.There were more than 9,000 people to draw data from in this study, along with a matched cohort, so the research does show valuable information, said Dr. Rodney E. Rohde, an associate dean for research at Texas State University’s College of Health Professions focusing on public health microbiology.“However, I would continue to want to see more, larger studies looking across a strong sampling of demographics of populations before drawing any final conclusions,” he told Healthline.“There is not sufficient evidence to recommend those who take ibuprofen for other indications to stop or change ibuprofen to a different anti-inflammatory medication because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Kutti-Sridharan said.That said, it doesn’t mean that it’s entirely safe to take ibuprofen over the counter to manage fever or pain due to COVID-19.COVID-19 isn’t just a respiratory illness but a multi-system disease that can seriously affect the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart, along with many other organs.“Given its potential for renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular side effects, ibuprofen use, if indicated, should be restricted to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period, preferably under a doctor’s guidance to avoid serious adverse outcomes,” he added.Share this articleBy the Healthline Editorial Team on September 14, 2020 — Fact checked by Michael CrescioneRead this nextEverything You Should Know About the 2019 Coronavirus and COVID-19Get the facts about the 2019 coronavirus (and COVID-19).

Research in this area is developing fast, but with so much misinformation about COVID-19 and ibuprofen use, the cautious approach is to avoid ibuprofen with COVID-19 if at all possible – especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. Anyone who thinks they might have COVID-19 can consider using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen for managing their fever, unless they’re told otherwise by their doctor or pharmacist. In the meantime, the UK’s Committee of Human Medicines and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have been asked to review all the evidence to understand ibuprofen’s impact on COVID-19 symptoms. Naturally, people already prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug for a health condition should ask their doctor’s opinion and not just stop their medication. Paracetamol can also treat fever, as well as aches and pains.",make COVID-19 symptoms worse,neutral,"

When the health minister of France, Olivier Veran, put out a bold proclamation that certain painkillers could worsen COVID-19, it took off. We’re talking about common over-the-counter painkillers, like ibuprofen and aspirin (known as NSAIDs or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which also reduce fever.

Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.sciencealert.com/ibuprofen-and-covid-19-symptoms-here-s-what-you-need-to-know," Having fever is also uncomfortable because it often comes with shivering, headaches, nausea and stomach upsets. Taking an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or paracetamol will bring down a high temperature by lowering some of the fever molecules.However, doctors who compared the two in 2013 suggested taking paracetamol over ibuprofen for normal chest infections because they found a small number of people's illness got worse with ibuprofen.Cause for concern?Some of the reasons that there's a concern taking ibuprofen will make COVID-19 symptoms worse comes from previous studies that have shown people with other serious chest infections (such as pneumonia) experienced worse symptoms and prolonged illness after taking an NSAID, including ibuprofen. But it's difficult to say if taking ibuprofen in these instances directly causes worse symptoms and prolonged illness, or if it's because ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories help manage pain, which may hide how serious the illness is and could stop people from asking for help earlier – delaying treatment.Or, it might be to do with ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory effects. One theory is that anti-inflammatory medicines can interfere with some of the body's immune response, although this is not proven for ibuprofen.However, two French studies warn doctors and pharmacists not to give NSAIDs when they see signs of chest infections, and that NSAIDs shouldn't be given when children are infected with viruses.There's no agreement on why ibuprofen could make chest infections worse, but both studies reported worse outcomes in patients who had taken a NSAID to treat their condition. A recent letter to The Lancet suggested that ibuprofen's harm in COVID-19 is to do with its effect on an enzyme in the body called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – though this has yet to be proven. This caused additional worries for patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for existing heart conditions.Several leading organisations have rightly warned patients not to stop taking their regular medicines in light of unconfirmed theories.Because novel coronavirus is a new type of virus, there is currently no evidence proving that taking ibuprofen will be harmful or make COVID-19 symptoms worse.",taking ibuprofen will make COVID-19 symptoms worse,yes,"

A study published in The Lancet in April added to initial concerns of taking ibuprofen with COVID-19. Researchers suggested that people taking certain medications for conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 if they additionally took ibuprofen.﻿﻿ The reason? These medications in question—ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), or thiazolidinediones—increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the body, and ibuprofen can make that expression even stronger. SARS-CoV-2 enters the body by binding to that enzyme receptor.﻿﻿

If you have a fever, take paracetamol. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice. ""ALSO SEE: What are the coronavirus symptoms and when should I see a doctor?The French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health also issued an alert saying that ""grave adverse effects"" linked to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (a family of drugs that includes ibuprofen) have ""been identified with patients affected by COVID-19, in potential or confirmed cases.Story continues""We repeat that the treatment of a fever or of pain linked to COVID-19 or to any other respiratory viral disease should be paracetamol,"" the government’s urgent notice said.Veran’s warning followed the recent publication of a study in the Lancet medical journal that hypothesized that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.While advising people with COVID-19 avoid ibuprofen, WHO stated that health experts are still looking into the matter to provide “further guidance.”B.C.",could worsen COVID-19,neutral,"

      This report provides a perspective on the relevance of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation to the COVID-19 crisis. While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions.

Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/scientists-test-if-gargling-salt-water-helps-treat-coronavirus/," A team at the University of Edinburgh previously discovered that using saline solutions noticeably reduced common colds by two or more days. They are now starting fresh tests to see if it does the same for COVID-19, and are recruiting volunteers for the trial dubbed COVID-19 ELVIS, for Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study. “As COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus we do not know if nasal washout and gargling salty water will have the same effect as previously seen in other strains,” the Scottish team said. The study hopes to see if it will “reduce the duration of symptoms and transmission to others in the same household.”
The team’s previous study, published last year, suggested that using salt water reduced common colds by an average of two-and-a-half days. It suggests that certain human cells were able to use chloride ions — a component of sea salt — to create hypochlorous acid, which is the active ingredient in bleach and has antiviral properties. Researchers want to test people as soon as they fall sick, only requesting people showing any of the key symptoms in the last 48 hours.",we do not know if nasal washout,neutral,"

It’s crucial for our nervous system to function, our muscles to contract and relax, and for maintaining fluid balance. However, the amount that we need is actually very small: less than a quarter of a teaspoon a day.Almost all of us consume more than that, and exceeding 6g (a teaspoon) per day could be harmful if you’re at risk of, or have, high blood pressure.

No, gargling with salt in warm water won’t kill this coronavirus and keep you safe. That one’s been all over social media — and was popular during the spread of SARS and MERS and Zika virus, too. A warm salt water gargle can reduce pain from a sore throat, but there’s no expected benefit in terms of curing COVID-19, a respiratory infection. Even with a sore throat, don’t swallow salt water.

The TrialDubbed as the COVID-19 ELVIS, scientists are now recruiting volunteers for this trial. The trial is for the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study.It aims to study if the process of gargling salty water will reduce the duration of the symptoms or if it would prevent the transmission of the virus to other people in the same household. “As COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus we do not know if nasal washout and gargling salty water will have the same effect as previously seen in other strains,"" a representative of the Scottish team stated.Previous StudyA study previously conducted by the team, published in 2019, strongly suggested that symptoms of a common cold may be reduced by two and a half days with the help of salt and water. The rationale behind it is that there are human cells that utilize one component of sea salt, which is chloride ions, in order to create hypochlorous acid.

While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions.

Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.As scientists around the world race toward finding an effective treatment and cure for COVID-19, health officials in China have started encouraging an alternative type of medicine to help those who get sick with the respiratory infection — traditional herbal remedies.Using herbs for illness isn’t a novel idea. For thousands of years, herbs like licorice, ginger, and ephedra have been used to treat respiratory infections like the flu and pneumonia.Some remedies, like forsythia, were put to the test for SARS and found to be somewhat effective in laboratory studies.Anecdotally, people have claimed herbal medicines have kept them healthy or improved their symptoms, but the bulk of research on herbs is inconclusive. Health experts warn that we don’t have enough data to support the use of herbal remedies for COVID-19.Though we may eventually find that certain herbs may be beneficial for the coronavirus, the science is scarce and now is not the time to start experimenting with herbal remedies on your own if you contract COVID-19.“Everything has to be taken with an understanding that we don’t have any data with the coronavirus,” Dr. Felicia Gersh, the founder and director of the Integrative Medical Group of Irvine in Irvine, California, told Healthline. “Who knows what the future may bring.”Herbs may help with other virusesHerbal remedies have long been used to treat infections and viruses, such as the common cold, influenza, fever, and even herpes.

Tavel recommends taking Cold-Eeze lozenges, an OTC medication containing zinc gluconate, several times a day for upper respiratory symptoms.“Since there is little harm in such a strategy, it may be worth a try,” he said.Vitamin C“It supports the activity of our immune cells, especially when they work more than they should during outbreaks,” said Asli Elif Tanugur Samanci, a food scientist and chief executive officer of Bee & You. “I would recommend 1 to 3 grams a day, on top of a healthy diet that’s rich in fresh vegetables and fruit.”Herbal remedies like turmeric and ginger“They both have incredible anti-inflammatory properties and also very high in antioxidants,” said Samanci.“Further, ginger is full of chemicals that fight off cold and relieves stomach-related problems. Turmeric also has hundreds of active chemicals and is a great pain reliever,” Samanci said. “You can either add them fresh or juice them to get the full spectrum of benefits.”A thermometerIf you suspect you have a mild case of COVID-19, you’ll need a thermometer to check your temperature twice a day, since being fever-free is one of the requirements for ending self-quarantine.If your symptoms get worse, call a healthcare professional.Household cleaning and sanitizing productsGloves, soap, hand sanitizer, surface-cleaning products, mops, and sponges will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your household.Extra sheets, towels, and pajamas“When you are sick, you can contaminate all the surfaces you come into contact with,” said Peters.",using zinc lozenges,no,"

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/ginger-root-and-meteorite-dust-the-steiner-covid-cures-offered-in-germany," It is a country whose physicist chancellor told parliament she passionately believes “there are scientific findings that are real and should be followed.”But Germany is also a country where some people who fall severely ill with Covid-19 can find themselves taken to hospitals where they are treated, under sedation and without a formalised opt-in procedure, with ginger-soaked chest compresses and homeopathic pellets containing highly diluted particles of iron supposedly harvested from shooting stars that have landed on earth.Followers of the “spiritual scientist” and self-proclaimed clairvoyant Rudolf Steiner advocate such therapies to fight the coronavirus because of a supposed “anxiety-relieving effect on the soul and the body” and ability to “strengthen the inner relationship to light”.There are no peer-reviewed studies or clinical trials proving the effectiveness of these remedies, and they are not included in the official treatment guidelines issued by Germany’s leading intensive care associations.Yet in Germany some of these therapies have been given to critically ill patients throughout the pandemic at Steiner hospitals such as Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Havelhöhe, one of a network of 16 clinics in Berlin offering intensive care to Covid-19 patients under the oversight of the prestigious Charité university hospital.Followers of Steiner have joined anti-vaxxers and the far right on demonstrations against Covid restrictions, such as this one in Berlin in August. Photograph: Action Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe country’s public health insurance companies, which are part-financed by German taxpayers, have duly picked up the tab via flat-rate payments for hospital treatment of coronavirus patients.However, public acceptance of the movement and its philosophies is facing renewed scrutiny after a year in which Germans have seen followers of the Steiner philosophy march alongside anti-vaxxers and the far right in protest at the government’s measures against coronavirus.Best known outside Germany for the left-leaning schools focused on self-directed play with wooden toys, Steinerism started out as a multi-disciplinary spiritualist philosophy in the late 19th century.Born in 1861 as a citizen of the Austrian empire, Steiner claimed to have access to higher spiritual planes that gave him insights into reincarnation, links between cosmic bodies and plant growth, and evolutionary history, including the years of Jesus’s life not covered by the Bible and the sunken continent of Atlantis.By the time of his death in 1925, Steiner had applied his philosophy to a wide array of subjects, including education, architecture, agriculture, dance and medicine.In the 21st century, anthroposophy remains a minority movement, albeit one that enjoys a high level of social acceptance and institutional support in German-speaking countries. In Germany, there are more than 200 schools, more than 500 nurseries and 263 institutions for people with mental disabilities that follow Steiner’s philosophy. The country’s highest grossing drugstore chain, dm-drogerie markt, and second-largest chain of organic supermarkets, Alnatura, are both run by self-professed anthroposophists, and cosmetic products made by Steiner-devoted brands like Weleda and Dr Hauschka are not only for sale in German pharmacies but are also enjoying a global boom.While the number of employees working at these institutions and businesses who take Steiner’s philosophy at face value is likely to be low and dwindling, the movement has carved out a steady presence in German public life.“In some ways anthroposophy is a German success story”, said Helmut Zander, a historian of religion who has written books critical of the Steiner movement. “It hits a nerve that our society has for a long time ignored. Organic farming has gone mainstream over the last decade – Steinerists have done it since the 1960s.”Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) claimed insights into everything from reincarnation to Atlantis.",ginger-soaked chest compresses,neutral,"

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://guardian.ng/features/etatuvie-ginger-garlic-others-can-fight-covid-19-symptoms/," Therefore, from a scientific point of view, definitely ginger, garlic and many other medicinal plants have the capacity to manage and take care of the associated symptoms of most viral infections, including, influenza and HIV/AIDS. One major thing is that most viral infections attack the immune system, of which these plants have the properties that could boost the immune system. I think it is not really far from the truth to say that you can use extracts of ginger, garlic and many other medicinal plants to take care of the associated symptoms of viral infections, including COVID-19. If you look carefully, you will find out that COVID-19 symptoms are almost similar to other viral infections – cough, difficulty in breathing, difficulty in smelling and pains. What level of research has NNMDA done to ensure that we have a local cure for COVID-19?

So whereas it is a good habit to take them regularly to help with improving immunity, please couple that with handwashing; sanitizing; keeping social distance and wearing of masks.— Dr. Patrick Amoth, EBS (@DrPatrickAmoth) August 8, 2020 According to The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's article, ""Consuming ginger—whether by eating ginger root, drinking ginger tea, taking ginger capsules, or sniffing or adding ginger powder to your food—will not prevent or fight a coronavirus infection. Viral infections spread in your body when the virus enters your cells and makes copies of itself and then those copies enter new cells and repeat the process. Ginger will not destroy the virus in your body or stop the copying process.

But he is not alone, Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau also told the nation that he has been taking the concoction to help him with boosting his immunity.Speaking during one of the press briefings last week, MOH acting director doctor Patrick Amoth said the concoction which is - Ginger, lemon, honey and garlic - is not a cure for the disease.“Ginger, lemon and honey are good because they are sources of vitamins and micro-nutrients, but the message to take home today is that there is still no cure for Covid-19. I will not stop you from taking your ginger honey or lemon as many times as you want but for sure it’s not a treatment for Covid-19.” he said.But with the cold season trickling in in many parts of the country, the concoction is the only sure bet that someone can rely on in kicking away the flu.Coronavirus like any other has its symptoms which are -cough, running nose, itchy throat, tiredness among others.The concoction is to majorly relieve a person from the itchy throat, the flu and the runny nose.

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/ginger-root-and-meteorite-dust-the-steiner-covid-cures-offered-in-germany," It is a country whose physicist chancellor told parliament she passionately believes “there are scientific findings that are real and should be followed.”But Germany is also a country where some people who fall severely ill with Covid-19 can find themselves taken to hospitals where they are treated, under sedation and without a formalised opt-in procedure, with ginger-soaked chest compresses and homeopathic pellets containing highly diluted particles of iron supposedly harvested from shooting stars that have landed on earth.Followers of the “spiritual scientist” and self-proclaimed clairvoyant Rudolf Steiner advocate such therapies to fight the coronavirus because of a supposed “anxiety-relieving effect on the soul and the body” and ability to “strengthen the inner relationship to light”.There are no peer-reviewed studies or clinical trials proving the effectiveness of these remedies, and they are not included in the official treatment guidelines issued by Germany’s leading intensive care associations.Yet in Germany some of these therapies have been given to critically ill patients throughout the pandemic at Steiner hospitals such as Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Havelhöhe, one of a network of 16 clinics in Berlin offering intensive care to Covid-19 patients under the oversight of the prestigious Charité university hospital.Followers of Steiner have joined anti-vaxxers and the far right on demonstrations against Covid restrictions, such as this one in Berlin in August. Photograph: Action Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe country’s public health insurance companies, which are part-financed by German taxpayers, have duly picked up the tab via flat-rate payments for hospital treatment of coronavirus patients.However, public acceptance of the movement and its philosophies is facing renewed scrutiny after a year in which Germans have seen followers of the Steiner philosophy march alongside anti-vaxxers and the far right in protest at the government’s measures against coronavirus.Best known outside Germany for the left-leaning schools focused on self-directed play with wooden toys, Steinerism started out as a multi-disciplinary spiritualist philosophy in the late 19th century.Born in 1861 as a citizen of the Austrian empire, Steiner claimed to have access to higher spiritual planes that gave him insights into reincarnation, links between cosmic bodies and plant growth, and evolutionary history, including the years of Jesus’s life not covered by the Bible and the sunken continent of Atlantis.By the time of his death in 1925, Steiner had applied his philosophy to a wide array of subjects, including education, architecture, agriculture, dance and medicine.In the 21st century, anthroposophy remains a minority movement, albeit one that enjoys a high level of social acceptance and institutional support in German-speaking countries. In Germany, there are more than 200 schools, more than 500 nurseries and 263 institutions for people with mental disabilities that follow Steiner’s philosophy. The country’s highest grossing drugstore chain, dm-drogerie markt, and second-largest chain of organic supermarkets, Alnatura, are both run by self-professed anthroposophists, and cosmetic products made by Steiner-devoted brands like Weleda and Dr Hauschka are not only for sale in German pharmacies but are also enjoying a global boom.While the number of employees working at these institutions and businesses who take Steiner’s philosophy at face value is likely to be low and dwindling, the movement has carved out a steady presence in German public life.“In some ways anthroposophy is a German success story”, said Helmut Zander, a historian of religion who has written books critical of the Steiner movement. “It hits a nerve that our society has for a long time ignored. Organic farming has gone mainstream over the last decade – Steinerists have done it since the 1960s.”Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) claimed insights into everything from reincarnation to Atlantis.",ginger-soaked chest compresses,neutral,"

Can 5G antennas cause COVID-19?,https://fortune.com/2020/04/07/5g-coronavirus-health-cancer-radiation-studies-safely-use-cellphone/," Here are answers to some of the top questions people have about wireless technology and safety:
Did 5G cause or help spread the coronavirus? The answer to 5G involvement with the coronavirus is simple and straightforward, according to every scientist and doctor that Fortune spoke with. There simply is no connection between 5G and the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. There is no mechanism by which a wireless technology could cause a virus to mutate into a killer epidemic and no way that wireless airwaves can transmit viruses. It is, as Stephen Powis, medical director for the British National Health Service, says, “complete and utter rubbish.”
Some claimed that 5G wireless may have made people more susceptible to the coronavirus by weakening their immune systems. That theory is “based on nothing,” says Eric van Rongen, a biologist who has been studying the health effects of electromagnetic fields for decades and currently chairs the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, a nonprofit formed in the 1990s to offer scientific advice on the issue to policymakers.",There simply is no connection,no,"

It allows for faster communication by using different frequencies and multiple antennas,” says David Starobinski, a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department. “It is an evolution of communication technology rather than a revolution,” he says. Even though 5G technology isn’t entirely new, there are a few reasons why people might have believed it causes COVID-19. For one, there is very little transparency from researchers in communication technologies that leads to institutional distrust. “I think the belief has something to do with a certain distrust in government and the ability to tie this narrative about 5G technology into conversations around government surveillance,” says Cesare.",people might have believed it causes COVID-19,neutral,"

COVID-19 has a clear cause, a new coronavirus. It is a biological virus and not an electronic one. This virus can spread via person-to-person contact and respiratory droplets. Your cell phone or your laptop is not going to transmit this virus, unless, of course, an infectious person coughs on, sneezes upon, touches, or licks your devices.

Now, there are videos like the following claiming that the metal piece in a surgical mask is a 5G antenna:


Apparently the antenna is in the face mask not to help download cat videos, which is always of utmost importance, but to allow 5G to either track you or make you sick.

PODGORICA, 11 JULY 2021 – Almost one-third of the citizens of Montenegro (31%) believe that 5G technology causes or spreads coronavirus and that this is being kept secret so that the companies dealing with this technology can continue to make a significant profit. This is one of the findings from a March survey on a nationally representative sample conducted by the research agency Ipsos, with the support of the British Embassy in Podgorica and UNICEF. UNICEF's Young Reporters analysed this conspiracy theory in Montenegro to check if there was any truth in it. Their analysis is available on UNICEF Montenegro's website and it shows that the fifth generation of mobile internet does not kill the living world or spread coronavirus. Younger citizens aged 18–44 years, as well as citizens with higher education, believe this conspiracy theory less often.",5G technology does not cause or spread coronavirus,no,"

To prove their theory, the authors compared select studies on the biological effects of wireless communication radiation exposure with studies on COVID-19 disease progression.

""People are much more worried about things [like radiation] that they cannot see,"" said Starobinski. While exposure to high-power radiation can be harmful to health, Starobinski assures that there have been safety guidelines on the radiation from communication technologies and 5G should be safe to use. ""People have been using smartphones for years and we don't see evidence that this radiation has caused noticeable increase in diseases or hospitalizations due to usage,"" he said.

Can herbal tea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/herbal-remedies-covid-19-what-to-know," The bottom lineHealth officials in China are recommending traditional herbal remedies for COVID-19, but many experts warn that we don’t have enough data on COVID-19 to understand how different herbs may affect people’s health. Though herbal remedies may seem harmless, if misused, they could increase a person’s risk for COVID-19. We may find that certain herbs are effective in preventing and treating COVID-19 in some people, but there currently isn’t enough data regarding the use of herbal remedies for the new coronavirus.

Can herbal tea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/green-tea-and-covid," Originating from China, green tea is lauded for many health benefits due to its potential antioxidant, antiviral and immune-boosting properties (1, 2).It’s recently been investigated for a possible role in managing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes illness from COVID-19. You may have heard that drinking green tea prevents or cures the disease.In this article, we explain whether green tea affects COVID-19 and offer some immune-boosting tips.Share on PinterestDylan Leeder/Stocksy UnitedDoes green tea prevent or cure COVID-19?Green tea is rich in health-promoting polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has anti-viral effects against single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like Zika, hepatitis C, influenza (flu), dengue, and others (1, 3, 4, 5).Like these, the SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA virus. Thus, green tea extracts continue to be investigated for their potential role in treating the virus and managing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2).Test-tube research shows that green tea extracts may combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus by damaging the spike protein, preventing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall volume of the virus (3, 4, 5, 6).Treatment of the test tube cells with EGCG was most effective during early stages of infection (3).However, it’s important to understand that drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. Most studies showing an effect used single green tea extracts like EGCG in concentrated amounts much higher than what’s found in the natural tea.Furthermore, EGCG is poorly absorbed when consumed orally from teas (4).Nonetheless, green tea extracts may have potential to be used for natural treatment of COVID-19 after further human research and testing.Remember, the best way to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated, maintaining physical distancing, and washing your hands often. You can learn more about COVID-19 vaccines here.SummaryDrinking green tea cannot prevent, treat, or cure the COVID-19 virus, but concentrated extracts like EGCG may have potential to be used for natural treatment after further human research and testing.Are there benefits to drinking green tea if you have COVID-19?A COVID-19 infection can cause inflammation, which is linked to symptoms like fatigue, muscle pain, and achy joints (7).Green tea may have anti-inflammatory properties. It’s shown to reduce damaging inflammation associated with the COVID-19 virus, potentially easing these symptoms (8).",drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19,neutral,"

Over the Counter: Take tea time seriously during COVID-19 pandemicGary Kracoff and John Walczyk
 |  Daily News CorrespondentsAn estimated 159 million Americans regularly drink tea, and according to the Tea Association, in 2020 we downed more than 3.8 billion gallons of it – primarily iced and black. While that may sound like a lot, when averaged over our population, we lag behind many countries including Turkey, the United Kingdom and China.Part of the reason some cultures around the globe have consumed tea for nearly five millennia has been to take advantage of its health benefits. Fast forward to 2021 and tea’s ability to support our immune system amid the COVID-19 pandemic is as important as ever.Traditional teas like black, green and oolong are full of polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), naturally occurring organic compounds that have a potent antioxidant effect on our bodies and therefore may reduce chances of heart disease and cancer. EGCG and the amino acid L-theanine both pack an immune-boosting punch. To get the most antioxidant bang for your buck, avoid adding milk or cream because their proteins may inhibit some polyphenols.Depending on variety, the amount of time and the temperature in which tea leaves are steeped will impact antioxidant levels. White tea should be steeped longer in hot water while black tea is best steeped for a short amount of time in very hot water.",tea’s ability to support our immune system,neutral,"

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html," If you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of treatments, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to treat the virus, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications. Convalescent Plasma
Some people with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment may benefit from a treatment called convalescent plasma. Your healthcare provider can help decide whether this treatment is right for you. Managing COVID-19 symptoms

Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better.",Your healthcare provider can help decide whether this treatment is right for you,neutral,"

In August, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19. To be eligible to donate convalescent plasma, the donor must have a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19, be symptom free, be at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 lbs. Additional weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger. What is an antibody test and why is it important? An antibody test screens for antibodies in your blood.", be symptom free,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-applications-inds-cber-regulated-products/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma," Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral,"

See how it works








Is convalescent plasma a treatment for COVID-19? Right now, it is not known if convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, there’s some evidence that suggests it can help some patients with COVID-19. While convalescent plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by many people, further investigation is still needed to determine if it can shorten the duration of illness, reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent death associated with COVID-19. Because there isn’t an approved treatment for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment in certain people.",it is not known,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/convalescent-plasma-covid-19-research/index.html," Convalescent plasma is a treatment created out of blood from people who have recovered from an infection such as Covid-19. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing immune cells and  antibodies – proteins the body makes to fight infection. The plasma can be infused into a sick person to help recovery. Since the Victorian era, doctors have used this treatment to fight severe cases of the flu. The treatment has also shown success with two other deadly coronaviruses - MERS and SARS.

On paper, treatment with convalescent plasma makes good sense. The idea is to take blood plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and infuse it into patients with active infections. The antibodies in the donated plasma, in theory, would help fight the virus. Based on that idea, last March Dr. Nicole Bouvier at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York decided to give it a try. She recalls thinking, ""we have this new disease that didn't have any known therapies, and convalescent plasma has been used in new epidemic and pandemic diseases,"" as recently as in an Ebola outbreak in West Africa a few years ago.","On paper, treatment with convalescent plasma makes good sense",neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/using-convalescent-blood-to-treat-covid-19-is-it-possible," This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently.Recently, researchers and healthcare professionals have been looking into the possibility of using this method to treat people with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In the United States, a group of researchers and doctors from 57 institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are investigating and applying convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.This is a concerted initiative — called the “National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project” — born after the publication of a viewpoint paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation in March, 2020.The paper argued for the potential merits of passive antibody therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. It was authored by immunologists Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.To understand more about convalescent plasma therapy, its merits, its risks, and its current use in COVID-19 treatments, Medical News Today recently spoke to Dr. Casadevall.Here is what he told us, alongside more information on the current state of convalescent plasma therapy.A therapy ‘used for over 100 years’So, where did the idea of using convalescent plasma, or passive antibody therapy, come from?This notion was first introduced in the late 19th century when physiologist Emil von Behring and bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburou discovered that they could use antibodies present in serum — another blood component — to fight the bacterial infection diptheria.Since then, doctors have used passive antibody therapy, on and off, at least since the 1930s to treat or prevent both bacterial and viral infections, including forms of pneumonia, meningitis, and measles.When we asked him how the idea of using convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 came about, Dr. Casadevall told us: “I have worked on antibodies my entire life professional life […], and I knew that convalescent plasma — or sera […] — was being used for over 100 years.”“In fact, the first Nobel Prize was given [to Behring] for the use of serum to treat diphtheria, so I knew the history.” This long history of successfully using this method against different infectious diseases suggested that it might also be effective against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.“I knew that in epidemics when you don’t have a lot of things, […] the blood of those who recover can have antibodies that can be used [as treatment],” Dr. Casadevall explained.“So it’s an old idea, it’s been around for a long time, and I think that my contribution was, in fact, to alert my friends, authorities, that this [therapy] could be used in this epidemic.”Recent research has already shown that people who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 have developed antibodies that can react to the coronavirus.“There [are] now multiple studies that have shown that when people recover from the virus, they have in their blood neutralizing antibodies that are able to kill the virus,” Dr. Casadevall also told MNT.Although “[p]eople differ greatly in the amount of antibodies that they make — some make large amounts, some make small amounts — […] the good news is that most have [them],” he added.Given the willingness of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate blood, the method seems feasible right now. In fact, some doctors are already using convalescent plasma therapy in some cases.Settling the matter of safetyIn the U.S., the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project have already been trialing this method as widely as possible.Dr. Casadevall told MNT that “in the United States, we have close to 12,000” people who have received the convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19.Based on the data obtained from a little less than half of this cohort, Dr. Casadevall and his colleagues have concluded that this approach is safe for the patients receiving treatment — the first step necessary before ascertaining the method’s effectiveness.The team has reported these findings in a preprint that they have made available online.“[On May 14], we put out a paper on the first 5,000 [patients] showing that [this therapy] was relatively safe. That’s the first step,” Dr. Casadevall explained.“You want to show safety. And then the question of efficacy will be coming in the next few weeks.",This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-shows-no-significant-benefit-convalescent-plasma-covid-19-outpatients-early-symptoms," Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to allow use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Researchers wanted to know whether administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial in persons who were recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, but who were not severely ill and could be treated as outpatients. The objective was to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 illness. The C3PO trial, launched in August 2020, was designed to answer that question. The randomized, controlled clinical trial involved adult outpatients who presented to emergency departments with mild COVID-19 symptoms during their first week post-infection. The trial was conducted by the SIREN clinical trials network, and enrolled more than 500 participants from 48 emergency departments across the United States.",administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.uab.edu/reporter/patient-care/advances/item/9237-new-studies-test-convalescent-plasma-as-covid-19-treatment-and-prevention," The president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Thomas File Jr., M.D., noted in a statement that “while the data to date show some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with COVID-19, especially if given early in the trajectory of the disease, we lack the randomized, controlled-trial data we need to better understand its utility in COVID-19 treatment.”
Existing studies have not had a control group, making it impossible to statistically demonstrate that patients who received convalescent plasma treatment fared better than those who did not. Furthermore, convalescent plasma has only been used in hospitalized patients, Heath said, and studies to date suggest that earlier use in the course of disease may be more beneficial. The two new studies are enrolling non-hospitalized patients at UAB to address these knowledge gaps, Heath said. So what’s the latest on convalescent plasma, who is eligible for the new trials and who can donate? Heath answered our questions.

   What Other Studies Showed  

Research on convalescent plasma use in COVID patients has produced mixed results. In August, the Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Outpatients found that convalescent plasma was not effective against COVID-19 when it was given to patients within the first week after their symptoms appeared. NIH Says No Benefit of Convalescent Plasma as COVID-19 Treatment



In early December, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against using convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19, except in clinical trials. Likewise, the use of convalescent plasma is not allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for outpatient use except, again, in clinical trials. At the webinar announcing the study’s results, Gebo said that the collection of convalescent plasma could be done on a larger scale if its use were to be approved.",convalescent plasma was not effective,no,"

See how it works








Is convalescent plasma a treatment for COVID-19? Right now, it is not known if convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, there’s some evidence that suggests it can help some patients with COVID-19. While convalescent plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by many people, further investigation is still needed to determine if it can shorten the duration of illness, reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent death associated with COVID-19. Because there isn’t an approved treatment for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment in certain people.",it is not known,neutral,"

Can pneumococcal vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20211222/Importance-of-pneumococcal-vaccination-during-the-COVID-19-pandemic.aspx," Given these findings, pneumococcal vaccination is more important than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, the authors have presented positive reports of pneumococcal immunization in COVID-19 individuals with underlying medical problems. Despite the fact that the WHO has stated that bacterial vaccination does not protect against COVID-19 pneumonia, the authors have demonstrated that there is a correlation between pneumococcal disease and COVID-19 in terms of preventing increased morbidity and mortality from secondary infections and superinfections. The authors discussed why pneumococcal vaccination is important in the current pandemic context to improve the global health system in the fight against COVID-19. This study backs up the recommendation for pneumococcal disease immunization and the COVID-19 pandemic relief that comes with it. Journal reference:

This new Kaiser Permanente study provides evidence that these bacterial-viral interactions may play out in ways that shape the course of COVID-19. While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing COVID-19, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine. In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection. This study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1 to July 22, 2020.

Expert opinion Some vaccines are being considered for their potentially beneficial role in preventing or improving the prognosis of COVID-19: influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines. These vaccines may have either direct effect on COVID-19 via different types of immune responses or indirect effects by reducing the burden of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases on individual patients and national healthcare system and by facilitating differential diagnoses with other viral/bacterial respiratory disease. On the other hand, a large number of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in the pipeline and undergoing phase I, II, and III clinical studies.

Are influenza and pneumococcal vaccines more than one-hit wonders? The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines have also shown potential protective effects against COVID-19. For example:

When looking at the CAS Content Collection, more than 50 percent of the documents exploring a connection between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine suggested vaccination had a positive effect (Figure 1)
Research exposing human immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 found an improved cytokine response if the immune cells came from a vaccinated individual. A possible mechanism is that the vaccine acts as a non-specific immune stimulator which works as a kind of early warning system leading to activation of the immune system in general, meaning it is ready when exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Can pneumococcal vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/other-vaccines-covid19," Initial results for the BCG vaccine in playing a cross protective role look promising and a further understanding of the underlying mechanisms could support the use of BCG as a broad-spectrum protector. Are influenza and pneumococcal vaccines more than one-hit wonders? The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines have also shown potential protective effects against COVID-19. For example:
One study has shown that if a population had a 10% increase in influenza vaccination, there was a 28% reduction in COVID-19 death rate in elderly people
When looking at the CAS Content Collection, more than 50 percent of the documents exploring a connection between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine suggested vaccination had a positive effect (Figure 1)
Research exposing human immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 found an improved cytokine response if the immune cells came from a vaccinated individual. A possible mechanism is that the vaccine acts as a non-specific immune stimulator which works as a kind of early warning system leading to activation of the immune system in general, meaning it is ready when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. However, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines would benefit from further real-world studies to uncover associations with COVID-19 cross protection.",The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines have also shown potential protective effects,neutral,"

Their findings appear in the journal BMJ Open.The study’s senior author, Dr. Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, a clinical research fellow at Umeå University, told Medical News Today: “The results of this particular study showed that postmenopausal women taking estrogen had a lower risk of death from COVID-19 than those who were not taking supplemental estrogen. It’s an intriguing result that definitely warrants further study. For example, earlier research investigating possible treatments for COVID-19 also cited estrogen as a potential therapeutic agent.” A previous study found that females have a lower risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team also found that older females who were taking or had taken hormone therapy were less likely to have the infection than age-matched females who had never taken hormone therapy.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-expert-review-finds-multiple-links-with-hormones," Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Early in the pandemic, it became clear that males are more susceptible than females to severe COVID-19 and have a higher risk of death from the disease.Among the proposed reasons are higher rates of smoking among males and a greater reluctance to wear a mask, but there may be a more fundamental, biological explanation.SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19, exploits two membrane receptors called ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to break into its host cells.Research suggests that androgens — that is, male sex hormones — increase the production of these receptors in the cells that line the airways of the lungs, which may make it easier for the virus to infect lung tissue in males.Other lines of evidence that implicate male sex hormones include the observation that male pattern baldness, which is caused by high circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), is associated with severe COVID-19 in males.Intriguingly, clinical trials suggest that drugs for treating prostate conditions and male hair loss, which reduce the production of DHT or block the hormone’s receptors, may speed the recovery of people with COVID-19.Leading endocrinologists from Spain, Turkey, and Italy have reviewed the latest evidence on male hormones and several other hormone-related risk factors for COVID-19 in a position statement for the European Society of Endocrinology. The statement updates a previous statement that the society published in March 2020, early in the pandemic.The authors write that physicians should exercise caution when prescribing testosterone — in particular, androgen replacement therapy for male hypogonadism in older patients.They also review the evidence and issue advice for a range of other endocrine conditions, including vitamin D insufficiency, diabetes, obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and issues related to the pituitary and thyroid glands.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Low levels of vitamin D“We need to be aware of the endocrine consequences of COVID-19 for patients with a known endocrine condition, such as diabetes, obesity, or adrenal insufficiency, but also for people without a known condition,” says first author Manuel Puig-Domingo, M.D., Ph.D., from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in Spain.“Vitamin D insufficiency, for example, is very common, and the knowledge that this condition has emerged frequently in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact outcomes should not be taken lightly.”Despite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a hormone precursor.After adjusting for known risk factors, low levels of the vitamin are more prevalent in people hospitalized with COVID-19 than in the general population.Some studies have also found that low vitamin D levels are associated with more severe disease and mortality.The authors recommend that healthcare professionals ensure that their patients have adequate vitamin D levels — in particular, older adults with diabetes or obesity. They observe that home confinement during lockdowns, especially for older adults, may have contributed to worsening levels of vitamin D deficiency in some countries.Worse outcomes for people with diabetesThe endocrinologists note that a large body of published evidence suggests that diabetes, poor management of blood glucose, and obesity are strong risk factors for worse outcomes and mortality in COVID-19.“Active vigilance and testing in outpatient endocrine clinics, as well as early hospitalization for COVID-19 is recommended,” they write.They add that treatment with metformin for type 2 diabetes and statins for high cholesterol are associated with less severe disease and lower risk of death, so these should not be stopped upon admission to the hospital.Beta cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin, may be particularly vulnerable to damage by the virus because they express an abundance of ACE2 receptors.This may partly explain new cases of diabetes following severe COVID-19.The experts say:“Mortality in type 1 or type 2 diabetes has consistently increased during the year of pandemic — and evidence is emerging that a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 may exist, both in terms of worsening existing conditions and new onset of diabetes.”Lockdown may contribute to weight gainAlongside diabetes, obesity has emerged as a major risk factor for COVID-19.The authors write in their paper:“Weight management, blood pressure, and blood glucose control have always been important to improve cardiometabolic health and prevent severe health consequences in obesity, but the risk of severe COVID-19 is now another important reason to focus on these issues.”They caution that lockdown measures, by influencing diet, levels of physical activity, stress, and sleep, may lead to weight gain.“Thus, people with obesity should be encouraged to increase physical activity and gain healthy eating habits, develop strategies to reduce stress and optimize sleep during pandemic,” they write.Direct damage to endocrine glandsIn addition to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas, they write that there is evidence that the virus may directly damage the adrenal, pituitary, and thyroid glands.They review the latest evidence and provide clinical advice for the treatment of conditions related to each of these endocrine organs.Finally, the endocrinologists emphasize that clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in patients with stable diabetes and obesity, compared with healthy subjects. They recommend that vaccination should not be handled differently in patients with stable endocrine diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, Addison disease, pituitary adenomas, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and obesity.However, they note that the treatment of patients with conditions such as Addison disease, in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, may require adjustment to address potential side effects of vaccines, such as fever.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.EndocrinologyCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland on May 25, 2021 — Fact checked by Rita Ponce, Ph.D.Latest newsHow urinary tract infections (UTIs) negatively impact women's quality of lifeDementia: Surgically fixing cerebrospinal fluid leaks may reverse symptomsRunning as a form of escapism may lead to dependence, study suggestsResearchers have trained ants to detect cancer in urineAlzheimer's: Can a blood test detect disease 3.5 years before diagnosis?Related CoverageWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?Medically reviewed by Meredith Goodwin, MD, FAAFPThe main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://news.virginia.edu/content/age-gender-and-covid-19-complex-hormone-driven-interplay," Bourne added, “These types of studies point to the future of biomedical research: data-driven discovery across scales from molecules to populations – true multi-scale modeling.”In a nutshell, it’s likely that the apparently protective effects of 17β-estradiol, a naturally occurring, abundant female hormone, relate to a key property of this molecule: it attenuates the so-called “cytokine storm” that’s thought to underlie much of the cellular-scale and organ/tissue-level damage wrought by a SARS-CoV-2 infection, via dysregulation of a patient’s immune response. (SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2,” is the technical term for the virus that causes COVID-19. )Why are men beyond age 50 so much more likely than similarly aged women to suffer from a severe course of COVID-19, including such a greater likelihood of death? Spurred by such questions, and by the possibility of hormone-related therapies, the international research team undertook a detailed examination of electronic health records in light of gender, systematically varying age strata (from 15 years old to age 85-plus), in pre- and post-menopausal patient groups, and in female cohorts that either did or did not use any form of exogenous estrogen-related hormone (e.g., contraception among pre-menopausal adult women, or as part of hormone therapy for post-menopausal cohorts). Hormone therapy was found to have a strong linkage to the severity and fatality of COVID-19 among women over age 50.In terms of new therapeutic avenues, Bourne, Mura and colleagues note that “a chief finding of [our] study is the strong positive effect of ... estradiol hormone therapy on the survival rates of post-menopausal women,” and that “whether it could be an effective therapeutic approach not only for women, but also for men with COVID-19 … is a topic for further research.”The work, published in BMC Medicine, is freely available here.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://nashville.renewmetoday.com/can-higher-estrogen-levels-prevent-covid-death/," The researchers used retroactive data in agency databanks and, therefore, did not have a blood test with estrogen levels for the population studied.Thus, for the study, researchers assumed that women on hormone replacement therapy had increased estrogen hormone levels; women on anti-estrogen treatment had small amounts of estrogen levels, and women who met neither of the criteria had normal estrogen levels.To that point, researchers looked at three groups of women between the ages of 50 and 80 who were diagnosed with COVID-19:Those who had decreased estrogen levels due to endocrine therapy,Those who had higher levels of estrogen due to hormone replacement therapy, andThe control group—women who met neither of these criteria for their age group.During the time studied, 49,853 women in Sweden, in all age groups, were diagnosed with COVID-19.Fourteen thousand six hundred eighty-five (14,685) women were between 50 and 80 years old and included in the study.The study identified an association between estrogen supplementation in postmenopausal women and decreased risk of death from COVID-19.While additional research is needed, this is a strong indication that hormone replacement therapy may protect against an increased risk of death from COVID-19 in postmenopausal women. Exploring Hormone Replacement TherapyDo you have symptoms of low estrogen?Are you wondering if hormone replacement therapy is right for you?When it comes to your sex hormones, the only correct approach is medically reviewed, wholly customized, considering your holistic needs. Bioidentical hormones are molecularly identical to the hormones that are naturally produced by your body and typically custom-made for your individual hormone needs. Our Renew Health and Wellness team works with each patient individually to help them achieve their health and wellness goals.Schedule an appointment today to learn more about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) and whether you’re a candidate. We’re happy to answer all of your questions. We already know that estrogen regulates the menstrual cycle and affects the brain, heart, blood vessels, reproductive development, breasts, hair, skin, urinary tract, vaginal lubrication, and weight gain.In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its death toll of nearly six million worldwide, new studies aim to understand the relationship between estrogen and COVID-19 better.In Association between pharmaceutical modulation of estrogen in postmenopausal women in Sweden and death due to COVID-19: a cohort study, researchers analyzed data from three registries: the Swedish Public Health Agency’s registry of all individuals who tested positive for COVIDStatistic Sweden’s registry, which records socioeconomic variablesand the National Board of Health and Welfare’s registry, which records the cause of deathThe purpose of the study was to determine whether augmenting estrogen decreased the risk of death in postmenopausal women diagnosed with COVID-19.Estrogen therapy is used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes along with other symptoms of menopause.It’s also utilized to protect against medical conditions like heart disease, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis in women who can’t take or aren’t seeing results from bisphosphonates.Additionally, hormone replacement therapy replaces natural hormone production in women with estrogen deficiency and women who’ve experienced early menopause due to natural or surgical causes.",augmenting estrogen decreased the risk of death,neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medpagetoday.com/obgyn/generalobgyn/87333," But theories that female sex hormones may be protective are still possible, as estrogen improves the immune response to infection. Estrogen  --  specifically estradiol, or E2  --  stimulates the humoral response to viral infection, activating higher levels of antibody production, researchers said. Immune cells have estrogen receptors and can respond to estrogen stimulation, which may improve immune response. ""Estrogen is a hormone that has multiple effects on the body,"" said Alison Stopeck, MD, co-investigator of a clinical trial that is treating COVID-19 patients with estrogen at Stony Brook University in New York. Not only does the hormone activate antibody production, she said, but it also prevents the hyper-cytokine release that causes an excessive inflammatory response.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/05/12/gender-coronavirus-female-hormones," (Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images) This article is more than 2 years old.Researchers are now finding more evidence that gender could play a role in who gets sick from the coronavirus. Globally, women who contract COVID-19 have been less likely than men to get really sick or die.This week, researchers in Los Angeles have begun giving male coronavirus patients the hormone progesterone, mainly found in women, to see if that helps them recover.One of the researchers, Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says she began noticing more men than women in the intensive care unit as a result of COVID-19.“The difference is pretty striking,” she says. “There are definitely more men on the ventilators.”Ghandehari believes progesterone might be beneficial because of the hormone’s anti-inflammatory properties, which reduce the inflammatory response of immune cells thus decreasing the “abnormalities” that male coronavirus patients are experiencing.The study is in its infancy stages: 40 men who have tested positive for the coronavirus receive two shots of progesterone for five days.To “really know the results,” Ghandehari says they’ll need to test and evaluate more patients. The research is designed in a randomized format where half receive the hormone treatment and half receive standard care.“The difference is pretty striking. There are definitely more men on the ventilators.” Dr. Sara Ghandehari“The folks that have received the progesterone, they have tolerated [the hormone] really well without any side effects,” she says. “And as far as results go, hopefully soon we'll have more information.”If administered in short-term doses, the potential dangers of giving men a female sex hormone are “very, very low,” she says.","very, very low",neutral,"

The former president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) said that there is no paper yet to suggest the Covid-19 infection or treatment disrupts the oestrogen and progesterone hormones. “But there is a definite hypothesis, which needs to be proved. This infection is giving stress due to which the hormone prolactin is secreted from the pituitary gland. Prolactin, which increases with stress, has the ability to mess up all the hormones. So, it may be an indirect disruption,” she said.Pregnant women, who have higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone, too, have drawn the benefit of an inherent protective shield against Covid-19.",the infection can disturb the hormonal balance in the body of a woman,no,"

But this was awful.”Blomgren said she struggled for almost 2 days with “the worst body aches I’ve had in my life,” along with chills, fever, and exhaustion, while her husband went on with his work and life with just a few chills.Two days later, they were both fine and fully vaccinated.What the Blomgren’s experienced is apparently repeating itself in many homes across the nation. A report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that of the first 13.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses given to Americans, reports of side effects were coming at a higher rate from females.In fact, 79 percent of side effects reported came from women, although only 61 percent of the vaccines were given to women.A common occurrenceThe study results aren’t concerning to infectious disease experts.They point out that a stronger response from women to other vaccinations has been seen for years.The reason?Experts suspect that in women, particularly premenopausal women, the levels of estrogen help activate the immune response to illness and, therefore, to vaccines.Men, on the other hand, have more testosterone, a hormone that can somewhat dampen or slow down the same response.Simply put, women in general have a stronger response to vaccines because their bodies are quicker and stronger when it comes to activating what the vaccine introduces in the body.“Infectious diseases in general are always about the immune response and not the bug,” said Dr. Larry Schlesinger, president and chief executive officer of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio.“In women, there is an exuberant and stronger response [to many vaccines],” he told Healthline. “There’s actually a lot of science behind this.”In the past, Schlesinger said, a stronger response in females has been seen and studied in vaccines for yellow fever, DPT, influenza, and other illnesses.Schlesinger said estrogen encourages the body to produce more T-cells, the reactor cells that protect us, when a vaccine is introduced.Thus, he said, we see the quicker and stronger response many women experience.","estrogen help activate the immune response to illness and, therefore, to vaccines",neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429355/," In fact, sex hormones circulate in men and women at different concentrations.Evidence on EstrogensPresent literature has greatly underlined the data, which suggest a beneficial effect of estrogens and a detrimental one for androgens in COVID-19 patients. This is based on the assumption that estrogens are “female” and androgens are “male” hormones. Indeed, preclinical data on animal models of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, in line with present epidemiological data on COVID-19, showed that female mice have better disease course and lower mortality than males6 and that ovariectomy or tamoxifen were associated with increased mortality.6 This may suggest that estrogens are protective towards coronavirus infection but it should not be forgotten that ovariectomy causes not only estrogen but also androgen deprivation. Moreover, selective estrogen receptor inhibitors (SERMs), such as tamoxifen, have also tissue-specific pro-estrogenic effects and one of the most notorious adverse event with SERMs is venous thromboembolism, a life-threatening event in COVID-19. Hence, the role of sex hormones in COVID-19 is likely to be far more complicate than “estrogens is the good and androgens the bad.”As an effect of estrogen levels, females mount a stronger immune response with higher levels of cytokines and antibodies that provides better protection from pathogens.7 However, in COVID-19, the clinical worsening and life-threatening phase rely right in an exaggerate inflammatory response with the so called “cytokine storm” for which a hyperactive immune system could be even detrimental. In addition, some,8 although not all,9 studies show that estrogens upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that, on one hand, promotes the most favorable effects of renin-angiotensin system but, on the other hand, is the key enzyme that allow SARS-CoV-2 entering the pneumocytes and starting lung tissue damage and subsequent inflammatory events.",females mount a stronger immune response,neutral,"

Until then, the authors don’t advocate anyone prescribing or using the drugs to treat COVID-19.The study “will help to focus clinical trials toward the most promising agents” to combat the virus, Krogan said in a statement.A.

An ingredient found in everyday cold medicine appears to promote infection from the coronavirus, according to a new lab study looking at the impact of over-the-counter and prescription drugs on the coronavirus, led by virus experts at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes. Researchers found that dextromethorphan — found in most over-the-counter cough syrups tablets and gel capsules — caused SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to grow more in a lab setting. The scientists initially said people who have COVID-19 should be cautious about using cold medication that contains the drug until more studies are conducted. “Obviously, if you have COVID-19, you're coughing and you're reaching on the shelf for the cough syrup,” said Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UCSF and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. “We're throwing out a caveat here, at least in the laboratory setting -- in the context of this drug, you actually see increased infection.”

And as doctors treat more patients with the illness, news is spreading of other potentially common symptoms like digestive issues and changes to the sense of smell and taste; however, the main three symptoms still seem to be fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Patients typically show symptoms around 5 days after contact with the virus, but it may take up to two weeks for symptoms to appear. If you have mild symptoms, the first step is to call your doctor and speak with them about how you are feeling, along with your risk factors such as underlying health conditions and potential contact with COVID-19 cases. They may instruct you to simply treat your symptoms as necessary with OTC medications and contact them if your symptoms get worse. If you end up in this position, here are some things to think about when considering OTC treatment options.",symptoms get worse,neutral,"

Reznikov said the data suggest these three antihistamines may work by either disrupting the virus’s interactions with ACE2 or by binding with another protein that may interfere with viral replication. The protein, known as a sigma receptor, is part of a cell’s communications network. Reznikov approached Ostrov in March with a hypothesis and an idea: Drugs that bind ACE2 could change disease outcomes, so she asked Ostrov to develop a list of small-molecule drug candidates. She then pursued a strategy to screen the drugs against virus isolates of SARS-CoV-2 with Michael Norris, Ph.D., an assistant research professor of medical geography in the department of geography and the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute.

“It can be problematic if you are reinfected,” Dr. Rouhbakhsh said. “We know from a pretty elegant study that was recently published in Nature Medicine that each subsequent COVID infection will increase your risk of developing chronic health issues like diabetes, kidney disease, organ failure and even mental health problems.”
Such evidence “dispels the myth that repeated brushes with the virus are mild and you don’t have to worry about it,” he added, noting that “it is akin to playing Russian roulette.”
That is why “you want to try to avoid reinfection if possible. That should not be the mechanism by which you aspire to get immunity from the virus,” Dr. Rouhbakhsh said. New COVID-19 variants play a role

“The virus is constantly changing, similar to what the flu viruses do and similar to all the things that give us our typical colds. They adapt, they have new variants that emerge, and these can cause reinfection,” said Dr. Rouhbakhsh. “Omicron has really been an efficient spreader of disease with its subvariants becoming particularly good at evading what protection we already have from previous infection or vaccines.”

During the pandemic, we've learned that certain people are at a higher risk of serious health complications from COVID-19. This risk may be increased in people who are older, pregnant, and recently pregnant, as well as people with pre-existing medical conditions. These groups of people are more likely to be hospitalized, need intensive care, require a ventilator to help them breathe, or suffer fatal consequences if they have contracted COVID-19. The pre-existing medical conditions have fluctuated as researchers have learned more about the effects of COVID-19 on different groups of people. In a study published in August 2021 in the journal BMC, researchers conducted an umbrella review of global data to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with pre-existing health conditions. The study identified heart failure, obesity, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, active and hematological cancer, and history of organ transplantation as being associated with an increased risk of poor COVID-19-related outcomes such as hospitalization, need for intensive care, and death.",pre-existing medical conditions,neutral,"

Americans are increasingly adopting the use of cloth face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19, and the latest science may convince even more to do so. In an editorial published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), CDC reviewed the latest science and affirms that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 that could reduce the spread of the disease, particularly when used universally within communities. There is increasing evidence that cloth face coverings help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. “We are not defenseless against COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R.

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/covid-19-coronavirus-sars-cov-2/face-masks-covid-19-coronavirus," While face coverings primarily prevent the wearer from spreading the disease, they also can protect the wearer from others.Two lines of evidence support the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing the spread of COVID-19:Epidemiological data demonstrate a decrease in COVID-19 growth rates following mandates to wear face coverings in multiple U.S. states, with similar results found internationally.Laboratory experiments visualizing respiratory droplets during various activities provide a qualitative illustration that face coverings reduce the emission of particles by the person wearing the covering. These experiments do not provide information on the usefulness of these coverings as personal protection, since the particles that would be inhaled by the wearer from inside the covering cannot be observed.What type of face coverings are the most effective?Filtering masks, such as N95 respirators, are the most effective at filtering out particles in the air while also restricting the number of droplets spread by an individual.KN95 respirators are similar to N95 respirators, except they are developed to meet Chinese standards, which differ slightly from U.S. standards. Surgical masks follow next in terms of effectiveness.Face coverings made from other materials vary in efficacy, depending on characteristics such as the type of material used, the number of layers present, and fit. Face coverings should completely cover the wearer's nose and mouth. Those with one-way valves do not provide community protection, since the valve opens to allow easy escape of exhaled breath and any particles that it contains.Caltech's Richard Flagan, the Irma and Ross McCollum-William H. Corcoran Professor of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Science and Engineering, is applying his expertise in aerosols to inform studies of the release of virus particles into the air. He also is analyzing the effectiveness of different mask materials.Based on preliminary studies, Dr. Flagan notes the following:The fit of the mask is important.",face coverings primarily prevent the wearer from spreading the disease,neutral,"

""Those not wearing masks can transmit Covid-19 to them, and they can, in turn, transmit to others,"" Healton said.A mask should still provide some protection in an unmasked setting, assuming it's well fitted and worn correctly, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.

Do you feel a lot of air escaping the top or sides? Your mask may be too small or too large or not be a great fit,” advised Carney.Carney noted that mask wearing is also important for children.“The CDC and major health organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend universal masking (students, teachers, staff, visitors) in schools, as children under age 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines at a time when the Delta variant is widely circulating,” said Carney.“I think that the best masks are the ones kids will wear. And kids must be able to wear them for the entire school day indoors, from bus ride to school and then on the bus back home again,” she added.A combination of defenses is best Lipps and Carney agree that vaccination is still the best defense against COVID-19.“Most communities have convenient locations for people not yet able to get their shots,” said Carney.“Not surprisingly, it makes sense that when everyone masks indoors, everyone is more protected. A combination of evidence-based prevention approaches — vaccinations, indoor masking, physical distancing, and good handwashing hygiene — will help us live our lives as fully and safely as possible in the weeks and months ahead,” said Carney.How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Current VersionSep 29, 2021Written ByAnn PietrangeloEdited ByDavid MillsFact Checked ByMichael CrescioneCopy Edited BySiobhan DeRemerShare this articleBy Ann Pietrangelo on September 28, 2021 — Fact checked by Michael CrescioneRead this nextSchools with Mask Mandates Had Fewer COVID-19 OutbreaksA new CDC study finds that schools without masking requirements experience significantly greater cases of COVID-19 in students.READ MOREHow California Has Achieved the Lowest COVID-19 Transmission Rate During the Delta SurgeExperts say California's high vaccination is the main reason for its low COVID-19 transmission rate.

That's why public health officials are warning people to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another, even if they are wearing masks. In other words, homemade masks are likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. ""There's been enough research done to be able to confidently say that masks wouldn't be able to stop the spread of infection, that they would only have a small effect on transmission,"" Cowling said.

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/covid-19-coronavirus-sars-cov-2/face-masks-covid-19-coronavirus," While face coverings primarily prevent the wearer from spreading the disease, they also can protect the wearer from others.Two lines of evidence support the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing the spread of COVID-19:Epidemiological data demonstrate a decrease in COVID-19 growth rates following mandates to wear face coverings in multiple U.S. states, with similar results found internationally.Laboratory experiments visualizing respiratory droplets during various activities provide a qualitative illustration that face coverings reduce the emission of particles by the person wearing the covering. These experiments do not provide information on the usefulness of these coverings as personal protection, since the particles that would be inhaled by the wearer from inside the covering cannot be observed.What type of face coverings are the most effective?Filtering masks, such as N95 respirators, are the most effective at filtering out particles in the air while also restricting the number of droplets spread by an individual.KN95 respirators are similar to N95 respirators, except they are developed to meet Chinese standards, which differ slightly from U.S. standards. Surgical masks follow next in terms of effectiveness.Face coverings made from other materials vary in efficacy, depending on characteristics such as the type of material used, the number of layers present, and fit. Face coverings should completely cover the wearer's nose and mouth. Those with one-way valves do not provide community protection, since the valve opens to allow easy escape of exhaled breath and any particles that it contains.Caltech's Richard Flagan, the Irma and Ross McCollum-William H. Corcoran Professor of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Science and Engineering, is applying his expertise in aerosols to inform studies of the release of virus particles into the air. He also is analyzing the effectiveness of different mask materials.Based on preliminary studies, Dr. Flagan notes the following:The fit of the mask is important.",face coverings primarily prevent the wearer from spreading the disease,neutral,"

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-might-face-masks-reduce-covid-19-severity," Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Researchers have found that wearing a mask increases the humidity of the air a person breathes in.They suggest this may explain why mask-wearing has links with reduced COVID-19 severity.The research, which appears in the Biophysical Journal, adds further evidence for the value of wearing masks.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Do masks reduce COVID-19 severity?Face masks have been a crucial non-pharmaceutical intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers believe they reduce the chances of a person passing the virus to another person, as well as acquiring the virus themselves.Further, while healthcare professionals continue administering effective vaccines around the world, mask-wearing is still necessary.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) point out there is not yet enough information on how these vaccines work in the real-world to recommend people stop wearing masks, even for those who have received two doses of the vaccines.Recent research, which appears in the Journal of General Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine, found that face masks effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and may also reduce its severity.The researchers behind the articles suggest this is due to mask-wearers likely having exposure to reduced amounts of the virus. However, other scientists have contested this finding.The researchers behind the present study are also skeptical that exposure to a small amount of the virus may account for a mask-wearer to have a less severe case of COVID-19.Instead, they suggest the answer may lie in the humidity of the air that a person breathes while wearing a mask.Humidity and disease severityThe researchers note that respiratory viruses, such as the common cold and influenza, often follow a seasonal pattern, with an increase in cases during the winter months. Some evidence also suggests this holds true with COVID-19.Many factors may account for this, such as:people spending more time indoors, where aerosols containing the virus can build uppeople with a vitamin D deficiencylower general levels of ultraviolet light, which may inactivate the virusthe virus being able to last longer in colder, less humid airThe researchers also point out that cold, less humid air can affect the physiology of the organism a virus might infect, inducing more severe infections. For example, researchers found that mice in low humidity developed more severe cases of influenza.The researchers suggest that increased humidity may reduce the dehydration of a person’s lungs that can often occur during cold weather. They also believe increased humidity may improve a person’s mucociliary clearance — the way the lungs remove mucus and harmful particles.Both of these could mean a reduction in the severity of a COVID-19 infection.As a result, the researchers wanted to see whether the reduction in disease severity associated with mask-wearing could, in principle, be explained by masks increasing the humidity of the air a person breathes.Mask types testedTo find out if masks increase the humidity of the air a person breathes, the researchers asked participants to breathe into a sealed steel box wearing one of four common types of mask: N-95 respiratorsurgical maskcotton-polyester maskheavy cotton maskThe researchers then measured the box’s humidity, comparing this to the humidity measured when a person breathed into the box without wearing a mask.This told the researchers how much moisture was being trapped by the mask, condensing on the inside of the mask and then evaporating and entering a person’s lungs as they inhaled.The scientists carried out the test at three temperatures between 46–98oF (8–37°C).Increased humidityThe researchers found that all the masks increased the humidity of the air being inhaled by the participants, particularly at lower temperatures.",humidity,neutral,"

Wesley Long, MD, PhD, a researcher at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, said, “At this point, KN95 masks are being recommended due to the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. I would recommend wearing one anytime you want to wear a mask, especially in crowded indoor spaces where social distancing cannot be maintained.”Chatterjee agreed you should wear one anytime you venture out into a public space, with them being “absolutely imperative” when traveling.She further advised that you should wear a mask whenever you are in close contact with people whose COVID-19 status is unknown.How to best use themYou’ll get the most protection from your mask if you use it properly. It’s especially important that it has a good fit on your face.Chatterjee suggests going through the following steps when you put on your mask:Sanitize your hands before picking up the mask so you don’t contaminate it.Place the mask over your face, with the bottom below your chin and the nosepiece up.Place the top strap behind your head and the lower strap below your ears.Press the metal nose clip to mold the material to the shape of your nose.Readjust the whole thing so your nose and mouth are well covered and the whole mask has a tight fit.If you are planning to wear an additional mask with the KN95, such as a surgical mask, it should go over the KN95, said Long. You want to put the best quality mask on your face first.It’s also important to use the right size mask if you are putting one on a child. Kids should use the smaller versions of the KN95 masks, said Chatterjee.“They shouldn’t be using an adult-size mask because it is often loose and will not protect from aerosols,” she said.How to avoid fake KN95 masksFinally, you want to avoid the many fake masks that have made their way onto the market.",anytime you want to wear a mask,neutral,"

Two-thirds of Canadians trust the vaccine, according to a recent survey.

 As the novel coronavirus affects over 14 million people across nations, some world leaders have come up with their own unusual remedies to combat the virus. The Covid-19 outbreak has triggered an unprecedented hunt for a vaccine. Though it seems a little far off before we have one, it has not stopped politicians and leaders across the world from recommending rather unusual and bizarre remedies ‘to keep the virus in check.’
From injecting disinfectant, drinking alcohol to consuming ‘gau mutra’ and gobar, politicians of all hues have come up with their own version of “cures”, albeit without any scientific basis. With the number of infections surpassing 14 million, the World Health Organisation has initiated a global awareness campaign named “Stop The Spread”.

Physical distancing is the practice of staying at least 6 feet away from others to avoid catching a disease such as COVID-19. As noted above, “social distancing” is a term that was used earlier in the pandemic as many people stayed home to help prevent spread of the virus.

Can social distancing prevent COVID-19?,https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/13/what-is-social-distancing/," What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as ""flattening the curve,"" which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

Can social distancing prevent COVID-19?,https://health.usnews.com/conditions/articles/flattening-the-curve-why-social-distancing-is-important-to-combat-covid-19," Without sweeping social distancing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, hospitals will run out of intensive care beds and ventilators, and staff won't be able to keep up with the needs of sick patients. More health care workers themselves will fall ill, and there will be fewer on the front lines to combat COVID-I9.Those who heed social-distancing and quarantine recommendations are decreasing the opportunity for person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, for which there is currently no proven cure or vaccine. In short, experts say, social distancing is our one and only big hope for intervening early enough to dramatically reduce the spread of the disease and deaths. Whether successful or not, the impact will be felt most among vulnerable populations, including adults over 60 and those with chronic disease, like diabetes and heart disease.

A new study shows that simply avoiding symptomatic people will not go far enough to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s because researchers have discovered that many individuals can carry the novel coronavirus without showing any of the typical symptoms of COVID-19: fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. But these asymptomatic or only mildly ill individuals can still shed virus and infect others. This conclusion adds further weight to the recent guidance from U.S. public health experts: what we need most right now to slow the stealthy spread of this new coronavirus is a full implementation of social distancing.

Social distancing for COVID-19 disease can protect health care workers, limit overcrowding of hospitals and ICUs, help to slow a shortage of much needed health care equipment. As many people are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, social distancing can protect the high-risk groups, such as the elderly, and those with heart and lung disease. Most important, social distancing can protect you, and your family, from a virus that has no approved treatment or vaccines, yet. Social distancing can buy time for the development of an effective preventive and treatment for this novel virus.

Perhaps one of the best resources for US residents comes from The Atlantic and explains the various social situations one should look to avoid in the coming weeks. The measures may seem extreme, but they are backed by hard data. Social distancing has helped save lives in the past -- most notably during the 1918 flu pandemic. The lessons from that pandemic over a century ago are just as important today. See the emptiness as coronavirus closes landmarks, stadiums, amusement parks

Social distancing, along with wearing a mask and hand hygiene, is one of the best ways to keep the coronavirus from spreading to yourself or others. What is Social Distancing? Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping space between yourself and other people who aren’t from your household. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends keeping at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) of space between yourself and others. You should keep up that amount of space whether you’re indoors or outdoors.","Social distancing, along with wearing a mask and hand hygiene",neutral,"

The best practices for controlling an infectious disease like COVID-19 aren’t easy to follow—keeping six feet apart from others, wearing face masks in public, and, if you’re a health care worker, wearing shields to protect your eyes as well. But in a study published Monday in The Lancet, researchers provide the strongest evidence yet that these practices do indeed lower the risk of spreading the virus. An international group of scientists, led by senior author Dr. Holger Schunemann, professor of clinical epidemiology and medicine at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, analyzed 172 studies conducted in 16 countries that looked at the connection between social distancing, wearing masks, and wearing eye protection, and the risk of transmitting the virus.",Wearing Face Masks,neutral,"

Your immune system is very sophisticated and it relies on a number of healthful substances — primarily from plant-based foods — to keep it operating well. In addition to eating a balanced diet, another well-documented, immune-enhancing habit is to sleep for the recommended seven to nine hours each night.2. Apple cider vinegar may prevent blood sugar spikesThough there are better ways to control blood sugar — for example, by modifying your carb intake, eating meals at consistent times and staying active — this ACV claim has some supporting evidence to back it up. One small study suggested that vinegar may improve insulin sensitivity, which means that your body may be more sensitive to the way insulin is transporting glucose from the bloodstream into your cells where it can be used for energy. Another small study suggested that drinking a two-tablespoon shot of ACV at bedtime resulted in better fasting blood sugar levels the following morning.Can apple cider vinegar curb your appetite?Aug.",won’t prevent you from getting COVID-19,no,"

Can vinegar prevent COVID-19?,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/gargling-water-with-salt-wont-eliminate-coronavirus/," One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us. “You’re not rinsing it away so it doesn’t go to your lungs,” Dela Cruz, also director of the university’s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports that symptoms — often fever, cough or shortness of breath — appear within 14 days of exposure. As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said “the key is to limit getting infected.” He emphasized health officials’ guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.",it doesn’t kill the virus,no,"

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html," If you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of treatments, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to treat the virus, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications. Convalescent Plasma
Some people with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment may benefit from a treatment called convalescent plasma. Your healthcare provider can help decide whether this treatment is right for you. Managing COVID-19 symptoms

Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better.",Your healthcare provider can help decide whether this treatment is right for you,neutral,"

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

In August, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19. To be eligible to donate convalescent plasma, the donor must have a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19, be symptom free, be at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 lbs.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-applications-inds-cber-regulated-products/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma," Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral,"

See how it works








Is convalescent plasma a treatment for COVID-19? Right now, it is not known if convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, there’s some evidence that suggests it can help some patients with COVID-19. While convalescent plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by many people, further investigation is still needed to determine if it can shorten the duration of illness, reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent death associated with COVID-19. Because there isn’t an approved treatment for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment in certain people.",it is not known,neutral,"

Plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing immune cells and  antibodies – proteins the body makes to fight infection. The plasma can be infused into a sick person to help recovery. Since the Victorian era, doctors have used this treatment to fight severe cases of the flu. The treatment has also shown success with two other deadly coronaviruses - MERS and SARS.

On paper, treatment with convalescent plasma makes good sense. The idea is to take blood plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and infuse it into patients with active infections. The antibodies in the donated plasma, in theory, would help fight the virus. Based on that idea, last March Dr. Nicole Bouvier at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York decided to give it a try. She recalls thinking, ""we have this new disease that didn't have any known therapies, and convalescent plasma has been used in new epidemic and pandemic diseases,"" as recently as in an Ebola outbreak in West Africa a few years ago.","On paper, treatment with convalescent plasma makes good sense",neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/using-convalescent-blood-to-treat-covid-19-is-it-possible," This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently.Recently, researchers and healthcare professionals have been looking into the possibility of using this method to treat people with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In the United States, a group of researchers and doctors from 57 institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are investigating and applying convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.This is a concerted initiative — called the “National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project” — born after the publication of a viewpoint paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation in March, 2020.The paper argued for the potential merits of passive antibody therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. It was authored by immunologists Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.To understand more about convalescent plasma therapy, its merits, its risks, and its current use in COVID-19 treatments, Medical News Today recently spoke to Dr. Casadevall.Here is what he told us, alongside more information on the current state of convalescent plasma therapy.A therapy ‘used for over 100 years’So, where did the idea of using convalescent plasma, or passive antibody therapy, come from?This notion was first introduced in the late 19th century when physiologist Emil von Behring and bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburou discovered that they could use antibodies present in serum — another blood component — to fight the bacterial infection diptheria.Since then, doctors have used passive antibody therapy, on and off, at least since the 1930s to treat or prevent both bacterial and viral infections, including forms of pneumonia, meningitis, and measles.When we asked him how the idea of using convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 came about, Dr. Casadevall told us: “I have worked on antibodies my entire life professional life […], and I knew that convalescent plasma — or sera […] — was being used for over 100 years.”“In fact, the first Nobel Prize was given [to Behring] for the use of serum to treat diphtheria, so I knew the history.” This long history of successfully using this method against different infectious diseases suggested that it might also be effective against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.“I knew that in epidemics when you don’t have a lot of things, […] the blood of those who recover can have antibodies that can be used [as treatment],” Dr. Casadevall explained.“So it’s an old idea, it’s been around for a long time, and I think that my contribution was, in fact, to alert my friends, authorities, that this [therapy] could be used in this epidemic.”Recent research has already shown that people who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 have developed antibodies that can react to the coronavirus.“There [are] now multiple studies that have shown that when people recover from the virus, they have in their blood neutralizing antibodies that are able to kill the virus,” Dr. Casadevall also told MNT.Although “[p]eople differ greatly in the amount of antibodies that they make — some make large amounts, some make small amounts — […] the good news is that most have [them],” he added.Given the willingness of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate blood, the method seems feasible right now. In fact, some doctors are already using convalescent plasma therapy in some cases.Settling the matter of safetyIn the U.S., the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project have already been trialing this method as widely as possible.Dr. Casadevall told MNT that “in the United States, we have close to 12,000” people who have received the convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19.Based on the data obtained from a little less than half of this cohort, Dr. Casadevall and his colleagues have concluded that this approach is safe for the patients receiving treatment — the first step necessary before ascertaining the method’s effectiveness.The team has reported these findings in a preprint that they have made available online.“[On May 14], we put out a paper on the first 5,000 [patients] showing that [this therapy] was relatively safe. That’s the first step,” Dr. Casadevall explained.“You want to show safety. And then the question of efficacy will be coming in the next few weeks.",This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-shows-no-significant-benefit-convalescent-plasma-covid-19-outpatients-early-symptoms," Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization to allow use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Researchers wanted to know whether administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial in persons who were recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, but who were not severely ill and could be treated as outpatients. The objective was to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 illness. The C3PO trial, launched in August 2020, was designed to answer that question. The randomized, controlled clinical trial involved adult outpatients who presented to emergency departments with mild COVID-19 symptoms during their first week post-infection. The trial was conducted by the SIREN clinical trials network, and enrolled more than 500 participants from 48 emergency departments across the United States.",administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.uab.edu/reporter/patient-care/advances/item/9237-new-studies-test-convalescent-plasma-as-covid-19-treatment-and-prevention," The president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Thomas File Jr., M.D., noted in a statement that “while the data to date show some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with COVID-19, especially if given early in the trajectory of the disease, we lack the randomized, controlled-trial data we need to better understand its utility in COVID-19 treatment.”
Existing studies have not had a control group, making it impossible to statistically demonstrate that patients who received convalescent plasma treatment fared better than those who did not. Furthermore, convalescent plasma has only been used in hospitalized patients, Heath said, and studies to date suggest that earlier use in the course of disease may be more beneficial. The two new studies are enrolling non-hospitalized patients at UAB to address these knowledge gaps, Heath said. So what’s the latest on convalescent plasma, who is eligible for the new trials and who can donate? Heath answered our questions.

""The results show a 54% efficacy in reducing hospitalization if you give it up to day nine. It is clear and highly significant,"" he said.",OffOnStream onConvalescent,neutral,"

   What Other Studies Showed  

Research on convalescent plasma use in COVID patients has produced mixed results. In August, the Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Outpatients found that convalescent plasma was not effective against COVID-19 when it was given to patients within the first week after their symptoms appeared. NIH Says No Benefit of Convalescent Plasma as COVID-19 Treatment



In early December, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against using convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19, except in clinical trials. Likewise, the use of convalescent plasma is not allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for outpatient use except, again, in clinical trials. At the webinar announcing the study’s results, Gebo said that the collection of convalescent plasma could be done on a larger scale if its use were to be approved.",convalescent plasma was not effective,no,"
no

See how it works








Is convalescent plasma a treatment for COVID-19? Right now, it is not known if convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, there’s some evidence that suggests it can help some patients with COVID-19. While convalescent plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by many people, further investigation is still needed to determine if it can shorten the duration of illness, reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent death associated with COVID-19. Because there isn’t an approved treatment for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment in certain people.",it is not known,neutral,"

The good thing is that a person who recovers can produce enough plasma to treat two or three other people. SD: Convalescent plasma is still in clinical trials, but a study in The BMJ suggested that it has no effect on mortality of COVID patients. AC: The study is inconclusive [because] plasma was used late. If you look at the study, 82% of the patients already had their own antibodies.",no effect on mortality of COVID patients,no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2021/08/24/study-finds-convalescent-plasma-therapy-ineffective-for-covid-19/," Researchers determined that COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma did not have a lower incidence of developing severe symptoms compared with those who received the placebo. The researchers hoped the treatment would reduce disease progression by 10%; instead the reduction was less than 2%. Though researchers conceded that the treatment might be effective in certain other cases, such as preventing symptoms after exposure. In the trial, 257 people received convalescent plasma and 254 people received the placebo. ""This trial showed the importance of rigorously testing potential therapies for COVID-19,"" said School of Medicine professor Kevin Schulman, MD, of the Clinical Excellence Research Center, who held the Investigational New Drug Application for the trial. ""While this trial was negative, we need to continue this research to understand when passive immunotherapy such as convalescent plasma can be effective in treating emerging infectious diseases.""",did not have a lower incidence of developing severe symptoms,no,"

VERDICT
There is currently no strong evidence for the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Overall, the limited studies identified were subject to methodological flaws. Several ongoing trials of  lopinavir/ritonavir are currenty recruiting. BACKGROUND
There are currently no pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatments, there has been increased interest in re-purposing currently available drugs for immediate use. The antiretroviral drug lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, which is widely used for the treatment of HIV and is a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",There is currently no strong evidence,neutral,"

no.

Can lopinavir-ritonavir cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32678815/," The evidence from randomized trials shows lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce mortality (relative risk: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.3; low certainty evidence), but the anticipated magnitude of the absolute reduction in mortality, varies across different risk groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir also had a slight reduction in the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, developing respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it did not lead to any difference in the duration of hospitalization and may lead to an increase in the number of total adverse effects. The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low. Conclusions:

        Abstract
        
      


Objectives: To systematically review the clinical literature reporting the use of Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) for the treatment of patients with Cornonavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) to assess the efficacy of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19.Methods: The authors systematically searched PubMed and MedRxiv databases for studies describing treatment of COVID-19 patients using LPV/r compared to other therapies. Articles were excluded if they were case reports, opinion editorials, preclinical studies, single-armed studies, not written in English, not relevant to the topic, or published before May 2020. The included outcomes were viral clearance as measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and/or improvement on chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, and adverse events.Results: Among 858 total studies, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative review. These studies consisted of 3 randomized control trials, 3 open-label trials, and 10 observational studies. Most of these studies did not report positive clinical outcomes with LPV/r treatment.Conclusion: The systematic review revealed insufficient evidence of effectiveness and clinical benefit of LPV/r in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","

Can lopinavir-ritonavir cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34849001/," Treatment with favipiravir has shown promising improvement in the clinical status of COVID-19 patients, although the results suggested no significant differences in some clinical parameters such as length of hospitalizations and clinical recovery. A combination of favipiravir with other supportive therapy showed more favorable outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients reported no significant clinical improvement compared to standard care with notable adverse effect reactions. Conclusion:

Can ayurveda cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32680602/," So far in Modern Western Medicine (MWM), no cure has been found which is specific to COVID-19. The only literature relevant to the treatment of Coronavirus disease has surfaced from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM which was extensively used to control the epidemic in China, also consists of herbal medicines similar to Ayurveda. In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill. Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the variety of pertinent medicines present in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia which can be used more rationally to suit every stage of the disease.",the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period,neutral,"

The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves. However, it's not quite as good as we might have hoped. In a recent study – which looked at whether UVC could be used to disinfect PPE – the authors found that, while it is possible to kill the virus this way, in one experiment it needed the highest exposure out of hundreds of viruses that have been looked at so far. The amount of ultraviolet required varied widely, depending on factors such as the shape and type of material the virus was on.

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-can-you-kill-coronavirus-with-uv-light," Though there hasn’t been any research looking at how UVC affects Covid-19 specifically, studies have shown that it can be used against other coronaviruses, such as Sars. The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves. However, it's not quite as good as we might have hoped. In a recent study – which looked at whether UVC could be used to disinfect PPE – the authors found that, while it is possible to kill the virus this way, in one experiment it needed the highest exposure out of hundreds of viruses that have been looked at so far. The amount of ultraviolet required varied widely, depending on factors such as the shape and type of material the virus was on. Nevertheless, a concentrated form of UVC is now on the front line in the fight against Covid-19.",it's not quite as good as we might have hoped,neutral,"

For example, consider using lockable switches or placing switches in a restricted area that only trained staff can access using a lock and key. This prevents the UV lamps from being turned on or off unintentionally and allows the fixtures to be safely powered off when necessary without fear of them being powered on during maintenance. Influenza viruses are more susceptible to UV energy than the bacteria that causes TB. Thus, any upper-room UVGI system installed to help during the COVID-19 pandemic will also be useful against seasonal flu, if it is properly maintained. 3

UV in general and UV-LEDs are effective in combatting pathogens, [but] UV should be used carefully. — Yoram Gerchman, PhD


Gerchman proposes using UV-LED lights in air conditioning systems to help filter air that might contain SARS-CoV-2, which ""could help in reducing exposure."" Study Finds Alcohol-Free Hand Sanitizer Effective Against COVID-19



The study's co-authors also proposed using the technology in vacuum and water systems to quickly and efficiently disinfect large surfaces and spaces. Gerchman says that “UV in general and UV-LEDs are effective in combatting pathogens,” but adds that “UV should be used carefully.”



“I believe we are nearing the end of the COVID-19 [pandemic] with the vaccination approval, but airborne and waterborne pathogens—especially antibiotic resistance pathogens—will be with us for many years to follow,” Gerchman says. “UV is and will take part in battling such.”

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.edweek.org/leadership/should-schools-use-uv-light-to-eliminate-covid-19/2021/03," So what, if any, role can UV systems play in controlling COVID-19 in schools? Here’s what district leaders need to know. What does ultraviolet light do? Ultraviolet light is categorized based on its wavelength, measured in nanometers. UVA (315-399 nm) and UVB (280-314 nm) penetrate more deeply into human tissue and are associated with sunburn, skin cancer, etc. UVC (100-279 nm) can still cause eye damage or skin irritation with exposure, but around 254 nm germicidal ultraviolet light has long been shown to destroy the outer protein coating of viruses that cause measles and the SARS-coronavirus—a close relative of the coronaviruses that cause COVID-19.UVA and UVB light have been found less effective at deactivating virus particles and potentially more dangerous to people if they are exposed to the radiation.Researchers have also been experimenting with so-called “far UVC,” or light at the shorter 222 nm wavelength, which has been shown to be effective at destroying related coronaviruses in a lab and is now being tested to determine whether it is safe to be used in occupied areas.",can still cause eye damage or skin irritation,no,"

More than 99.9% of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets were killed when exposed to a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light that is safe to use around humans, a new study at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has found. “Based on our results, continuous airborne disinfection with far-UVC light at the current regulatory limit could greatly reduce the level of airborne virus in indoor environments occupied by people,” says the study’s lead author David Brenner, PhD, Higgins Professor of Radiation Biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The research was published today in Scientific Reports. Background
Conventional germicidal UVC light (254 nm wavelength) can be used to disinfect unoccupied spaces such as empty hospital rooms or empty subway cars, but direct exposure to these conventional UV lamps is not possible in occupied public spaces, as this could be a health hazard. To continuously and safely disinfect occupied indoor areas, researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center have been investigating far-UVC light  (222 nm wavelength).",99.9%,neutral,"

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.preventcancer.org/2020/04/uv-light-should-not-be-used-to-prevent-or-treat-covid-19/," Despite recent speculation, there is no evidence that UV radiation has any impact on the virus. The Prevent Cancer Foundation® cautions anyone considering using UV radiation to stop immediately and speak with a trained medical professional. Though there’s no evidence that UV radiation can protect you from COVID-19, it can pose a serious risk to your health. Whether through exposure to the sun or through a tanning bed, exposure to UV radiation significantly increases your risk for skin cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Too much exposure to UV rays can cause skin cancers, including melanoma (the deadliest type of skin cancer), basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. UV exposure can also cause cataracts and cancers of the eye (ocular melanoma).",no evidence that UV radiation can protect you from COVID-19,yes,"

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, it's been assumed that UV light can kill SARS-CoV-2. After all, most microbes are susceptible to UV light, and previous research showed that other coronaviruses could be killed by UV. But data was lacking. Now, a South Korean company called Seoul Semiconductor, which worked in collaboration with Korea University and two American universities, claims to have designed a UV LED (light-emitting diode) that is able to kill 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in 30 seconds.

Is it safe to use a UV light for disinfection purposes at home?FIT breaks down these questions for you.ADVERTISEMENTCan UV light be used to deactivate the novel coronavirus?Yes, UV light can be used to destroy or deactivate the novel coronavirus.It is produced by the sun and by special lamps, and is divided into three main types – UVA, UVB, and UVC – based on their wavelengths.Research shows that the UVC light, which has the wavelength of light from 200 to 280 nanometres, is able to inactivate the genetic material in previously seen coronaviruses. A more recent study shows that it can also destroy the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or COVID-19.What wavelengths of UVC lights are effective against COVID-19?This UVC light is much “stronger” than normal sunlight and has a wavelength that ranges from 200 to 280 nanometres.Exposure to a wavelength of around 252-254 nanometres for 10 minutes deactivates or kills bacteria and viruses by damaging their cell walls in case of SARS-CoV-1. It can also be used for SARS-CoV-2. However, these wavelengths are extremely harmful to humans.Studies have also shown that far-UVC light (207–222nm) efficiently deactivates human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which have not shown any harmful effects on human skin.ADVERTISEMENTIs it safe to use a UVC light for disinfection at home?It depends on how one uses the UVC light for disinfection.",200 to 280 nanometres,neutral,"

Actually, we've known that UV light kills a lot of different germs since the late 1800s when scientists discovered that shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet light rays emitted by the sun — what we now call ultraviolet-C rays or UVC light — could kill bacteria. And unlike the longer wavelengths of the sun's UV light, UVC rays don't naturally hit the Earth's surface, so they're particularly lethal for microbes that haven't had a chance to adapt to them. Since then, UVC technology has been used for sanitation. Hospitals and water treatment plants, for example, rely on the rays to kill mold, viruses and bacteria. And with the promising research into COVID-19-killing potential, UVC light-emitting machines are being utilized more — popping up in empty subway cars and even the air ducts of many public places, including restaurants.",UVC rays don't naturally hit the Earth's surface,neutral,"

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://wholefoodsmagazine.com/supplements/features-supplements/black-seed-oil-benefits-backed-by-science/," Researchers have considered the use of black seed oil in cases of COVID-19. Researchers decided to look into it specifically because, in Africa, some people have consumed black seed oil in an attempt to combat COVID-19, including the Governor of Oyo State in Nigeria. The research is interesting, but preliminary: At press time, there’s only one study regarding this matter, and it was done in silico—“in silicon,” or as a computer simulation. The researchers note in the study that there are certain components of the coronavirus that are necessary to its survival, including 3CLpro, which binds to human cell receptor ACE2 in order to produce RNA and proteins that allow the virus to proliferate (16). Thus, drugs that bind to 3CLpro and ACE2—preventing the virus from binding to human cells and proliferating—are of great interest, when it comes to helping people survive COVID-19 and decreasing severity of the disease. For instance, Remdesivir, the only drug currently approved to treat COVID-19, functions by binding to ACE2.",some people have consumed black seed oil,neutral,"

In particular, it may protect against Candida albicans, which is a yeast that can lead to candidiasis (46, 47).While early research shows promise in the applications of black seed oil, more studies in humans are needed to confirm these effects and the optimal dosage. summaryBlack seed oil is high in antioxidants and may have several benefits for health. These include the treatment of asthma and various skin conditions, lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, aiding in weight loss, and protecting brain health.Potential side effects and safety concernsWhen used in small amounts for cooking, black seed oil is likely safe for most people.

 A recent study published in the journal Chemrxiv has demonstrated how compounds from black seed inhibit COVID-19. The study titled “Identification of Compounds from Nigella Sativa as New Potential Inhibitors of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Molecular Docking Study” was conducted by Salim Bouchentouf Noureddine Missoum. The study noted: “The spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of specific treatment and the urgent situation requires use of all resources to remedy this scourge. In the present study, using molecular docking, we identify new probable inhibitors of COVID-19 by molecules from Nigella sativa L, which is highly reputed healing herb in North African societies and both Islamic and Christian traditions. The discovery of the Mpro protease structure in COVID-19 provides a great opportunity to identify potential drug candidates for treatment. Focusing on the main proteases in CoVs (3CLpro/Mpro) (PDB ID 6LU7 and 2GTB); docking of compounds from Nigella Sativa and drugs under clinical test was performed using Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE).",compounds from black seed inhibit COVID-19,neutral,"

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is being used in conjunction with other medicines in a number of clinical trials for patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus). Results of one study show Covid-19 patients treated with oseltamivir had a significantly shorter stay in the hospital and significantly lower death rate compared to the control group. This study did have limitations, and the authors noted that more prospective studies need to be done to clarify the clinical benefit of oseltamivir with other antiviral and combination therapies.",Is Tamiflu used to treat COVID-19,neutral,"

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called ""Tamiflu approach"" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston. ""One of the real things for controlling the pandemic is making sure that drugs can get to the people who need them,"" Butterton told MedPage Today.

Taking Tamiflu for a COVID-19 infection would be like using a bear trap to catch a shark. Is the coronavirus pandemic complicating the prescription of Tamiflu? Yes, Barron says. Prior to the pandemic, doctors could prescribe Tamiflu with a high degree of confidence to high-risk patients who called in to report flu-like symptoms.

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4701," Both have harms that have been inadequately researched and reported.While the truth about Tamiflu emerged only after years of exhaustive work by the Cochrane review group and investigative journalists,2 the machinations behind remdesivir’s rapid climb were evident at an early stage. On 29 April, the same day as a trial was published showing no significant effect of remdesivir among patients in hospital, remdesivir’s manufacturer rushed out interim findings of a more favourable trial by press release and with full White House honours. The much vaunted but minimal benefits shown in severely ill people were used to justify FDA approvals and worldwide purchase.3 Now a much larger trial has found little or no benefit in hospital patients,4 and a BMJ Rapid Recommendation, produced in collaboration with the World Health Organization and Magic App, has come down against use of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 of any severity.5Science by press release, on the basis of interim or ad hoc analyses, and without access to the data, also afflicts our knowledge about the covid-19 candidate vaccines.67 Patients and the public deserve better than this. So do health professionals. Pandemic or no pandemic, decisions must be based on scrutiny of the full data from trials that are independent of drug and vaccine manufacturers.8The pandemic has had a particular damaging impact on children,9 many of whom are going hungry as winter and the economic effects of covid restrictions bite harder.

Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.In a new study, scientists have found three previously-available drugs that may be effective at treating COVID-19 in its early stages.The research, which appears in the journal ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science, is valuable in helping researchers identify treatment candidates for clinical trials.COVID-19 treatmentsSARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have had a profoundly negative effect on global economies, culture, people’s everyday lives, and above all, on people’s health.To date, there have been more than 1,150,000 recorded deaths from the disease. There is also mounting anecdotal evidence of the long-term negative health effects it can have on people who recover from the initial illness.Due to COVID-19’s lethality, and the fact that the disease is highly contagious, scientists are rushing to develop a vaccine. However, producing vaccines that are also safe and effective takes a considerable amount of time.According to a report in The Lancet, on average, vaccines take 10 years to develop. Even with experts greatly accelerating research due to the urgency of the global pandemic, the report notes that an initial vaccine may take more than 18 months to be developed, manufactured, and distributed to people around the world.Consequently, scientists have been researching vaccines and potential treatments that may ultimately reduce the chance of a person dying if they develop the disease.This typically involves repurposing previously available drugs that may also be effective in treating COVID-19.",may be effective at treating COVID-19 in its early stages,neutral,"

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/9-things-to-know-about-covid-pill," There is a key difference, though, says Dr. Shaw. “Tamiflu works through a different mechanism—by interfering with the entry of influenza virus into cells—instead of targeting the reproduction of viral RNA,” he says.However, Tamiflu can be given in a single dose to prevent infection with the flu, “like a post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP],” says Dr. Meyer, explaining how some people may be prescribed antiviral medications after a potential exposure to a disease, like HIV, to prevent infection. “Molnupiravir has not yet been tested as a PEP against COVID-19,” she says, “but that would be a hope for the future.”   Currently, the FDA has not authorized the use of molnupiravir for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. 4. Does molnupiravir prevent infection or severe illness and death?The goal of the Merck pill is to keep people out of the hospital, explains Dr. Meyer. “We want to prevent severe illness and death in people who are infected with mild-to-moderate COVID, but who are not yet hospitalized,” says Dr. Meyer.",Molnupiravir has not yet been tested as a PEP,neutral,"

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/covid-19-therapeutics-what-evidence-shows," Early in the pandemic, researchers turned to existing drugs to determine whether they could effectively treat COVID-19. While research continues on that front, scientists are also looking at new or repurposed, never approved antivirals that can treat COVID-19 early in the disease, Dr. Woodcock said. Dr. Farley said it’s important to look for treatments that have clinical benefit for the patient. For example, there are companies working medication that would improve symptoms faster. The idea is to obtain drugs to help alleviate COVID-19 symptoms in the way that oseltamivir (marketed as Tamiflu) can help treat patients with influenza. The priority, he said, is “to keep our highest-risk patients out of the hospital right now, and hopefully we are getting those high-risk patients vaccinated as quickly as possible.”

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tamiflu-most-effective-if-you-are-at-risk-for-complications/," Tamiflu interferes with the proteins the flu virus uses to reproduce, giving your immune system time to destroy it. “Tamiflu can be used to prevent infection if taken shortly after exposure,” says Dr. Allan. But if you’re already sick, it’s also helpful in curbing symptoms and shortening your recovery time. Researchers find that taking Tamiflu within 48 hours of symptom onset can shave approximately one day off a typical seven-to-10-day illness. A more recent study showed that in patients aged 65 years and older (who had more severe illness and other health conditions), up to two to three days could be trimmed using Tamiflu.

Antibody drugs have been shown to do just that, but these drugs need to be given via an IV, making them difficult to deploy quickly to a large number of people. A pill would be far more convenient.“Unless we can persuade enough people to agree to vaccination, we are going to need a second approach, and oral antivirals can give us that,” says Richard Plemper, a molecular virologist and biochemist at Georgia State University.An antiviral pill for COVID-19 would work similarly to a course of antibiotics. Your doctor would prescribe a pack of pills, and you’d take one or two a day for five to seven days while you stay at home.

Gareth IacobucciThe BMJThe UK government has made a huge investment in antivirals to fight covid, but some experts are concerned the waste and overspending of the 2000s will recur. Gareth Iacobucci reportsThe government’s Antivirals Taskforce has procured more antivirals per population than any other country in Europe, with over 4.98 million courses ordered so far.1 Included within this is 2.75 million courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral drug Paxlovid (a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets).Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, has estimated, using publicly available drug prices in the US, that the UK has spent £2.2bn (€2.6bn; $2.8bn) so far on procuring antivirals. “There’s a vast amount of money involved,” he told The BMJ. “As usual, all government contracts are confidential, so maybe they got some discount. But if the UK paid US prices, which it has with vaccines, then it has spent around £2.2bn on antivirals for covid.”Uncertain evidenceYet, despite this huge investment, evidence for the effectiveness of antivirals remains uncertain.Last November Pfizer reported results from an interim analysis of phase 2/3 data showing that Paxlovid, the second oral antiviral drug for covid-19 to be authorised for use in the UK, can reduce the relative risk of death or hospital admission by 89%.2 The government has seized on these results to justify its investment.",reduce the relative risk of death or hospital admission by 89%.,neutral,"

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/tamiflu-most-effective-if-you-are-at-risk-for-complications/," Tamiflu interferes with the proteins the flu virus uses to reproduce, giving your immune system time to destroy it. “Tamiflu can be used to prevent infection if taken shortly after exposure,” says Dr. Allan. But if you’re already sick, it’s also helpful in curbing symptoms and shortening your recovery time. Researchers find that taking Tamiflu within 48 hours of symptom onset can shave approximately one day off a typical seven-to-10-day illness. A more recent study showed that in patients aged 65 years and older (who had more severe illness and other health conditions), up to two to three days could be trimmed using Tamiflu.

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.drugs.com/tips/tamiflu-patient-tips," How it works

Tamiflu is a brand (trade) name for oseltamivir. Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is an antiviral agent that may be used to treat acute and uncomplicated infections due to influenza A or B viruses in people who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. The manufacturer suggests oseltamivir works by inhibiting viral neuraminidase, an enzyme that enables viruses to be released from their host cell. However, a Cochrane review suggests oseltamivir reduces symptoms of influenza by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which reduces the immune response. It may also work centrally (through the brain) to lower temperature. The Cochrane reviewers did not find any evidence of influenza-virus-specific action.",by inhibiting viral neuraminidase,neutral,"

Can burning neem leaves treat COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35434432/," Displacement of the virus bound to the VE, and/or inhibition of binding of the virus, would constitute an effective strategy for preventing COVID-19. In this regard, the acetone-water extract of the leaf of the Neem (Azadirachta indica) plant has been known to prevent the adherence of malaria parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) to VE; prevent cytoadherence of cancer cells in metastasis; and prevent HIV from invading target T lymphocytes. We therefore hypothesize that this Neem leaf acetone-water extract will prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the VE, and therefore be an effective therapeutic formulation against COVID-19. It is therefore advocated herein that this extract be investigated through rigorous clinical trials for this purpose. It has the advantages of being (i) readily available, and renewable in favor of the populations positioned to benefit from it; (ii) simple to prepare; and (iii) devoid of any detectable toxicity.

By blocking entry and reducing viral replication, the extract also relieved other complications that COVID-19 causes, including inflammation in the brain and hepatitis in mice models. Overall, the neem compounds showed potential as antiviral agents both for protecting against infection and mitigating disease severity after infection. Moreover, the researchers highlighted that the multi-targeted nature of its effects—particularly its capacity to bind to several spike regions—may make the extract effective against new variants that carry mutations in their spike protein. Moving forward, the researchers aim to identify the specific compounds in the neem bark that are responsible for the antiviral effects. That could help guide the development of neem-based antiviral therapies and determining the dosage requirements for treating coronavirus infections.",antiviral agents,neutral,"

Comment:







The pandemic’s uncertainty and stress, combined with disrupted routines, may have encouraged some people to progress into heavier drinking habits, along with undercutting efforts to remain sober, though it’s still too soon for much peer-reviewed data, psychologists say. Potential stressors that can foster more reliance on alcohol are nearly ubiquitous these days—from financial insecurity to juggling work and childcare from home to protests and racial unrest. Alcohol misuse also boosts the chance of contracting the virus, as it can impair the body’s immune system, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and people with substance use disorders are both more likely to develop COVID-19 and experience worse COVID-19 outcomes (Wang, Q., et al, Molecular Psychiatry, 2020). There’s also the risk that people are more prone to let their guard down about distancing, hand-washing and other safety protocols while under the influence, psychologists say (see Drinking and pandemic safety during the pandemic).",people with substance use disorders,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      



          Bachground:
        
      
      In the early stages of the pandemic, the first reports began that alcohol consumption could increase the risk of becoming infected and worsening the prognosis disease. This is for two reasons: behavioral and socio-economic factors that characterize a part of this population can be the cause of viral spread and a direct or indirect negative action of ethanol on the immune system. Methods:
        
      
      The data used for the preparation of these recommendations are based on a detailed analysis of the scientific literature published before March 31, 2022 (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the process of developing this work, we consulted the guidelines / position papers of the Italian Society on Alcohol and of the World Health Organization. Results:
        
      
      It has been confirmed that AC is in COVID-19 era a risky behavior and that AUD and substance use disorder (SUD) patients are certainly at greater risk of contracting infection and also of having a worse course. Conclusions:
        
      
      In light of what has been said recommendations can be made: correctly inform the general population that AC negatively interacts with COVID-19 infection; reducing the COVID-19 risk by advocating healthy lifestyle habits (smoke, diet, physical exercise, etc) and preferential policies in population with comorbidities; implement actions that reduce the average consumption of alcohol by avoiding hazardous/harmful consumption.",greater risk of contracting infection and also of having a worse course,neutral,"

For more coronavirus news and stories, click here. The study states alcohol has a 'deleterious effect' on your immune system and will not stimulate immunity and virus resistance. In fact, drinking could make your immune system worse at fighting the virus, the WHO says. (Stock image) People having a drink outside a restaurant

Comment:







The pandemic’s uncertainty and stress, combined with disrupted routines, may have encouraged some people to progress into heavier drinking habits, along with undercutting efforts to remain sober, though it’s still too soon for much peer-reviewed data, psychologists say. Potential stressors that can foster more reliance on alcohol are nearly ubiquitous these days—from financial insecurity to juggling work and childcare from home to protests and racial unrest. Alcohol misuse also boosts the chance of contracting the virus, as it can impair the body’s immune system, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and people with substance use disorders are both more likely to develop COVID-19 and experience worse COVID-19 outcomes (Wang, Q., et al, Molecular Psychiatry, 2020). There’s also the risk that people are more prone to let their guard down about distancing, hand-washing and other safety protocols while under the influence, psychologists say (see Drinking and pandemic safety during the pandemic).",people with substance use disorders,neutral,"

Unwinding with a glass of wine or a ""quarantini"" might seem like a good way to cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. But for some people, too much alcohol is making the ongoing health crisis worse. ""There are data to indicate people are drinking more than usual,"" said Dr. Mariann Piano, a substance abuse researcher.

The population level changes for women, younger, and non-Hispanic White individuals highlight  that  health systems may need to educate consumers through print or online media about increased alcohol use during the pandemic and identify factors associated with susceptibility and resilience to the impacts of COVID-19. Study limitations include that measures are self-reports, which may be subject to social desirability bias. Additionally, not all baseline respondents completed wave 2, although nonrespondents did not significantly differ from completers on any of the outcome measures at baseline. Nonetheless, these results suggest that examination of whether increases in alcohol use persist as the pandemic continues and whether psychological and physical well-being are subsequently affected may be warranted.

As a 2015 issue of Alcohol Research: Current Reviews summarized, a number of studies have shown how excessive alcohol consumption can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to pneumonia, acute respiratory stress syndromes (ARDS), and sepsis. Yep, those are exactly the things that you worry about when you get infected by SARS-CoV2, as I detailed previously for Forbes. Alcohol can affect the production and function of many of your immune system cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. It can also weaken the cells lining your respiratory tract and the tiny little hairs called cilia that help sweep up and out bad stuff from your respiratory tract.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that drinking alcohol will not protect against infection or illness from COVID-19.

Why four or five drinks could affect your COVID-19 vaccine response
""Binge drinking"" can impact immune system




  









  





While there isn't enough data to offer scientific evidence of alcohol's possible impact on coronavirus vaccines, experts have been mixed on recommendations on drinking before and after gettting the shot. By:

SAN DIEGO (KGTV) -- Research has shown alcohol can affect the immune system, but there’s debate among health experts about whether drinking could impact the COVID-19 vaccines.There are no published studies on whether alcohol decreases the effectiveness or intensifies the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA and CDC have offered no formal guidance that people curtail drinking before or after the shots.Studies on alcohol and the effectiveness of other vaccines offer mixed results. One study found long-term, heavy drinkers produced fewer antibodies to the pneumococcal vaccine. But what about just a few drinks before or after the shot?Many U.S. doctors have suggested that one or two drinks won’t significantly affect the immune response.",debate among health experts about whether drinking could impact the COVID-19 vaccines,neutral,"

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 

Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs.",Humidity,neutral,"

Heat, humidity and UV rays linked to COVID-19 spread, YSPH findsThe new, Yale-led study provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.By Michael GreenwoodJune 14, 2021

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

The new findings apply only to airborne transmission. “It doesn’t matter if you live in Singapore, India, or the Arctic, you still need to wash your hands and practice social distancing,” cautions Prof. Iwasaki.That said, the review concludes that studies in mice suggest that a relative humidity of 40–60% is ideal for containing the virus.“That’s why I recommend humidifiers during the winter in buildings,” says the study’s senior author.Other studies in mice also found that an environment of 50% relative humidity contributed to good viral clearance and an efficient immune response.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesCOVID-19Share this articleBy Ana Sandoiu on April 2, 2020 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, MPHLatest newsCurcumin and traditional Chinese remedy combo may help treat ulcerative colitisGut microbiome may impact the progression of endometriosisHow urinary tract infections (UTIs) negatively impact women's quality of lifeDementia: Surgically fixing cerebrospinal fluid leaks may reverse symptomsRunning as a form of escapism may lead to dependence, study suggestsRelated CoverageCOVID-19: 5 reasons to be cautiously hopefulWe round up some of the research on COVID-19 that has emerged recently and produced results that may hopefully help tackle the global pandemic.READ MOREWhat WHO advisor David Heymann told us about COVID-19Medical News Today spoke to WHO advisor and infectious disease expert Professor David Heymann about the current COVID-19 pandemic.READ MOREHow close is a COVID-19 vaccine?

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.accuweather.com/en/health-wellness/new-study-says-high-temperature-and-high-relative-humidity-significantly-reduce-spread-of-covid-19/703418," Researchers studied 100 different Chinese cities that had more than 40 cases of COVID-19 from Jan. 21 to 23. A team of researchers unveiled the results of a new study last week that looked at how temperature and humidity may affect the transmission of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. According to the researchers' findings, “High temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.” An increase of just one degree Celsius and 1% relative humidity increase substantially lower the virus’s transmission, according to the data analyzed by the researchers. The study is the latest in a limited but growing body of research, not all of which has been peer-reviewed, that examines the effect of weather on the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 illness.

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/researchers-propose-humidity-masks-may-lessen-severity-covid-19," “High levels of humidity have been shown to mitigate severity of the flu, and it may be applicable to severity of COVID-19 through a similar mechanism.”

Dr. Adriaan Bax sits in front of lab equipment.NIDDK

High levels of humidity can limit the spread of a virus to the lungs by promoting mucociliary clearance (MCC), a defense mechanism that removes mucus − and potentially harmful particles within the mucus − from the lungs. High levels of humidity can also bolster the immune system by producing special proteins, called interferons, that fight against viruses − a process known as the interferon response. Low levels of humidity have been shown to impair both MCC and the interferon response, which may be one reason why people are likelier to get respiratory infections in cold weather. The study tested four common types of masks: an N95 mask, a three-ply disposable surgical mask, a two-ply cotton-polyester mask, and a heavy cotton mask. The researchers measured the level of humidity by having a volunteer breathe into a sealed steel box. When the person wore no mask, the water vapor of the exhaled breath filled the box, leading to a rapid increase in humidity inside the box.",it may be applicable to severity of COVID-19 through a similar mechanism,neutral,"

A potentially important weapon against COVID-19 has emerged from two unrelated and seemingly unremarkable observations.The first came several years ago when Walter Hugentobler, a Swiss physician who sometimes practices at a clinic in Zurich International Airport, noticed several years ago that pilots and flight attendants seemed unusually susceptible to the flu throughout the year, even though they were generally healthy.More recently, Hazhir Rahmandad, an engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, noticed that COVID-19 tended to spread in his native Iran at different rates from one region to the next, even when population densities were similar.Both scientists followed up with studies that have converged on an important insight into COVID-19: the spread of the disease is likely to vary significantly with temperature and humidity.This characteristic of the virus offers hope that we can mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus with simple measures such as installing humidifiers in the home. In the dry winter months, cold air gets pulled into the home and heated, which lowers the relative humidity—in other words, the heated air is capable of holding more moisture than it actually contains. Such dry air impairs the lungs' ability to clear out invading viruses and the immune system's ability to keep the virus from replicating. ""We spend 90 percent of our lives indoors, where the air is very dry in the winter,"" says Akiko Iwasaki, a Yale immunobiologist who led one of the studies, with Hugentobler as a co-author. ""That's exactly when the virus best survives and transmits.",the spread of the disease is likely to vary significantly,neutral,"

Low temperatures and high humidity help the virus surviveFor their investigation, the researchers looked at the most common size of droplet that people with COVID-19 spew out: about 5 nanoliters, or ""the width of a human hair,"" Bhardwaj said.They did not look at the lifespan of aerosols, which are clouds of even tinier viral particles. Once droplets evaporate, the coronavirus that's left behind quickly dies. So the chances of transmission depend on the droplets' lifespan.The study authors compared drying time in two different temperatures: 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), both with 50% humidity. That 15-degree increase halved the time it took droplets to evaporate, they found.They also observed that an increase in relative humidity from 10% to 90% increased the evaporation time of a droplet almost seven-fold (with a steady temperature of 25 degrees Celsius).

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-ventilation-filtration-and-humidity-may-prevent-coronavirus-transmission," Viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, which causes COVID-19, move from one host to another through the air. A research team at the University of Oregon says ventilation, filtration, and humidity levels of an indoor room can reduce how easily a virus spreads. Additionally, they found there was not much difference in the number of virus particles projected through the air between people standing 4 feet (ft) or 11 ft away. The team believes their findings can assist building operators in creating an indoor environment that helps improve the health and safety of those inside.

Another study published March 1 in the Journal of Hospital Infection examined the lifespans of various human coronaviruses on many different surfaces. The study authors found that spikes in temperature made a difference in the lifespans of coronaviruses across surfaces. For example, an 18-degree Fahrenheit (32-degree Celsius) jump, from 68 degrees to 86 degrees, decreased how long SARS lasted on steel surfaces by at least half.This may be because some coronaviruses (and the flu) have a viral envelope: a layer of fat that protects viral particles when traveling from person to person in the air. But that sheath can dry out faster in warmer temperatures, disabling the virus.Increases in temperature and humidity correlate with number of new daily casesThe researchers also examined the average number of cases per day from February 8 through February 29 in countries with significant coronavirus outbreaks, like Italy, Australia, Thailand, and the US. Their research revealed that the average number of new daily cases during that time period in a place like Italy, where the temperature hovered around 48 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius), was four times the number of new cases in a place like Thailand, where temperatures were closer to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).The same was true for humidity: the greater the percentage of relative humidity is the fewer number of new cases.Basically, humidity is how much moisture is in the air, or how clammy your skin feels outside.",significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19,neutral,"

This prevents the virus from multiplying. Researchers began a randomized, controlled trial of the antiviral in February 2020 to test whether remdesivir could be used to treat SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. By April, early results indicated that remdesivir accelerated recovery for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. It became the first drug to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people hospitalized with COVID-19.

This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under a mechanism called emergency use authorization (EUA), which is not the same as approval. FDA also revised the EUA for Veklury, originally issued on May 1, 2020, to permit the drug’s use for treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. As a public health agency, FDA uses the best scientific information available to make decisions through a deliberative process. Drugs must undergo a rigorous evaluation of safety, quality, and effectiveness before they can be approved for use in the United States.

Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://time.com/5839932/how-remdesivir-works-coronavirus/," It was initially developed to treat Hepatitis C and RSV, a virus that causes respiratory infections. It was also researched as a treatment for Ebola as well as SARS and MERS—two other coronaviruses that infect humans much like the virus that causes COVID-19. It never made it to the approval stage for those uses, but over the last four months, scientists desperate for options to help mitigate the coronavirus pandemic have been looking towards old drugs that could be repurposed. Remdesivir has in that time traveled an unprecedented path to regulatory approval, becoming one of the most promising therapies against COVID-19 to date. Remdesivir isn’t a vaccine, and so it can’t prevent infection; instead, it works by attacking the virus once it is already spreading inside the body.",it works by attacking the virus once it is already spreading inside the body,neutral,"

It's the only early treatment available to children under 12. Plus it works against omicron – while some other early treatment options do not. And, while other early treatments are in short supply, there's plenty of remdesivir to go around. Federal agencies now recommend remdesivir as one of four options for treating early COVID-19.

This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under a mechanism called emergency use authorization (EUA), which is not the same as approval. FDA also revised the EUA for Veklury, originally issued on May 1, 2020, to permit the drug’s use for treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. As a public health agency, FDA uses the best scientific information available to make decisions through a deliberative process. Drugs must undergo a rigorous evaluation of safety, quality, and effectiveness before they can be approved for use in the United States. FDA approval of a drug regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) means that CDER has reviewed data on the drug’s effects, and the agency has determined the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks for the approved population when used according to the drug’s approved labeling.",FDA approved Veklury,neutral,"

The median recovery time was 11 days for patients who got remdesivir compared to 15 days for those in the placebo control group. The study also suggested that remdesivir offers a survival benefit: The group that received remdesivir had a mortality rate of 8.0% versus 11.6% for those in the placebo group.Full results are expected at the end of May, but in light of the urgency of this crisis, on May 1, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir. An EUA is different from full FDA approval and is reserved for instances where some data suggest a drug might be helpful in treating a disease on an emergency basis.This EUA makes remdesivir the first drug approved for use to treat COVID-19. But it's not for everyone, and several experts are urging caution in our rush to deal with the pandemic.Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, a clinical internist and hospitalist in the department of internal medicine and chief quality and patient safety officer at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, says the early results about remdesivir are showing ""some really promising attributes in terms of therapy,"" but he notes that we shouldn't be looking at it as ""a potential panacea for this pandemic.",remdesivir offers a survival benefit,neutral,"

It was also researched as a treatment for Ebola as well as SARS and MERS—two other coronaviruses that infect humans much like the virus that causes COVID-19. It never made it to the approval stage for those uses, but over the last four months, scientists desperate for options to help mitigate the coronavirus pandemic have been looking towards old drugs that could be repurposed. Remdesivir has in that time traveled an unprecedented path to regulatory approval, becoming one of the most promising therapies against COVID-19 to date.

Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Remdesivir, a drug that once offered hope against Ebola, is now in the spotlight as the only current effective medication for COVID-19. But experts caution that it’s no “silver bullet” against the disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.The drug’s history, though, shows the long and arduous path that compounds take from initial development to reaching the marketplace — a journey that many of these potential drugs never finish.Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. began research on remdesivir in 2009, as part of research programs for hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Later testing showed that the drug had broad-spectrum antiviral activity.This led to initial animal studies against the Ebola virus. The drug, though, failed to live up to expectations, coming up short against two other drugs in a landmark clinical trial published last year.Even before COVID-19, Gilead had tested remdesivir against other coronaviruses — including those that cause SARS and MERS — in laboratory and animal studies. However, no clinical trials were done because there were too few MERS cases and no SARS cases at the time.At the beginning of this year, when scientists determined that the new pneumonia-like illness in China was caused by a coronavirus, Gilead provided remdesivir to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to test the drug against the virus.Remdesivir is thought to interfere with the mechanism that certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, use to make copies of themselves.",it’s no “silver bullet,neutral,"

The antiviral drug remdesivir has been approved for emergency use among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in recent studies, has shown promise as a treatment for the pandemic disease. How exactly does remdesivir counter SARS-CoV-2 -- the coronavirus strain responsible for COVID-19? With hat tips to virologist Jan Carette, PhD, geneticist Judith Frydman, PhD, and infectious-disease expert Bob Shafer, MD, let's follow the coronavirus downstream as it courses through its agenda within the infected cell. Toward the end, we'll zero in on one of the virus's several Achilles heels, and we'll see how remdesivir could help -- and alas, why it may not be able to save the day on its own.

WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients















WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients

20 November 2020
















WHO has updated its recommendation on remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.On 22 April 2022, following publication of new data from a clinical trial looking at the outcome of admission to hospital, WHO now suggests the use of remdesivir in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization. Latest information on COVID-19 therapeutics.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.This recommendation, released on 20 November, is part of a living guideline on clinical care for COVID-19. It was developed by an international guideline development group, which includes 28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners and one ethicist. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support. The guidelines are an innovation, matching scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic.",there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes,neutral,"
no.

Review. Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. Search methods:
        
      
      We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions.","

Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/04/17/is-remdesivir-the-drug-that-can-kill-the-coronavirus," For our coronavirus tracker and more coverage, see our hubAN EFFECTIVE DRUG to treat covid-19 would transform the battle against the pandemic. Without one, whole countries have had to lock themselves down to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus which has infected more than 2m people and killed nearly 150,000, according to official records; the real toll is probably much greater.An effective treatment would allow countries to loosen some of the restrictions that are strangling their economies. They would be able to risk more people catching the virus in the knowledge that they could be cured. This hope has energised the hunt for a drug against covid-19 since the early days of the pandemic. President Donald Trump, for one, has touted hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug. But it is remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, that is proving the most exciting.",they could be cured,neutral,"

Because its safety had been shown in the earlier trials, remdesivir quickly moved into clinical trials for COVID-19. What do we know from clinical trials? Three clinical trials so far have reported on remdesivir’s effects on COVID-19. The only one that has been published is a clinical trial in China that compared remdesivir against placebo and found no benefit from the drug, but the trial did not enroll enough patients to have statistical power. (The epidemic had waned in Wuhan and fewer sick patients were available at the time of the trial.)",it also stops replication of SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

The need for therapeutics
COVID-19 is caused by infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, which engages and enters host cells through its spike protein. At present, there are more than 138.3 million documented cases globally, with the death toll nearing three million. Though vaccines have been approved for emergency use, their efficacy against some of the new variants has been questioned. Moreover, vaccination coverage of at least 70% of the population in all the countries of the world is likely to take a long time, considering the current pace of vaccination, the shortfall in vaccine production, and logistical challenges.",curcumin,neutral,"

Can turmeric treat COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34122090/," Curcumin, an active constituent of Curcuma longa (turmeric), has several properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, anti-thrombotic, and anti-proliferative effects, which make it a promising candidate for the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19. Objective: We aimed to determine the effects of curcumin administered with piperine (to optimize absorption) on symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial at a 30-bed dedicated COVID Health Center (DCHC) in Maharashtra, India. Methods: In addition to conventional COVID-19 treatment, patients in the control group received a dose of probiotics twice a day, and patients in the study group received curcumin (525 mg) with piperine (2.5 mg) in tablet form twice a day. The effects of curcumin/piperine treatment on primary and secondary outcomes were assessed for the duration of hospitalization. Results: Patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms who received curcumin/piperine treatment showed early symptomatic recovery (fever, cough, sore throat, and breathlessness), less deterioration, fewer red flag signs, better ability to maintain oxygen saturation above 94% on room air, and better clinical outcomes compared to patients of the control group. Furthermore, curcumin/piperine treatment appeared to reduce the duration of hospitalization in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, and fewer deaths were observed in the curcumin/piperine treatment group.",symptomatic treatment,neutral,"

Coronavirus Vaccine Live Updates: As per a study published in the Journal of General Virology, curcumin- a naturally-occurring chemical compound found in the spice turmeric, has potential antiviral properties and can prove to be effective in eliminating certain viruses. The study showed that curcumin can prevent Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)- an alpha-group coronavirus that infects pigs, from infecting cells. The higher doses of curcumin were also found to kill virus particles. TGEV causes a disease called transmissible gastroenteritis in piglets, characterized by diarrhoea, acute dehydration and death. The virus is highly infectious and proves to be fatal in piglets who are younger than two weeks.Also Read: COVID-19 vaccine will be called 'Covishield' in India, says Adar PoonawallaFollow BusinessToday.In for all the latest updates on coronavirus vaccine: 3.15 pm: Coronavirus vaccine updates: To take coronavirus first or last: Donald Trump in pickleUS President Donald Trump has said that he is ready to take COVID-19 vaccine- first or last- as people want.",curcumin,neutral,"

Ajaikumar Kunnumakkara, professor at the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, evaluated the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. The search showed numerous cases that have reported the potency of spices, including turmeric, to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation. They are cheap and relatively safe to consume and their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, he reports in Life Sciences published on January 30, 2021. The reason curcumin, and by association turmeric, has not been used as an allopathic drug is because the substance’s poor bioavailability (duration of its presence in the blood).

A plant-based diet can help prevent severe cases of COVID-19 and may reduce the risk of becoming infected altogether, according to two studies. Subscribe:


 





 




Contact the Show







Dr. Neal Barnard explores research analyzing the diets of health care workers in six countries. The findings show that eating less meat and dairy and more fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of severe infection by as much as 73%. However, a low-carb keto diet appears to significantly increase the likelihood of becoming severely ill.
Dr. Barnard and “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll also discuss a second study of nearly 600,000 people that not only confirms the protection against severe symptoms, but also reveals that a plant-based diet can provide protection from becoming infected at all. Data on vaccine efficacy and safety, the delta variant, breakthrough cases, and infection trends are also discussed. More on COVID-19

Can a vegetarian diet prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-022-01082-w," Analyzing data from 592,571 participants, Merino et al. showed that a dietary pattern characterized by healthy plant-based foods was associated with a 9% lower risk of Covid-19 infection and a 41% lower risk of severe Covid-19 [3]. The dietary data from 568 Covid-19 cases and 2316 controls from healthcare workers from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with substantial exposure to Covid-19 patients have demonstrated that those following a plant-based diet had a 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe Covid-19 [4].Needless to say, plant-based diets were already beneficial for human health before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. The Global Burden of Disease Study showed that low fruit, vegetable, and whole grain consumption, and, in contrast, high red and processed meat consumption are currently among the main global risks [5]. Proper nutrition may help prevent almost half of cardio-metabolic deaths in the US [5]. Specifically, a plant-based diet seems to decrease all-cause mortality and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, partly by effectively improving nutrient intake [6], and thereby addressing the underlying health conditions that put our population at such a great risk of severe Covid mortality and morbidity.In the context of Covid-19, we can draw a lesson from the “Blue Zones,” areas of particularly high longevity [7].",Proper nutrition may help prevent almost half of cardio-metabolic deaths,neutral,"

Scientists found that people who reported eating the most fruits, vegetables, and legumes had a 9% lower risk of getting COVID and a 41% lower risk of developing severe COVID during the study period, compared with people who reported eating the least fruits and vegetables. Researchers also found a link between COVID and a poor diet or socioeconomic disadvantages. ""If you could remove just one of those factors — diet or disadvantage — we think nearly a third of the COVID-19 cases could have been prevented,"" notes Jordi Merino, the study’s lead author and a research associate at the Diabetes Unit and Center for Genomic Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

Viruses like COVID-19, SARS, bovine spongiform, swine flu and avian flu all have something in common: They all come from animals, described by scientists as zoonotic diseases. Yet, these diseases do not really “come from animals.” After all, it is not like animals conspire against humans, throwing COVID-19 over the backyard fence. When we say this pandemic “comes from animals,” it means that these diseases come from the way society raises, harvests and eats animals.",it is not like animals conspire against humans,no,"

The results were striking: Participants who reported following plant-based diets, vegetarian diets, or pescatarian diets had 59 percent lower odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The reduction was even greater when looking solely at those who followed plant-based and vegetarian diets: Those participants had 73 percent lower odds of experiencing moderate-to-severe COVID-19, compared with participants who did not follow a plant-based or vegetarian diet. These associations did not substantially change even when adjusting for potential confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions, body weight, smoking status, exercise, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). In contrast, those who followed low-carb, high-protein diets had a 48 percent greater risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 compared with other participants, in a model adjusting for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and medical specialty. Compared with those who followed plant-based diets, low-carb, high-protein eaters had a nearly four-fold greater risk.

There is, I think, another link between veganism and COVID-19, and one less widely acknowledged. COVID-19 lockdowns around the world show us that when thousands of human lives are on the line, we are collectively willing to make drastic changes to our lifestyles, affecting our day-to-day activities, our economy, our education systems, and much more. Perhaps we should be willing to make another collective shift in our daily lives. Perhaps we should, as a society, as a global community, transition away from diets containing animal products, and towards veganism.

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32291526/," Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses.

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.tctmd.com/news/ace-inhibitors-arbs-and-covid-19-new-insights-advice," Though these benefits with ACE inhibitors/ARBs are usually appreciated over long-term use, there are some benefits that can be lost even with short-term discontinuation. Also, though there is concern ACE inhibitors/ARBs could be harmful in COVID-19, we feel there is equal level of suggestion that they can be helpful. In this case, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors/ARBs may worsen COVID-19.”  
Not Enough Evidence
Anxiety over the link between COVID-19 and ACE inhibitors/ARBs stems from the known interplay between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. “ACE2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral entry for SARS-CoV-2 with increasing evidence that it has a protracted role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,” Patel and Verma write. It’s possible that ACE inhibitors could directly inhibit ACE2, but “ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase and is not inhibited by clinically prescribed ACE inhibitors,” they say in their JAMA paper. “In addition, there is concern that the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs will increase expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation.”

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-conoravirus-blood-pressure-ins-idUSKCN2251GQ," That’s normally a good thing. But the coronavirus also targets ACE2 and has developed spikes that can latch on to the enzyme and penetrate cells, researchers have found. So more enzymes provide more targets for the virus, potentially increasing the chance of infection or making it more severe.Other evidence, however, suggests the infection’s interference with ACE2 may lead to higher levels of a hormone that causes inflammation, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a dangerous build-up of fluid in the lungs. In that case, ARBs may be beneficial because they block some of the hormone’s damaging effects.Novartis International AG and Sanofi SA are among the major drugmakers selling ACE inhibitors and ARBs.Sanofi spokesman Nicolas Kressmann said that patients should consult their doctors on whether to continue taking the drugs but that the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19 through its own assessment of available scientific data.The company reviewed several recent studies from China that came to conflicting conclusions about whether COVID-19 patients with hypertension fare worse than other patients, he said.Novartis has not issued any guidance to clinicians or patients and defers to scientists studying the issue, said spokesman Eric Althoff.Researchers and doctors generally agree that people with severe hypertension or heart failure should keep taking the drugs because of the high risks of stopping. The debate centers on how to advise the many patients with milder conditions who take the drugs. Two camps have emerged - one calling for no action unless the drugs are proven dangerous, the other for some limits on their use until they are proven safe.The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at University of Oxford in England has recommended that clinicians consider withdrawing the medicines in patients with mild hypertension if they are in a high risk group, such as medical workers - and replacing them with alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs.The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) took the opposite tack, highlighting the drugs’ potential in fighting coronavirus and recommending patients continue taking the drugs until more about the risks is known.",the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19,neutral,"

More of TCTMD's coverage on our COVID-19 hub. Senior investigator Vassilios Vassiliou, MBBS, PhD (University of East Anglia, Norwich, England), said it’s become increasingly clear that patients already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB should continue taking the drugs if they become infected with COVID-19.

The definitive answer must await the results of prospective randomized controlled outcome trials to document their benefit in COVID infected patients or at least a lack of increased risk in patients who are COVID naive. There are several prospective, interventional trials currently underway to examine the use of ACEI/ARB on outcomes in patients with COVID-19. These include randomized clinical trials where the ACEI or ARB are discontinued in a COVID-19 infected patient already on one of these agents.22 Two others involve the randomized use of losartan in COVID-19 infected patients for outcomes in both outpatient and inpatient settings (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT04312009, NCT04311177).23,24 Another involves switching patients already on ACEI or ARB to a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04330300).25

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/new-evidence-concerning-safety-of-ace-inhibitors-arbs-in-covid-19," This triggers a series of enzymatic reactions mediated through the ACE-1 receptor to raise blood pressure, constrict blood vessels, and retain sodium.The ACE-2 receptor, when stimulated, does the reverse. It causes vasodilation, excretion of sodium, retention of potassium, and a decrease in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which are popular medications used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease, can raise ACE-2 levels.There was a concern that more surface receptors in the lung would allow more of COVID-19 to enter cells or make the effect of the virus much worse. There is no proof of this, but it does make some sense.An editorial in The Lancet early in the COVID-19 pandemic stated that physicians should stop the medications that work on the renin-angiotensin system.2A media firestorm erupted, leading to the publication of a paper endorsed by all the leading cardiology journals in the United States and Europe to refute the editorial, urging physicians and patients not to stop their medications.3 Since then, potential therapies have been developed to either prevent the virus from attaching to the ACE-2 receptor, decreasing the amount of ACE-2 or increasing the level of ACE-2.In one scenario, flooding the body with circulating ACE-2 might fool the virus into attaching to the circulating ACE-2 and not bind to surface receptors. In another scenario, decreasing ACE-2 levels would prevent the virus from entering a large number of cells, allowing natural immunity to kill the virus.Since these receptors have multiple other functions, particularly in cardiovascular regulation, it is unclear to me whether they could cause more harm than good. Nothing done to human systems occurs in isolation, and changing a variable will influence other variables.On April 22, 2020, it was reported in Circulation Research, that a large, well-designed study done in China showed that among patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19, inpatient treatment with ACE inhibitor/ARBs was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACE inhibitor/ARB nonusers during 28 days of follow-up.",raise ACE-2 levels,neutral,"

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/ace-inhibitors-arbs-do-not-worsen-covid-19-risk," A systematic review finds little evidence to back those fears.The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) does not appear to worsen the severity of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), according to new research.The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, also found that there is likely no connection between such medications and the chance of a symptomatic patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The results refute concerns by some that these medications might make patients more vulnerable amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Corresponding author Devan Kansagara, MD, MCR, of the Veterans Health Administration’s Portland Health Care System, explained in the study that early evidence from China showing hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with COVID-19, and that patients with those pre-existing conditions were experiencing more severe cases, led some experts to hypothesize that the 2 types of therapies might in some way be making people more susceptible to the disease.“The proposed mechanism by which ACEIs and ARBs may play a role in COVID-19 is through upregulation of the angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is presumed to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells,” Kansagara and colleagues wrote.Still, they noted that investigators have not yet been able to consistently demonstrate such an upregulation. Furthermore, others have hypothesized that the drugs might actually help patients fight off the virus.In an attempt to get to the bottom of the question, the investigators pulled together existing literature from medical databases, including ClinicalTrials.gov, that involved patients taking ACEIs or ARBs and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates or COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The study is being structured as a living systematic review, with plans to continue ongoing surveillance for a year.Though about half of the studies were small and did not adjust for confounding variables, Kansagara and colleagues found consistent outcomes in the research. Two retrospective studies showed use of the therapies was not connected with a higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and a third case-control study found no link between the drugs and COVID-19 illness.Beyond that, the investigators located 14 observational studies, with more than 23,000 enrollees, that consistently failed to show a link between disease severity and the 2 medications.The group also found 4 registered randomized trials that are designed not to gauge ACEIs and ARBs as potential exacerbating factors in COVID-19, but rather to test them as possible therapies for the disease.Altogether, the Kansagara and colleagues said they have high certaining that the drugs are not associated with more severe disease, and moderate certainty that the drugs aren’t associated with higher rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in symptomatic patients.“On the basis of the findings from this rapidly expanding literature, no indication exists to prophylactically stop ACEI or ARB treatment because of concerns about COVID-19,” investigators concluded.",does not appear to worsen the severity,no,"

No Worse COVID-19 Prognosis With ACE Inhibitors, ARBs: ‘Living’ Review Suggests


It remains to be seen whether the drugs increase the likelihood of infection or whether they may in fact be helpful treatments. By

    Yael L. Maxwell
  




































Created with Sketch. May 21, 2020





Patients on long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not at increased risk for a poorer COVID-19 prognosis, according to a new analysis of the limited evidence to date. However, the data are less conclusive on whether use of these drugs is associated with a greater likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and—an even greyer area—whether they might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. In the early weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, there was initial speculation that use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might worsen patient prognosis because the ACE2 receptor is thought to be the point of entry for the virus into host cells. Also, hypertension and diabetes kept reappearing as common comorbidities of infected patients.",are not at increased risk for a poorer COVID-19 prognosis,no,"

Writing in the June 2nd British Medical Journal, investigative reporters Stéphane Horel and Ties Keyzer discounted this possibility, alleging that the authors of some of the relevant research were in the pocket of Big Tobacco and their studies have been discredited:
In the early days of the pandemic, media outlets around the world reported that smokers seemed to be under-represented among patients seriously ill with covid-19 in China and France. The headlines asked, does nicotine protect against covid-19? … It has since been roundly disproved that smoking protects against covid-19 … the BMJ can today also report on undisclosed financial links between certain scientific authors and the tobacco and e-cigarette industry in a number of covid research papers.

Summary of the current knowledge on smoking and COVID-19. Recent available data indicate that individuals with a smoking history are more likely to acquire more severe COVID-19 outcomes, including intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality, than non-smokers. Moreover, research findings also indicate that smokers exhibit increased expression ACE-II receptors, which acts as a binding site for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence, therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2/ACE-II interaction may offer a path for the development of COVID-19 treatments. See this image and copyright information in PMC

FAQs About Smoking and COVID-19
Does smoking increase my risk of getting COVID-19 and make the symptoms of COVID-19 worse? At this time, we don’t know if smoking will increase your chance of getting COVID-19. We do know that smoking damages your lungs and that COVID-19 causes mild to severe breathing problems. This means that if you keep smoking and you become sick with COVID-19, you’re more likely to have worse symptoms than someone who doesn’t smoke and gets COVID-19. You’re also more likely to:

Need to go to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)


Need to be hooked up to a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe


Die from COVID-19

FAQs About Smoking and COVID-19
Does smoking increase my risk of getting COVID-19 and make the symptoms of COVID-19 worse? At this time, we don’t know if smoking will increase your chance of getting COVID-19. We do know that smoking damages your lungs and that COVID-19 causes mild to severe breathing problems. This means that if you keep smoking and you become sick with COVID-19, you’re more likely to have worse symptoms than someone who doesn’t smoke and gets COVID-19. You’re also more likely to:

Need to go to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)


Need to be hooked up to a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe


Die from COVID-19

Coronavirus: How coronavirus COVID-19 attacks the bodyHow does coronavirus enter the body, and why does it become fatal for some compared to just a cough or fever for others?Just the FAQs, USA TODAYThe claim: Nicotine substitutes could have a positive effect in fighting COVID-19Amid coronavirus news, claims have surfaced that nicotine could contribute to preventing people from contracting COVID-19.This followed the release of a study suggesting that those who smoke daily are less likely to develop a severe case of the virus.Different news outlets, including The Daily Mail and The New York Post, reported on the findings from the French study, which came from the Pitié Salpêtrière, a major hospital in Paris.“Nicotine may be suggested as a potential preventive agent against COVID-19 infection,” the study reads. “Both the epidemiological/clinical evidence and the in-silico findings may suggest that COVID-19 infection is a nAChR disease that could be prevented and may be controlled by nicotine.”More: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?The study acknowledges that nicotine is a drug of abuse and could have severe pathological consequences. But it states that in controlled settings, nicotine could provide an efficient treatment.“Results showed that of the patients hospitalized, with a median age of 65, only 4.4 percent were regular smokers,” the Daily Mail piece reads. “But among those at home, with a median age of 44, 5.3 percent smoked.”The Daily Mail article continued: ""By comparison, among the general population, 40 percent of those between ages 44 and 53 smoke, and around 11 percent of those aged 65 to 75 smoke. The researchers determined that far fewer smokers appear to have contracted the virus or, if they have, their symptoms are less serious. ""The study examined 480 coronavirus patients.France reacts, limits sales of nicotine substitutesShortly after the study was released, the French government banned online sales of nicotine replacements, such as nicotine gum and patches, and warned that pharmacies that dispense treatments for tobacco addiction must limit the amount they issue per person, Business Insider reported.“Because of media coverage of the potentially protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19, there is a high risk of a significant rise in the pharmacy dispensing and Internet sale of nicotine replacement treatments over the coming days,” a draft order from the European Commission reads.The order explains the limitations are necessary to regulate the pharmacy dispensing and the internet sale of nicotine substitutes.",could be prevented and may be controlled by nicotine,neutral,"

Editor's Note: This story was updated on Oct. 26, 2021, to accurately reflect the number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19. While there is no definitive proof that smoking makes someone more susceptible to contracting COVID-19, Cedars-Sinai experts say smokers could have increased risk for being hospitalized or being placed on a ventilator if they get the virus.Illnesses that smokers often develop impact many of the same major organs as COVID-19. Doctors and researchers have noted that the lungs, heart and the vascular system are particularly vulnerable when a person becomes infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.“Smokers often have serious heart and lung health problems already. Add COVID-19 to the mix and you are likely to get a very sick patient; they just don’t have the physiological reserves to deal with the massive inflammatory attack brought on by the coronavirus,” said Joseph E. Ebinger, MD,  a cardiologist with the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai.Each year, 480,000 people in the United States die from smoking-related illnesses, including heart attacks, stroke and the slow suffocation brought on by emphysema, one of the chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that currently 16 million Americans live with a disease caused by smoking.COVID-19 has claimed more than 730,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC, but so far researchers have not found a cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and an elevated risk of getting COVID-19 or dying from it.“If getting through COVID-19 is like running a 100-meter dash, smokers are having to carry sandbags with them while trying to finish the race,” Ebinger said.In addition to compromised immune systems, many smokers and vapers already have lung problems that leave them more vulnerable to getting the flu, pneumonia or bronchitis.",there is no definitive proof,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a34394784/blood-type-coronavirus-covid-19/," In 2020, scientists started talking about a link between blood type and Covid. That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility.

Key Takeaways

Type O blood may have a protective effect against COVID-19.Most data shows there's no difference in COVID-19 susceptibility among people with A, AB, and B blood types. Ongoing research indicates that people with type O blood seem to have a slightly lower risk of contracting COVID-19. While it’s too soon to know why type O blood offers a protective effect against the disease, several studies suggest there is a correlation. One of the largest data sets on the topic comes from the genetic testing company 23andMe, which has surveyed over a million people since April. The company’s survey data shows that people with type O blood are 9% to 18% less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than people with other blood types. “We think this finding is going to be really essential to the scientific community to understand the biological mechanism behind COVID-19 susceptibility: Why do some people get impacted and not others?” Anjali Shastri, PhD, Senior Research Program Manager at 23andMe, tells Verywell.",Type O blood may have a protective effect,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://bodyecology.com/articles/blood-type-and-covid-19/," The key finding?1

People with the O blood type (whether O positive or O negative) had a lower incidence of COVID-19 positive tests. The reduction in risk appeared to be about 9 to 18 percent for people with an O blood type compared with other blood types, among which there was little difference in susceptibility. This difference in risk of testing positive for COVID-19 seemed to hold even when researchers took into account age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and co-morbidities (i.e., pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes). After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, and high-risk co-morbidity or being immunocompromised, those with blood type O were, on average, 14-percent less likely to acquire a COVID-19 infection and 19-percent less likely to be hospitalized for the infection. In populations at high-risk for exposure, such as healthcare workers, essential workers, and people exposed to a known case of the disease, the O blood type had an even greater protective effect, reducing the risk of acquiring the virus by 19 percent. This isn’t the first time blood type and COVID-19 have been linked
Earlier studies have also found that blood type is correlated with the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV2.",there was little difference in susceptibility,neutral,"

Patients with type O and rhesus negative (Rh-) blood groups may have a lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Investigators conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 225,556 patients who had their ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019, and subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 15 and June 30, 2020. The mean age was 53.8 years and 29% were men. Common comorbidities included preexisting cardiac disease (13-15%), chronic kidney disease (11%), anemia (21%), cancer (27-29%), dementia or frailty (33-38%), diabetes mellitus (21%), asthma (18-21%), and chronic hypertension (39-41%).

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/blood-type-covid-19-risk," A comprehensive review of studies published in Seminars in Vascular Surgery in September 2021 examined peer-reviewed journal articles published from March 2020 to January 2021. Researchers found inconsistent findings but did identify certain trends suggesting that blood type A might predispose one to increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), or that type O and Rh-negative blood groups might be protective. Still, the study authors wrote, ""the impact of blood type on clinical outcomes remains unclear. At this point in time, there does not appear to be any relationship between blood type and COVID-19–related severity of illness or mortality."" The Role of Blood Type and Virus Risk

China  Having the O blood type may reduce a person's chances of catching the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to preliminary research by biotechnology company 23andMe.Early data from over 750,000 people taking part in an ongoing study suggests that those with the O blood type are between 9 to 18 percent less likely to test positive for the coronavirus than others. In individuals who had likely been exposed to the virus, such as healthcare and essential workers and those with known contact with cases, those with the O blood group were 13 to 26 percent less likely to test positive. The team didn't find a significant difference in how susceptible those with other blood types were. Those with type O were also less likely to be hospitalized.A spokesperson for 23andMe told Newsweek the results were released on the company's website, and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

People with type O blood may be less likely to contract COVID-19 or suffer severe symptoms related to the illness, according to two studies published Wednesday. In the first, Danish researchers analyzed a sample of 7,422 people who tested positive for the virus and found that only 38 percent had type O blood, according to research published in the journal Blood Advances. Meanwhile, 44 percent of people with type A blood had contracted the deadly bug.",People with type O blood may be less likely to contract COVID-19,neutral,"

"
Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32496734/," The blood group types did not affect the clinical outcomes. The blood group A was statistically significantly more frequent among those infected with COVID-19 compared to controls (57% vs. 38%, P < 0.001; OR: 2.1). On the other hand, the frequency of blood group O was significantly lower in the COVID-19 patients, compared to the control group (24.8% vs. 37.2%, P: 0.001; OR: 1.8). Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of the present study suggest that while the blood group A might have a role in increased susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection, the blood group O might be somewhat protective.

For now, though, the researchers are confident that their principle finding—that ABO blood typing should not be considered prognostic in patients who acquire COVID-19—will help debunk the kinds of clinically unfounded rumors and misinformation that can readily gain traction in the midst of a pandemic, and in some cases become part of accepted medical practice.

Canadian researchers reached a similar finding in their retrospective study published in Annals of Internal Medicine. They found that people with type O blood had a lower risk for contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compared to those with type A, B or AB. They also observed that individuals with type O blood had a slightly lower risk for getting severely ill or dying from COVID-19 if they did become infected. And several other peer-reviewed studies reinforce these findings.

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-your-genes-predispose-you-to-covid-19/," The genetics of blood groups may offer some insight into whether you are liable to be infected with the virus. In late March Peng George Wang of the Southern University of Science and Technology in China and his colleagues released the results of a preprint study—not yet peer-reviewed—that compared the distribution of blood types among 2,173 COVID-19 patients in three hospitals in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Shenzhen with that of uninfected people in the same areas. Blood type A appears to be associated with a higher risk of contracting the virus, whereas type O offers the most protection for reasons that have yet to be determined.

Both studies were published in the journal Blood Advances. While there are several theories, researchers don’t yet know what mechanism could explain the link between different blood groups and Covid-19. Sekhon said it could be explained by people with blood type O having less of a key clotting factor making them less prone to coagulation problems in the blood.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness.

TEHRAN, IRAN -- 
	Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.

Can methanol prevent COVID-19,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ethanol-hand-sanitizer," Ethanol works to break down the structure of the proteins of bacteria. Research has shown ethanol to have antimicrobial effects against bacteria such as E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Ethanol is also effective against salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever. Concentrations of 60–80% ethanol are effective against many viruses, including herpes, influenza, and rhinovirus.The antimicrobial properties of ethanol increase with a mix of ethanol and water, making hand sanitizers more effective than pure ethanol in killing bacteria.Hand sanitizers containing isopropyl alcohol are also effective, and work in a similar way to ethanol to kill bacteria and viruses. Isopropyl alcohol may appear in products as isopropanol or 2-propanol.The CDC note that isopropyl alcohol is slightly more effective at killing E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria than ethanol.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that people choose a hand sanitizer containing ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol.Against COVID-19For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.COVID-19 occurs as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The FDA have not approved any kind of hand sanitizer to prevent or treat COVID-19.The CDC note that the best way to help prevent spreading viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, is to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Learn more about how to wash hands correctly here.However, if a person is not able to wash their hands, they can use alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol.Versus non-ethanol hand sanitizersThe CDC does not advise people to use hand sanitizer that does not contain at least 60% alcohol.

Can methanol prevent COVID-19,https://emj.bmj.com/content/37/7/416," global healthinfectious diseases, viralpoisoning, mass incidentspoisoningtoxicologyDear editorMethanol ingestion can be a highly lethal poisoning; methanol is metabolised to formaldehyde and formic acid, which are extremely toxic to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract leading to a triad of visual impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms and metabolic acidosis in 6–24 hours.1Haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic necrosis of basal ganglia, white matter necrosis, and diffuse brain oedema may result in a grave prognosis.2 3 Although alcohol consumption is illegal in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as many other Islamic countries based on religious reasons, there have been sporadic reports of alcohol poisoning, usually in the form of methanol intoxication, mostly found in illegally produced alcoholic beverages. Previous outbreaks of methanol poisoning in Iran in 2007, 2013 and 2018, resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.2–4 The most recent outbreak, and perhaps the most significant, coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. Our records show a dramatic increase in cases of methanol intoxication in March and April 2020; as of 16 April 2020, there have been 797 cases of methanol poisoning with 97 deaths in the Fars province, Iran, reported by the Head of Emergency Medical Service of the Fars province.5 These numbers, from a single province, supersede the previous largest report from the whole country (768 intoxicated subjects) in 2018,4 and there are similar reports of methanol poisonings in several other centres throughout the country during this period.Unlike prior outbreaks, the current outbreak of methanol poisoning appears to be due to the belief that consumption of disinfectants and sanitizers, specifically, alcohol, would be beneficial in preventing the COVID-19 infection. This is supported by several cases of methanol poisoning in children resulting from a desperate attempt by parents to prevent or cure the infection. When facing a serious health threat, refractory to the available remedies, such irrational decision making is anticipated, leading to quack cures and dubious prophylactic measures.6 Appropriate public education is mandatory to fight the misinformation that is being spread through social media about the alcohol and other similar disinfecting agents. This is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality and also to protect an already exhausted healthcare system from excess burden during a devastating pandemic.References↵

It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention. Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we live through this pandemic, and beyond, to protect us from diseases,’ said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. With COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance. To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste.",To stop the spread of COVID-19,neutral,"

Subsequent research has shown the biggest risk of Covid-19 transmission is through particles in the air.Why did we focus on handwashing?When little was known about Covid-19, researchers focused on fomites – surfaces such as handrails where the virus might be able to survive without a host for some time – because other diseases such as norovirus can be transmitted that way.How does Covid-19 spread?Surface transmission may happen, but speaking and coughing seem to play a much larger role, because we emit tiny aerosol water particles containing the virus. Indoors, those particles can linger for minutes or hours, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest last week that people wear two masks. It now says surface transmission is “not thought to be a common way that Covid-19 spreads”.Can handwashing prevent the spread of Covid-19?Although there is limited evidence that fomites do play a role, there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces. Public Health England put handwashing and surface cleaning at the top of updated guidance published earlier this month.

Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.When it comes to preventing viral infections — especially those that spread via droplets from coughs and sneezes — washing the hands is always the first-line measure.Now, in the midst of the recent coronavirus outbreak, correctly washing the hands remains public health officials’ top advice when it comes to controlling infection rates.In their guidelines on how to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) state that people should “[w]ash [their] hands frequently with soap and water.”Still, people continue to express doubt that something as simple as basic personal hygiene could have any effect in the context of an epidemic.New research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge aims to put those doubts to rest by showing just how important washing the hands can be in slowing down the spread of infectious disease.The study, which now appears in the journal Risk Analysis, used epidemiological modeling and data-based simulations to determine if and how better personal hygiene might affect the rate of disease transmission.30% of people do not wash their handsThe researchers started from existing data indicating that a large number of people do not wash their hands after using the restroom.According to study co-author Prof. Christos Nicolaides, “70% of […] people who go to the toilet wash their hands afterward.”“The other 30% don’t [wash their hands]. And of those that do, only 50% do it right.”– Prof. Christos NicolaidesThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that best practices for hand washing include not only rinsing the hands with water, but also applying soap and scrubbing the palms, the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.A person should scrub for at least 20 seconds before rinsing the soap and drying the hands with a clean towel.However, Prof. Nicolaides notes that of the people who do wash their hands after using the restroom, many never apply soap and spend under 15 seconds on the procedure.“We consider that, at most, 1 in 5 people in an airport have cleaned [their] hands at any given moment in time (i.e., 20% of airport population),” the researchers write in their study paper.Better hygiene may reduce disease spreadThe researchers used existing data about global flights. Specifically, they looked at flight duration, flight distance, connections, and estimates of the amount of time travelers spend in airports.Based on these measures and data from studies into how people interact with others and with their surroundings — as well as what this might mean for the potential of coming into contact with pathogens — the investigators built simulations of contagion patterns.They pinpointed 120 airports that they think play a key role in the spread of contagious agents. However, they also explain that these are not necessarily the airports with the highest traffic.For example, airports in Tokyo, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawaii, are likely to be key players in the spread of disease due to the fact that they offer direct connections to many of the world’s largest airports.",Better hygiene may reduce disease spreadThe,neutral,"

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Learn when and how you should wash your hands to stay healthy. How Germs Spread
Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections. Germs can spread from person to person or from surfaces to people when you:

Touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
Prepare or eat food and drinks with unwashed hands
Touch surfaces or objects that have germs on them
Blow your nose, cough, or sneeze into hands and then touch other people’s hands or common objects

Key Times to Wash Hands

You can help yourself and your loved ones stay healthy by washing your hands often, especially during these key times when you are likely to get and spread germs:

Before, during, and after preparing food
Before and after eating food
Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
Before and after treating a cut or wound
After using the toilet
After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
After handling pet food or pet treats
After touching garbage

There have been accounts of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizers and serious health problems caused by hand sanitizers contaminated with methanol . To be effective at killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy. Do not rely on “do-it-yourself” (or “DIY”) hand sanitizer recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.

Respiratory viruses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread when mucus or droplets containing the virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat. Most often, this happens through your hands. Hands are also one of the most common ways that the virus spreads from one person to the next. During a global pandemic, one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water.

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/handwashing-can-t-stop-millions-of-lives-are-at-stake," It’s a stark warning. Thoroughly cleaning hands with soap or an alcohol-based hand rub helps prevent a range of diseases, including the biggest killers of under-fives globally: pneumonia and diarrhoea. These two diseases combined kill approximately 1,250,000 young children each year. “Hands, face, space” has become the new mantra of the UK government’s campaign to prevent the virus. And as more countries re-open after lengthy lockdowns, continued handwashing is crucial to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 – while at the same time helping to prevent other killer diseases. But this will happen only if countries build on the increased investment in handwashing inspired by the pandemic.",if countries build on the increased investment in handwashing inspired by the pandemic,neutral,"

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,https://data.unicef.org/resources/handwashing-data-covid-19-response/," Adequate water, sanitation and hygiene services for households, schools and healthcare facilities are essential to prevent the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19. The low levels of coverage of these basic services in many parts of the world reflect substantial inequalities between and within countries and contribute to the vulnerability of these populations to the pandemic. These regional pre-COVID hygiene profiles provide an overview of the latest available data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on basic hygiene services in households, schools and healthcare facilities. They provide a baseline for assessing the extent to which populations in each region have access to handwashing facilities with water and soap at home and at school, and water and soap or hand sanitizer at points of care and near the toilets at health care facilities. Profiles are available for the following UNICEF programme regions:

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32757544/," The national and international health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO, have provided guidelines for prevention and treatment suggestions. Here, in this brief article, based on available clinical information, the author discusses why handwashing could be protective of COVID-19 infections. Although a detailed and in-depth discussion of various preventive and protective measures is beyond the scope of this article, this review will focus on the utility of frequent handwashing in minimizing the risk of spreading COVID-19 infection.

Another study, however, suggests exactly the opposite.https://p.dw.com/p/3bTRgAdvertisementSmokers are generally considered a risk group for infections with the novel coronavirus. According to a study published in the Chinese Medical Journal, they usually contract more severe and protracted forms of the disease it causes, COVID-19, than non-smokers and die more often as a result. However, French researchers led by Jean-Pierre Changeux, a neurobiologist at the Institut Pasteur, suspect that nicotine patches could help prevent infections with the dangerous virus. They have published a corresponding hypothesis on the science portal Qeios. They came to this conclusion because their data, which contradicts that of the Chinese study, shows that there seems to be only a small number of smokers among COVID-19 patients.",nicotine patches could help prevent infections with the dangerous virus,neutral,"

Writing in the June 2nd British Medical Journal, investigative reporters Stéphane Horel and Ties Keyzer discounted this possibility, alleging that the authors of some of the relevant research were in the pocket of Big Tobacco and their studies have been discredited:
In the early days of the pandemic, media outlets around the world reported that smokers seemed to be under-represented among patients seriously ill with covid-19 in China and France. The headlines asked, does nicotine protect against covid-19? … It has since been roundly disproved that smoking protects against covid-19 … the BMJ can today also report on undisclosed financial links between certain scientific authors and the tobacco and e-cigarette industry in a number of covid research papers. This, I think, is an inadequate assessment of the issue for two reasons.",protect smokers from COVID-19,neutral,"

no.
"
Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32790936/," In this regard, the ill effects of smoking are amply documented, and no doubt can be a confounding factor in COVID-19 progression. Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.

This is important to people who smoke, but it could also be of general relevance, as some have hypothesised nicotine may be a potential treatment for COVID-19. CURRENT EVIDENCE
We searched the literature for studies relating to COVID-19 and nicotine. Some are underway, and this piece will be updated as new findings emerge. In the meantime, the available research literature is mainly in the form of speculative commentaries, with some lab studies also reported. Commentaries regarding nicotine and COVID-19 all agree nicotine potentially has a role to play based on its role in the renin-angiotensin system.",some have hypothesised nicotine may be a potential treatment,neutral,"

"
Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/does-nicotine-protect-us-against-coronavirus-137488," SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, gains entry into human cells by latching onto protein receptors called ACE2, which are found on certain cells’ surfaces. The researchers have proposed nicotine attaches to the ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the virus from attaching and potentially reducing the amount of virus that can get into a person’s lung cells. The researchers are now planning to test their hypothesis in a randomised trial involving nicotine patches; though the trial is still awaiting approval from French health authorities. So how should we interpret the results? These counterintuitive results may be due to several biases, so let’s explore some alternative explanations.",preventing the virus from attaching,neutral,"

However, people would use budget-friendly alternatives for nicotine, which is cigarettes and tobacco, and this in the long term would play a major role in deteriorating their health.As far as other researches are concerned, non-medical nicotine sources have a high concentration of nicotine, especially when orally consumed. Moreover, nicotine administration can never replace other options of treatments for smoking. It can adversely motivate people to seek out additional protection from Covid-19 by consuming more.

The researchers found that two cannabinoid acids commonly found in hemp varietals of cannabis, cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, also known as CBDA, can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

While negative side effects are minimal with CBD, the article’s authors point out that CBD may have a side benefit for patients with the disease - reduced anxiety. “The many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as status of the economy, employment and loss of connection can fuel depression, fear and anxiety” they explain, pointing out that the increased inflammation in COVID-19 may also trigger increased levels of anxiety. But CBD has shown serious promise for the management of anxiety, and may help reduce these challenging levels of stress. No peer reviewed studies to date show that cannabis or its compounds can help with COVID-19 specifically, but the authors of this article say the evidence suggesting that it may help is worth further investigation. They recommend that scientists begin studies to investigate whether CBD can be used to reduce inflammation and anxiety in COVID-19 cases, as an adjunct to antiviral medications.

This is an important area of study right now, because scientists have found that in many of the most severe cases of COVID-19, there seems to be an over-production of these cytokines, also known as “cytokine storm,” which prompts the body to attack its own cells and tissues instead of fighting the virus. It’s really important to know, however, that the immune system is made up of a variety of cells and chemical signalers that interact through a complex interplay, so it’s hard to say where cannabis may help tamp down the immune system and where it may hurt by increasing the risk of infection.",tamp down the immune system,no,"

While they stressed that more research was needed, the study gave hope that the cannabis, if proven to modulate the enzyme, “may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility” as well as “become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.”

In November 2020, Erica Wilkins contracted COVID-19, underwent painful symptoms and discovered that the consumption of cannabis helped her symptoms subside and her body heal. Wilkins, the assistant manager at Bellingham’s Western Bud Cannabis Co., said hybrid edibles, which contain both CBD and THC, made a great impact on her recovery when she was ill. 
CBD, or Cannabidiol, is a compound found in the resinous flower of cannabis, and can be used for chronic pain, depression and anxiety according to Project CBD. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, on the other hand, is cannabis that can make one “high”, or intoxicated according to Project CBD.",Health & Wellness,neutral,"

Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-food/202106/cannabis-may-treat-some-symptoms-in-covid-long-haulers," Two different molecules found in the cannabis plant, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabivarin (CVN), were investigated for potential use in long-hauler COVID patients. Using a series of sophisticated molecular docking and simulation studies, scientists discovered that CBD and CVN can effectively bind to these proteins and downregulate them. Taken together, these studies suggest that some components of the cannabis plant might be beneficial as a post-covid treatment strategy. Obviously, much more research is required in order to prove the effectiveness of these cannabinoids. References

KEY POINTSA study found that two acids in cannabis bond with the protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to infect peopleSmoking marijuana would not work against the virus because the process would destroy the acidsWhile not recommended for the seriously ill, cannabis-based dietary supplements may ""help keep people healthy""Smoking marijuana will not provide protection against COVID-19 even though the plant contains acids that behave similarly to the vaccines developed to fight the virus, experts said.Researchers with the Global Hemp Innovation Center at Oregon State University said that a pair of acids found in cannabis — cannabigerolic acid, or CBG-A, and cannabidiolic acid, CBD-A — bond with the ""spike protein"" that the coronavirus uses to infect people, newspaper the Asbury Park Press reported.The protein is the same one targeted by COVID-19 vaccines and other therapies used to prevent serious illness from the virus, noted the outlet. ""The acids from hemp, could be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and also to shorten infections by preventing virus particles from infecting human cells,"" Dr. Richard van Breemen, the lead researcher of the study published in January, explained.However, smoking weed will not provide protection against COVID-19 as it would result in the CBG-A and CBD-A acids being destroyed, according to Dr. David Nathan, a psychiatrist with Princeton University. ""[I]f you smoke it, if you vape it, if you bake it into something, those compounds are actually gone,"" Nathan, who is also the founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, an advocacy group of medical professionals calling for the end of cannabis prohibition, said.Additionally, the study led by Breemen only tested on human cells in a laboratory and not real humans, unlike the COVID-19 vaccines.Many pharmaceutical treatments are reportedly proven ineffective when they transitioned from laboratory testing to human testing. ""Seeing something work in vitro is not the same as seeing it work in the human body,"" Breemen said.The research also used hemp, not marijuana.",Smoking marijuana will not provide protection against COVID-19,no,"

Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://fortune.com/2022/01/14/cannabis-covid-science-experts-weigh-in/," According to Silvia Martins, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, the findings from the cannabis study could be explored more, but everyone should be wary of similar hype. Thank you for not smoking
All the epidemiologists Fortune spoke with note that recreational cannabis in any form does not help in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. “During the COVID pandemic, you should absolutely not smoke, because that is the one thing you can do to make your lung function worse,” Sodergren notes. “We don’t treat patients for COVID with medical cannabis precisely for the fact that we don’t have any, any clinical evidence to suggest that it is beneficial.”
Robin Duncan, lead author of the University of Waterloo study that found CBD increases the innate antiviral system in cells, explicitly states recreational marijuana in either THC or CBD form do not help immunity against COVID. “I really urge people not to go out and start taking CBD gummies or oils,” he says.",does not help in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19,neutral,"

Can Hydroxychloroquine worsen COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-hydroxychloroquine-treat-covid-19," A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 821 participants suggests that the medication does not protect those at high risk of COVID-19 infection.The NIH were running a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using hydroxychloroquine to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19. However, the NIH halted the trial after the initial data suggested that the drug was no more effective than a placebo.What is the consensus?Overall, the findings from the above studies suggest that there is limited evidence for the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 23 studies investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 supports this view.The meta-analysis concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of the drug is both weak and conflicting.Potential risks and safety concernsTwo potential safety concerns about the use of hydroxychloroquine are heart health issues and interactions with other drugs.Heart health issuesIn some studies, people taking hydroxychloroquine have experienced a side effect known as QT prolongation. This is where the heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.QT prolongation may increase the possibility of irregular heartbeat, known as arrhythmia. Certain types of arrhythmia can increase the risk of stroke and sudden cardiac death. A preprint paper investigated the incidence of QT prolongation among people taking a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19.",there is limited evidence for the use of hydroxychloroquine,neutral,"

There are no known residual side effects for patients who received chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment under the emergency use authorization, as stated by the FDA. However, you should never self-treat for COVID-19 disease with hydroxychloroquine or any other drug. Hydroxychloroquine has not been proven helpful for COVID-19 and may lead to stomach or heart side effects, as well as serious drug interactions. On June 15, 2020 the FDA warned health care providers that the combined use of remdesivir (Veklury) and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended as it may result in reduced antiviral activity of remdesivir.",Hydroxychloroquine has not been proven helpful for COVID-19,neutral,"

ACE inhibitors reportedly increase levels of ACE-2 which is the protein that the SARs-CoV-2 virus binds to, and long-term use may also suppress the immune response. However, an overactive renin-angiotensin system may be another reason people with high blood pressure are more likely to develop pulmonary complications from COVID-19. There is currently no evidence that ACE inhibitors do make COVID-19 worse. But it is something that needs to be investigated further, to help guide practice during this current COVID-19 pandemic and for any new coronaviruses in the future that use ACE-2 as an entry point as well.

The panel concludes that using hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of experiencing side effects severe enough to stop taking the drug when compared with a placebo.People in the trials taking hydroxychloroquine had many more minor side effects, such as diarrhea and headaches, than those in the placebo group (56% vs. 6%). However, only marginally more people had side effects serious enough to stop taking the drug compared with a placebo.Reconsidering priorities and resourcesBased on these findings, the panel recommends that researchers shift their priority and resources to explore other medications.This new guideline could help uncover more effective COVID-19 therapies by focusing research efforts and funding on prevention and treatment options with more promising results. It may also bust the widespread myths and misconceptions that led to some people accessing or taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19 without medical advice.And this is good news given the long-list of adverse side effects associated with taking hydroxychloroquine unnecessarily. It could also be very good news for people with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, who need the medication to stay healthy and who have been facing drug shortages.The panel encourages researchers, doctors, and patients to check back for more information as they include new recommendations within the existing published document.This review is a good reminder that drugs showing promise in the laboratory and in initial observational, non-randomized human studies may not deliver the hoped-for results in well-conducted randomized trials.

The White House director of trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro, told CNN this week that the U.S. emergency stockpile is ""sitting on millions of doses"" of the drug.With little to no evidence supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine, the FDA commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said Thursday that it’s up to a patient’s doctor to decide.When asked whether patients should take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, Hahn acknowledged the potential harms. “We had data that when this drug was combined with others, there was some risk associated with that,” Hahn told NBC's ""TODAY"" show. “But the question you’re asking me is a decision between a doctor and a patient.”The interest in hydroxychloroquine began in March after a French scientist published a study showing that the drug in combination with azithromycin was an effective treatment for COVID-19. The study has since been widely debated, and the scientific society that published the study later admitted that the article did not meet its standards.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakIn early June, a study published by The Lancet showed hydroxychloroquine not only had no benefit but a potential for harm, but the study was retracted after concerns about the data.A slew of other research, however, has repeatedly concluded that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for the coronavirus, including results from three large randomized controlled trials.On June 5, the U.K. RECOVERY trial announced that the first randomized controlled trial on hydroxychloroquine had shown it to be ineffective for hospitalized patients.",harm,neutral,"

For people with COVID-19, the antibodies get into the circulation before the body can make its own antibodies, which gives a kick-start in fighting the virus. For those exposed but not yet infected, antibodies can be a line of defense that prevents the virus from gaining a foothold in the body. Anyone with COVID-19 at higher risk for progressing to severe disease is eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment. To receive monoclonal antibodies for treatment, you must have a positive test for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19 and be within 10 days of when your symptoms began.

Seronegative describes people whose blood serum tests revealed no antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.In an interview with Medical News Today (MNT), Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, TN, explained: “Once people are infected, […] these antibodies can be given […] by intravenous infusion, and they will latch onto the virus, preventing it, thereby, from infecting more of our cells. If the virus cannot do that, it cannot evolve into creating more serious disease; in other words, the good guys cut the bad guys off at the pass.”The WHO conditionally recommends treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for those with non-severe COVID-19 at the highest risk for hospitalization.

Can bleach prevent COVID-19?,https://www.science.org/content/article/does-disinfecting-surfaces-really-prevent-spread-coronavirus," Countless recommendations admonish us to wash our hands and disinfect often-touched surfaces in our homes. But what is the most effective way to prevent exposure to the virus? Like other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19, is thought to spread most commonly through invisible respiratory droplets sent into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Those droplets can then be inhaled by nearby people or land on surfaces that others then touch, who can then get infected when they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. The good news from investigations of the coronavirus spread, says Juan Leon, an environmental health scientist at Emory University, is that past studies show common household disinfectants, including soap or a diluted bleach solution, can deactivate coronaviruses on indoor surfaces.

Why you can trust Sky News


Americans trying to prevent COVID-19 infections have reported cleaning their food and themselves with disinfectant and bleach, with some even inhaling or drinking the household cleaning products, a study has found.According to research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly four in 10 people (39%) admitted to actions the health protection agency would consider dangerous. The study took place in May shortly after President Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat COVID-19. Image:

Of the 502 adults surveyed, 19% said they had put bleach on food, including fruit and vegetables, while 18% admitted using household cleaning and disinfectant products on their hands or skin.Some 4% had drank or gargled bleach solutions, soapy water or disinfectants, 6% had inhaled vapours from household cleaners or disinfectants, and 10% said they had misted their body with a cleaning or disinfectant spray. Health officials have cautioned explicitly against such behaviour.The online poll analysed household cleaning habits during the coronavirus pandemic. More on Covid-19

Even so, when outbreaks like COVID-19 occur and panic sets in, people rush to buy all sorts of chemical cleaners, many of which are unnecessary or ineffective against viruses.Foam hand sanitizers are disappearing from store shelves, even though many lack the necessary amount of alcohol—at least 60 percent by volume—to kill viruses. In countries hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, photos show crews in hazmat suits spraying bleach solutions along public sidewalks or inside office buildings. Experts are dubious, however, of whether that’s necessary to neutralize the spread of the coronavirus.Using bleach “is like using a bludgeon to swat a fly,” says Jane Greatorex, a virologist at Cambridge University.",ScienceCoronavirus CoverageWhy,neutral,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/breast-milk-could-help-treat-covid-19-and-protect-babies," This is good news because it opens the door to using breast milk from COVID-19-recovered mothers to treat critically ill babies or prevent severe illness in vulnerable infants. While our small study of 15 moms only gives us a snapshot of what is likely a dynamic immune response, it provides good reason to continue exploring the power of human milk to treat or prevent COVID-19 in infants. We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19. One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19. This suggests that breast milk may have some general immune properties that help babies fight COVID-19, even if mothers have never been infected with the disease.

In a recent study, researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine and University of California Los Angeles collaborated to find the answer.The study, published August 19, 2020 in the online edition of 
   JAMA, examined 64 samples of breast milk collected by the 
   Mommy’s Milk Human Milk Research Biorepository from 18 women across the United States infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

What we do know is that studies of mothers who had a similar virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; SARS-CoV) did not find the SARS virus in the mother’s milk. It’s important to understand that any virus that makes its way into the mother’s blood stream causes the mother to make very specific types of protection, called antibodies that fight these same viruses. These antibodies, once made, pass into the mother’s breast milk. So, in the unlikely event that the virus is transferred in the breast milk, these antibodies can help prevent infection.

As fears of the coronavirus continue to spread in the United States, some people have turned to unorthodox, unproven and even dangerous methods to attempt to ward off the disease. Now, rumors are spreading that breast milk could contain COVID-19 antibodies, but doctors say there's no evidence to support that claim. ""There's no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or give you antibodies,"" Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City's Gramercy Pediatrics, told CBSN's Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers on Tuesday. ""There's no data that I know of that has been published yet about it."" For years, people have been selling and buying human breast milk online for adult consumption, touting its supposed benefits as a ""superfood"" with immune-boosting properties.

In a recent study, researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine and University of California Los Angeles collaborated to find the answer.The study, published August 19, 2020 in the online edition of 
   JAMA, examined 64 samples of breast milk collected by the 
   Mommy’s Milk Human Milk Research Biorepository from 18 women across the United States infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

But getting an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy reduces these risks—and may provide some protection for breastfed babies as well. In this Q&A, Ruth Karron, MD, a pediatrician trained in infectious diseases, and Ruth Faden, PhD, MPH, an expert in biomedical ethics, answer some questions about the safety and concerns of getting vaccinated while breastfeeding and the benefits breast milk may provide to infants. Is it safe to breastfeed after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine? RK: From the time these vaccines were authorized back in January and February, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine made clear in all their publications that there was no reason to believe that there would be any problems associated with vaccinations and breastfeeding.

Their response: It’s not an outlandish idea, but it’s unlikely to do much good. There’s strong evidence that new mothers pass antibodies to protect against COVID-19 through breast milk. Several studies have shown that antibody levels in breast milk remain high for anywhere from six weeks to six months (and possibly even longer) after a mom is either infected with the coronavirus or vaccinated against COVID-19. In tests done in a petri dish, those breast milk antibodies successfully prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2.

The immune system is a marvel of evolution, and it is far from being fully understood. The newest immunological head-scratcher: Researchers have found that being vaccinated recently for something other than coronavirus — say, a hepatitis or measles vaccine — makes one more resistant to COVID-19. In an article published last month by the journal Scientific Reports, scientists found that a number of different vaccines were associated with lower rates of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. These included the vaccines for Geriatric Flu, Haemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), hepatitis A/hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella, pneumococcal conjugate, polio and Varicella. In particular, the patients studied who had been vaccinated against polio and HIB generally had the lowest relative risk for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 across all time horizons.",being vaccinated recently for something other than coronavirus,neutral,"

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/florida-governor-ron-desantis-bivalent-booster-infection/," Broadly speaking, COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection; they prevent the virus from spreading within the body and causing severe illness, according to John Hopkins University. Early CDC research shows that people who got the booster were 84% less likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19. The data collected on the booster’s ability to curb infection is early and limited; some clinical trials have shown that bivalent shots are no more equipped to prevent people from contracting COVID-19 than the original vaccines. Although some people have suggested the bivalent COVID-19 booster offers little protection against infection, DeSantis went further. He said people who received the bivalent booster shot were more susceptible to COVID-19 than those who hadn’t. The governor’s press office responded to PolitiFact’s inquiry about the claim shortly after publication, citing two articles and three studies, two of which are not yet peer reviewed.",do not prevent infection,no,"

""Compared to flu and HIV, this is going to be relatively easy to accomplish,"" he predicts. Earlier this year, Hannah Turner, a technician at Scripps Research who works with Ward, took a cold, hard look at a now infamous protein: SARS-CoV-2's spike, which enables the virus to infect cells and is at the heart of several successful COVID-19 vaccines. All coronaviruses have these spikes, which create the distinctive crownlike appearance that earned them their name, and most pancoronavirus vaccine efforts aim to rouse an immune response to some part of the spike protein. On this February morning, Turner mixes labmade copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike with ""broadly neutralizing"" antibodies harvested from COVID-19 patients. These antibodies powerfully prevent multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the original SARS virus, SARS-CoV, from infecting susceptible cells in test tube studies.",relatively easy to accomplish,neutral,"

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html," COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people by creating an immune response without the potentially severe illness or post-COVID conditions that can be associated with COVID-19 infection.

Understanding Impact of COVID-19 on Hib Vaccine Market


Published: Jun 26, 2020




Description: 

Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) is a bacterium which causes several diseases such as pneumonia, epiglottitis, meningitis, and sepsis mostly in children younger than 5 years
In infants and young children, Hib disease can cause serious health issues. Infection can spread to different parts of the body — including the brain, throat, spinal cord, and lungs. These infections can even cause serious implication on child’s health; they can be deadly. For example, Hib meningitis causes brain damage or hearing loss in 1 in 5 children who survive it. The Hib vaccine is the best way to protect the child from Hib disease
Two types of vaccines are available that can be used against Hib disease:
	
The Hib vaccine protects children and adults from Hib disease
The DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine protects babies ranging from 2 to 18 months from Hib disease, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio

Unfortunately, besides being extremely uncomfortable, using VapoRub in your nostrils puts you at risk of developing an extremely ominous-sounding illness called exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP), which results from the aspiration or inhalation of fat-like material of animal, vegetable or mineral origin. Long story short, the petrolatum base of VapoRub, when inhaled, can travel to the lungs, where it collects and causes ground-glass opacities — a type of damage also associated with COVID-19. If you’re feeling ill from any respiratory ailment, using VapoRub on your chest or in a vaporizer may soothe your symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also advise you on other methods to soothe congestion and body aches.

This rapid review set out to

Explore the possible mechanism of action of any effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on the disease course or severity of COVID-19. Synthesise any relevant proof of principle data available on the effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on COVID-19 or infection. Synthesise any relevant clinical data available, including observational data and clinical trials investigating acute administration of inhaled corticosteroids during COVID-19

Since the identification of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, the role of steroid therapy in the management of acute respiratory illnesses has been debated. Systemic steroid administration has dominated the scientific literature, with systemic dexamethasone recently having been shown to reduce the risk of COVID-19 mortality.1 Alongside, there has been consideration as to whether those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should continue to take their usual inhaled corticosteroid medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 or its effect on the SARS-CoV-2 virus is, however, limited. The pathogenesis of SARS involves the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells called macrophages in the lung alveoli.2 Steroids inhibit the adhesion and action of cytokines and it has been hypothesised that through such moderation of the immune response, inhaled corticosteroids could prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.2 We performed a rapid review of the literature to assimilate the current scientific data on this topic.",Explore the possible mechanism of action,neutral,"

Considering that aerosol therapy generates fugitive emissions that are not inhaled by the patient and are released from the device during expiration, several international professional bodies have provided recommendations for drug delivery via inhalers and in particular, nebulizers. Unfortunately, these recommendations are often in conflict with each other and do not clarify whether it is appropriate to use nebulizers during this COVID-19 pandemic. Considering what is available in literature, there are no known infection-related hazards to an uninfected patient and also a patient with COVID-19 that preclude the use of a nebulizer at home, but it fundamental that all patients, regardless of whether or not suffering from COVID-19, always follow some practical advices.

Studies have shown that higher expression of ACE2 is associated with smoking, diabetes and hypertension, all of which have been tied to increased COVID-19 severity.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists asthma as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. However, early case series from China did not include asthma and respiratory allergies as significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness.“We were surprised to learn that the COVID-19 pandemic in China did not seem to impact people with asthma as severely as we would’ve expected it to,” lead investigator Dr. Daniel Jackson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health said in a statement.“Knowing that other risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness like hypertension and obesity lead to increased ACE2 expression, we wanted to determine if patients with allergies and asthma could have reduced ACE2 gene expression as a potential explanation for this unexpected early finding from the outbreak,” he explained.The researchers analyzed data from three different cohorts of children and adults. In children, allergic sensitization was inversely correlated with ACE2 expression in nasal epithelium regardless of asthma status. In children with asthma, moderate and high allergic sensitization were associated with progressively greater reductions in ACE2 compared with children with no or minimal allergic sensitization.",did not seem to impact people with asthma,neutral,"

Brief Summary:
We hypothesize that inhaled steroid therapy and long acting beta 2 adrenergic agonist, widely prescribed in asthma patients, may also have a local protective effect against coronavirus infection, even in patients without asthma. The primary purpose is To compare time to clinical improvement in patients receiving standard of care associated to the combination budesonide/formoterol or standard of care only.",Protective Role of Inhaled Steroids,neutral,"

Can inhalers help COVID-19?,https://acaai.org/news/important-covid-19-information-for-those-with-asthma-and-or-allergies/," There is no clear evidence that patients with asthma are at any higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Asthma is an “underlying medical condition” that may be associated with more severe disease if you are infected with COVID-19. There is no evidence that asthma medications used to prevent symptoms (inhaled steroids, oral steroids, montelukast, biologics), etc. increase your risk of contracting COVID-19. If you become infected, use caution and avoid experimental treatments unless the treatment is specifically recommended by the physician caring for you.

    Treatments for COVID-19



February 2, 2023


What helps, what doesn't, and what's in the pipeline

Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19. Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19 in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness. Scientists continue working hard to develop other effective treatments.",Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33377319/," This results in disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death. Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/fish-oil-supplement-covid-6748800," Past studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation might be linked to better outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID. Hao Chen, an associate professor at the Department of Gastroenterology at Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital in China and an author of the study, told Verywell that “the results from previous studies on the association between fish oil supplements and COVID-19-related outcomes remain controversial.”



Specifically, Chen said that while past studies have suggested the protective role of fish oil supplements against COVID infection, “the statistical power of previous studies was limited, resulting from their defects of small sample sizes or insufficient study designs.”



The 4 Best Supplements for COVID


   Fish Oil: A Natural Way to Reduce COVID Symptoms? For the study, Chen and researchers at the Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences looked at whether taking omega-3 fatty acid-rich fish oil supplements was linked to better outcomes for people who got COVID. The researchers reviewed data on more than 110,000 adults in the UK Biobank cohort. They checked to see if the participants reported taking a fish oil supplement and also went over the results of their health exams at the start of the study. Over a 12-year follow-up, the researchers looked at the participants’ health.",omega-3 fatty acid supplementation might be linked to better outcomes,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://easyhealthoptions.com/higher-omega-3-levels-may-lower-covid-19-death-risk/," “While not meeting standard statistical significance thresholds, this pilot study — along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA — strongly suggests that these nutritionally available marine fatty acids may help reduce risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients,” says Dr. Arash Asher, lead author of the study. “Larger studies are clearly needed to confirm these preliminary findings.”
“An excessive inflammatory response, referred to as a ‘cytokine storm,’ is a fundamental mediator of severe COVID-19 illness,” observes Omega-3 expert Dr. James H. O’Keefe Jr., director of preventive cardiology at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Mo. “Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) have potent anti-inflammatory activities, and this pilot study provides suggestive evidence that these fatty acids may dampen COVID-19’s cytokine storm.”
The FARI research team is currently seeking funding to expand upon these preliminary observations. Best practices for obtaining omega-3s
This isn’t the first time we’ve written about omega-3s’ heroic abilities to save lives from the clutches of excess inflammation. In fact, omega-3s have been found to help heart attack survivors come out on top. A review of 40 separate clinical trials involving the consumption of both DHA and EPS showed that omega-3 intake reduced the risk of heart attack and coronary artery disease.",dampen COVID-19’s cytokine storm,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201201/Which-dietary-supplements-can-help-prevent-COVID-19.aspx," They also checked self-reported loss of smell (anosmia) in 993,365 regular app users on dietary supplements who had not been tested for the infection. Anosmia remains one of the strongest predictors of COVID-19, the researchers explained. Findings
Overall, the researchers found that:

Probiotics reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by 14 percent (8 to 19 percent range)
Omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by 12 percent (8 to 16 percent range)
Multivitamins reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by 13 percent (10 to 16 percent range)
Vitamin D reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by 9 percent (6 to 12 percent range)
Vitamin C, zinc or garlic supplements did not significantly reduce the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection

Next the team broke down the participant population into gender, age and body mass index (BMI) classes and found that probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins and vitamin D protected females of all ages and BMI from SARS-CoV-2. The same protection was not seen among men. Similar protective effects were noted for the American and Swedish populations as well. The next part of the study, which checked for protective effects of the supplements and anosmia among 993,365 regular app users, also showed a similar protective effect.",reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by 12 percent,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/lipids/potential-role-omega-3s-covid-19," EPA and DHA can work at the other end as well, preventing the initiation of an inflammatory response by making subtle changes to cell membrane architecture which, in very complex ways, serves to quiet cells and make them less responsive to inflammatory forces in the body.8 
Finally, the omega-3s EPA and DHA can also be converted into other compounds that oppose the actions of some of the pro-inflammatory compounds made from arachidonic acid, a major omega-6 fatty acid.9 Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index is a soothing balm to the body in general, calming down the body’s sometimes overly eager attempts to protect itself from infections and injury. Testing the Omega-3 Index with COVID-19
Knowing what omega-3s can do in cells is nice, but it’s much more important to know what they actually do in real life. Current ongoing studies are exploring whether supplementing people with omega-3 at the first signs of COVID-19 infection will help decelerate the disease and possibly save lives. Clinical studies take time, but other ways of exploring a potential link between omega-3 and COVID-19 exist, such as a recently published pilot study that has inspired optimism regarding omega-3s. The study was undertaken between research scientists at the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI) and physician scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Led by Arash Asher, M.D., the study took advantage of the fact that Cedars-Sinai—like many research institutions around the country—has a “biobank,” a place where leftover blood samples are stored from patients admitted to the hospital.",Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index,neutral,"

Fish oil (omega-3)When you think about battling COVID-19, a cold or the flu, fish is likely not the first food you think of eating. Perhaps that thinking needs to change. A recent review from the International Journal of Molecular Sciences notes that dietary omega-3 fatty acids actually promote specific immune responses.If you are a smoker, a habit that severely reduces the body's ability to fight COVID-19 and seasonal illness like cold and flu, you should quit. To help you along, you can use a healthy dose of fish oil every day as well.

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.chiroeco.com/omega-3-6-9/," One of these patients was from the group of 25 patients with omega 3 indices of greater than 5.7%, while the other 13 deaths came from the other three groups of patients with indices less than 5.7%.5
In running a statistical analysis, the researchers concluded that the 25 patients in the top group were 75% less likely to die than the 75 patients in the remaining three groups.5 This meant that patients with omega 3 indices lower than 5.7% were four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those with omega 3 indices above 5.7 %. The researchers speculated that omega 3’s ability to rapidly block inflammation signaling can stop the cytokine storm from building up, thereby preventing the acute respiratory distress that can lead to death in severe cases of COVID-19.5 As the lead researcher noted: “While not meeting standard statistical significance thresholds, this pilot study – along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA – strongly suggests that these nutritionally available marine fatty acids may help reduce risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.”
Taking omega 3-6-9 as part of a daily wellness routine to prevent chronic disease is always recommended. However, this new research indicates that people who are at increased risk of being hospitalized from COVID-19 may derive even more benefit from omega 3-6-9. References

April 19, 2021But protective effects seen only among women.Taking multivitamins, omega-3, probiotics, or vitamin D supplements may lessen the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infection — at least among women — indicates a large population study, published online in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.But taking any of vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements wasn’t associated with a lower risk of testing positive for the virus, the findings show.There has been plenty of celebrity endorsement of the use of dietary supplements to both ward off and treat COVID-19 infection since the start of the pandemic, note the researchers.In the UK alone, market share rose by 19.5% in the period leading up to the first national ‘lockdown’ on March 23 last year, with sales of vitamin C rising by 110% and those of multivitamins by 93%.Similarly, zinc supplement sales rose by 415% in the first week of March, at the height of COVID-19 fears in the USA.Dietary supplements can help to support a healthy immune system, but whether specific supplements might be associated with a lower risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 isn’t known.In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers drew on adult users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app to see if regular supplement users were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2.The app was launched in the UK, the US, and Sweden in March 2020 to capture self-reported information on the evolution of the pandemic.Initially, it recorded the location, age, and core health risk factors of its users. But as time went on, subscribers were asked to provide daily updates on a range of issues, including symptoms, coronavirus test results, and healthcare. People without obvious symptoms were also encouraged to use it.For the purposes of this study, the researchers analyzed information supplied by 372,720 UK subscribers to the app about their regular use of dietary supplements throughout May, June, and July 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic as well as any coronavirus swab test results.Between May and July,175,652 UK subscribers regularly took dietary supplements;197,068 didn’t. Around two thirds (67%) were women and over half were overweight (BMI of 27).In all, 23,521 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 349,199 tested negative between May and July.Taking probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, or vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection: by 14%, 12%, 13%, and 9%, respectively, after accounting for potentially influential factors, including underlying conditions and usual diet.No such effects were observed among those taking vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements.And when the researchers looked specifically at sex, age and weight (BMI), the protective associations for probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, and vitamin D were observed only in women of all ages and weights. No such clear associations were seen in men.Despite some differences, the same overall patterns were mirrored in both the US (45,757) and Swedish (27,373) subscribers.The equivalent figures for the US and Sweden were a reduced risk of:18% and 37%, respectively for probiotics; 21% and 16%, respectively, for omega-3 fatty acids; 12% and 22%, respectively for multivitamins; and 24% and 19%, respectively, for vitamin D supplements.This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause.",can’t establish cause,no,"

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA.",others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits,neutral,"

Some Studies Suggest Intravenous Immunoglobulin Could Help Treat COVID-19


Published: May 04, 2020

By Mark Terry




Researchers finding ways to use intravenous immunoglobulin for COVID-19 treatment. As researchers and physicians try to identify ways to effectively treat and prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, some are studying whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) could work. IVIg is a common blood plasma product that is used to treat other immune disorders. IVIg is purified from the mixed plasma of healthy people, with protein being the main component, which is abundant in bacterial antibodies and viral Immunoglobulin G (IgG). It is clinically used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by influenza, in addition to other immune disorders. There have now been several small studies of the use of IVIg in treating COVID-19.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109645," The benefit of IVIg in severe and critically ill COVID-19 is not well understood, however several studies suggest that it targets the post-infectious inflammatory response of the cytokine storm by scavenging complement, regulating effector T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and regulatory T-cells while inhibiting host innate immune cell activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Its action to reduce elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory markers of inflammation early in the course of COVID-19 illness is consistent with downregulation of the immune response. While current batches of IVIg may neutralize seasonal coronavirus species, it generally lacks cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [20]. Although passive virus neutralization appears to not be responsible for the beneficial effects of IVIg in treating COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 encodes one superantigen motif near its S1/S2 cleavage site that might trigger the cytokine storm [21]. As IVIg contains antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [22], IVIg might inhibit superantigen-mediated T-cell activation, cytokine release and an incipient cytokine storm. 3.",neutralize seasonal coronavirus species,neutral,"

The National Institutes of Health says it can neither recommend nor suggest against using ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, while the FDA strongly recommends against using the drug, particularly in the form designed to be used in animals.But the public has been slow to get the message. According to data from prescription savings service, SingleCare, there was a 1,126% increase in ivermectin prescriptions in January 2021 compared to a year earlier, and a 464% increase in February 2021 compared to February 2020. Interferons, immune proteins that modulate the response of the immune system to viruses, are crucial for mounting an immune response. The inhaled version of interferons was found to be quite effective for hospitalized patients.A study out late last year found some people with life-threatening COVID-19 had genetic quirks that left them interferon-deficient. But for those with normal gene function, adding interferons didn't seem to help.",The National Institutes of Health,neutral,"

At this point there is no proven effective therapy for COVID 19. There are a number of clinical trials ongoing. Social isolation is key in this setting. Anti-COVID 19 IgG will eventually make its way into IVIg materials, but this will take several years at a minimum. This is a very difficult problem.

It is now evident that in both adults and children COVID-19 causes severe inflammation of other organ systems in addition to the lungs, including the heart, brain and kidneys. The immunomodulatory mechanism of action of remestemcel-L may be beneficial in the treatment of ARDS as well as in involvement of other organ systems.Indeed, nine of 12 ventilator-dependent adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who received two doses of remestemcel-L under emergency compassionate use at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital were successfully discharged within a median of 10 days. Additionally, two COVID-19 infected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) who received remestemcel-L for severe heart failure fully recovered heart function and were discharged within 30 hours of the second dose.To confirm these pilot data, remestemcel-L is being evaluated for its potential to reduce mortality in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS. The dosing regimen in the Phase 3 is the same as in the pilot trial.

Can remestemcel-l cure COVID-19?,https://www.pcori.org/evidence-synthesis/horizon-scanning/covid-19-scan-april-29-may-12-2021," Early feedback from ECRI internal stakeholders suggested that remestemcel-L might provide a novel treatment for patients with COVID-19–induced ARDS, because of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions. Stakeholders expressed concerns about the failure of Remestemcel-L to reach its death-risk end points in the initial cohort of patients. However, the results shown in a prespecified subgroup analysis found remestemcel-L in combination with standard of care (dexamethasone) significantly reduced death rates in patients younger than 65 years. Stakeholders thought that, because many COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized fall into this age group, the treatment might have a substantial impact on patient health outcomes. The treatment might substantially reduce the burden on hospital resources and costs if the length of hospital stays is reduced and fewer intensive resources are needed. However, stakeholders were also concerned that, if expensive, treatment with remestemcel-L might increase disparities for individuals in need.",might provide a novel treatment,neutral,"

She’s pleased that the trial is in a category called expanded access, which means everyone in the trial gets the treatment. Nobody gets a placebo. “Being able to give this in addition to standard of care is huge because then it’s not as hard to decide if the child should be in the study or not.”
The remestemcel-L trial is one of several studies underway at MUSC focusing on COVID-19, including one testing a possible antibody treatment. Eckard is pleased to see that growing list include potential options for kids. “Hopefully, we won’t see many children with MIS-C, but you want to have good treatments for them.”

Can remestemcel-l cure COVID-19?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/remestemcel-l-treatment-covid-19-100000032.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall," Mesoblast expects this meeting will occur in November.Story continuesAdults with COVID-19 ARDSAs cases of COVID-19 surge in the United States and globally, deaths continue to increase from ARDS in ventilator-dependent patients as a result of an overactive immune response in the lungs to COVID-19. It is now evident that in both adults and children COVID-19 causes severe inflammation of other organ systems in addition to the lungs, including the heart, brain and kidneys. The immunomodulatory mechanism of action of remestemcel-L may be beneficial in the treatment of ARDS as well as in involvement of other organ systems.Indeed, nine of 12 ventilator-dependent adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who received two doses of remestemcel-L under emergency compassionate use at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital were successfully discharged within a median of 10 days. Additionally, two COVID-19 infected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) who received remestemcel-L for severe heart failure fully recovered heart function and were discharged within 30 hours of the second dose.To confirm these pilot data, remestemcel-L is being evaluated for its potential to reduce mortality in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS. The dosing regimen in the Phase 3 is the same as in the pilot trial. Trial enrollment across more than 20 hospitals in the United States has surpassed 50% of the total 300 patient target.",reduce mortality,neutral,"

Mesoblast’s technology focuses on proprietary mesenchymal lineage adult stem cells (MLCs) found in multiple tissues where they play a role in maintaining tissue health. They are rare cells originating around the blood vessels that respond to signals linked to tissue damage, and which secrete molecules that promote tissue repair and modulate immune responses. Remestemcel-L is believed to counteract the inflammatory processes in inflammatory conditions by down-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The safety and efficacy of the therapy has been evaluated in more than 1,100 patients in several clinical trials, including the successful Phase III trial for steroid-refractory aGVHD in children. A post-hoc analysis of a study in 60 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) showed the therapy significantly improved respiratory function in patients with the same elevated inflammatory biomarkers seen in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Fred Grossman, the company’s chief medical officer, stated, “There is a significant need to improve the dismal survival outcomes in COVID-19 patients who progress to ARDS and require ventilators.",improves survival,neutral,"

Can remestemcel-l cure COVID-19?,https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/news/152943/remestemcel-l-reduces-ards-mortality-in-those-under-65-years-old/," Additionally, remestemcel-L reduced mortality by 75 percent and increased days alive off mechanical ventilation in patients under age 65 when combined with dexamethasone, in comparison with controls on dexamethasone.“Reduction in mortality in mechanically ventilated patients under 65 years old remains a critical unmet need since as many as 72 percent of currently hospitalised patients across the US with COVID-19 are in this age category,” commented Mesoblast Chief Executive, Silviu Itescu. “This is similar to other causes of viral ARDS such as influenza where 70-80 percent of patients in intensive care units are under 65. The reduction in mortality seen with remestemcel-L in this age group highlights the potential to make a meaningful difference in the treatment of diseases of excessive inflammation.”The trial enrolled 222 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with moderate/severe ARDS, of whom 217 were randomised 1:1 to receive either standard of care (SOC) alone or SOC plus two intravenous infusions of remestemcel-L three to five days apart at a dose of two million cells/kg.According to the company, the way in which the pandemic evolved during the course of the trial, particularly with regards to the patient pool becoming progressively older with comorbidities and refractory to treatment, may have impacted the outcome of the third interim analysis which resulted in the trial’s early conclusion.It added that to achieve mortality reduction in patients over 65 with comorbidities would likely require a different dosing regimen than that which may be effective in patients under 65.Key findings in the trialRemestemcel-L reduced mortality by 46 percent through day 60 in the pre-specified population of 123 treated patients under age 65 years of age: 26 percent reduction in mortality for SOC where SOC plus remestemcel-L was 42 percent. The effect on mortality was found to be similar whether the patients had moderate or severe ARDS.Standard of care changed during the trial to incorporate dexamethasone, with only two percent of the first 50 patients enrolled receiving dexamethasone compared with 84 percent of the subsequent 172 patients; this allowed for additional exploratory analyses of remestemcel-L treatment effects in patients who received dexamethasone as part of SOC:Remestemcel-L reduced mortality through day 60 by 75 percent compared to controls in patients under 65 who received dexamethasone as part of their SOC (14 versus 45 percent respectively for SOC and SOC plus remestemcel-L)Remestemcel-L increased days alive off ventilator within 60 days and reduced time to discharge from initial hospitalisation compared to controls in patients under 65 who received dexamethasone as part of their SOC“The mortality benefit observed with remestemcel-L in ventilator-dependent patients younger than 65, particularly in combination with dexamethasone, has the potential to change the treatment regimen in this critical patient population,” said Dr Fred Grossman, Chief Medical Officer of Mesoblast. “As cases continue to surge in younger patients across the US, we plan to meet with the [US Food and Drug Administration] FDA to discuss next steps in the regulatory process.”The company added that additional secondary endpoints, which include days in intensive care and cardiac, neurological and pulmonary organ damage, together with measures of circulating cytokines and inflammatory markers, are being evaluated and will be reported when completed.Ampion™ reduces COVID-19 respiratory distress mortality…Related topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Development, Drug Safety, Research & Development (R&D), Therapeutics, VirusesRelated organisationsMesoblast Limited, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Related drugsdexamethasone, Remestemcel-LRelated peopleDr Fred Grossman, Silviu ItescuRelated diseases & conditionsAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Coronavirus, Covid-19              By Hannah Balfour (European Pharmaceutical Review)4 May 2021No comments yetShares19             Share via  Pinterest Reddit Buffer Xing WhatsApp FlipboardRelated topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Development, Drug Safety, Research & Development (R&D), Therapeutics, VirusesRelated organisationsMesoblast Limited, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Related drugsdexamethasone, Remestemcel-LRelated peopleDr Fred Grossman, Silviu ItescuRelated diseases & conditionsAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Coronavirus, Covid-19                  Most popular...FDA approves first BTK inhibitor for lymphomaCHMP meeting highlights – January 2023Monoclonal antibody could prevent malaria, study showsFirst medicine approved in EU for eosinophilic esophagitisNew UK point of care manufacturing regulatory framework

Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases; that's why some people have been naturally worried about mosquitoes carrying SARS-CoV-2.

For a mosquito to become infected with a virus, it must be present in the blood the mosquito feeds on.

Key Takeaways

A new study from Kansas State University shows that mosquitoes are not vectors for COVID-19.You should still protect yourself against mosquitoes, because they are currently carriers of dangerous diseases like West Nile and EEE. According to a new study from Kansas State University, mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, published in Scientific Reports on July 17, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 cannot reproduce within mosquitoes and cannot be transmitted to humans through a bite.﻿﻿﻿



The World Health Organization (WHO) previously stated that “there has been no evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes."" Scientists Urge WHO to Update Guidelines

A big concern many have had during the pandemic (especially during warmer months) has been if mosquitoes can spread the coronavirus. With malaria being the most well-known, mosquitoes are notorious spreaders of viral illnesses (such as the EEE outbreak from last summer). Researchers, however, have determined that mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it has no data to support coronavirus transmission via mosquito bite, and, similarly, the World Health Organization said bites will not pass along the virus. Researchers have said that in order for mosquitoes to be able to pass the virus along to a human, the mosquito would first have to become infected with the coronavirus and have it replicate within it.

Their results align with numerous studies conducted thus far. “The answer is none of these seem to support SARS-CoV-2 replication,” says Richt, Regents Distinguished Professor of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University and Director of KSU’s Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (CEZID). “So, we think that these species are unable to be biological vectors of SARS-CoV-2.”

It's extremely unlikely mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19 according to entomology professor




















By: Emma Ea Ambrose 










April 21, 2020






















“There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes,” Catherine Hill, professor of entomology and vector biology, said. In the swells of information that have surrounded the COVID-19 pandemic, Hill said one question that keeps popping up is whether animals, including mosquitoes, can infect humans with the virus. Scientists around the world are currently assessing if  mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission but, so far, there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitos are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), in this family are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said.",It’s extremely unlikely,neutral,"

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.rd.com/article/can-mosquitoes-transmit-coronavirus/," Still, it's important to take measures to prevent mosquito bites. ⓘ
Mosquitoes are known to transmit many diseases, including Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue fever, and others, but COVID-19 is likely not on this list. At this point, there’s nothing to suggest that mosquitoes can transmit coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, and the main mode of transmission is via viral droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes without a face mask. Here are 6 places you’re most likely to catch coronavirus. “A mosquito can ingest a pathogen such as a viral particle which then travels to its stomach,” explains Yesim Tozan, PhD, assistant professor of global health at NYU School of Global Public Health in New York City.",COVID-19 is likely not on this list,neutral,"

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a33310640/can-mosquitoes-transmit-novel-coronavirus/," After all mosquitoes can transmit viruses like Zika virus, West Nile, and dengue fever, so…can mosquitoes transmit novel coronavirus? Before you panic thinking about what could happen, know this: It’s not likely. The World Health Organization (WHO) actually addresses this in a “mythbusters” section on its website. “To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the WHO says online. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that spreads mostly through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes—or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, the organization explains—not through the bite of an infected mosquito. ""People ask this all the time,"" says infectious disease expert John A.

The pathogens mosquitoes spread by sucking our blood cause over half a million deaths each year and hundreds of millions of cases of severe illness. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest mosquitoes are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the coronavirus but based on current understandings, it’s highly unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus by biting an infected person, let alone be able to pass it on.

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q2/its-extremely-unlikely-mosquitoes-can-transmit-covid-19-purdue-professor-says.html," Scientists around the world are currently assessing if mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission, but so far there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitoes are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses in this family, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said. Hill has a few messages to help inform and allay fears:

While research is still ongoing into primary routes of transmission, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a “respiratory virus” and is primarily transmitted by “aerosol” route; sneezing/coughing and touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your face. Although it has been detected at low levels in the blood, there is no evidence it can be transmitted via bite from a mosquito.",it is extremely unlikely mosquitoes are able to transmit the virus,no,"

Mosquitoes are known to transmit many diseases, including Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue fever, and others, but COVID-19 is likely not on this list. At this point, there’s nothing to suggest that mosquitoes can transmit coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, and the main mode of transmission is via viral droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes without a face mask. Here are 6 places you’re most likely to catch coronavirus. “A mosquito can ingest a pathogen such as a viral particle which then travels to its stomach,” explains Yesim Tozan, PhD, assistant professor of global health at NYU School of Global Public Health in New York City.",COVID-19 is likely not on this list,neutral,"

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. ""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry,"" the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible.

CORONAVIRUSIsopropyl alcoholCoronavirushand sanitizerHow To Make Your Own Disinfectant To Kill CoronavirusYou may already have some of the necessary ingredients for DIY wipes and sprays that eliminate COVID-19 (and no, vodka is not one of them).By Casey BondMoney, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPostApr 14, 2020, 07:45 PM EDTThese days, even clean freaks are getting a run for their money. In order to keep the coronavirus at bay, it’s important to disinfect your kitchen, bathrooms ― even the air ― sometimes multiple times per day. But with the recent panic-buying that’s wiped store shelves clean of commercial disinfectants, you might not have the usual products on hand.Fortunately, you can make DIY hand sanitizer, disinfecting spray and wipes. Here’s what you need to know about making your own cleaning products that kill the coronavirus.Advertisement

Items You’ll NeedThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting your home that are crucial to follow when making your own disinfectants. For example, the CDC says that it’s important to use EPA-registered disinfectants that have been vetted for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and allow enough contact time on the surface for the disinfectant to work.There are just a handful of solutions you need for DIY cleaning products, according to Dean Davies, cleaning supervisor for Fantastic Services, which specializes in antiviral sanitization.",vodka is not one of them,no,"

Ribavirin







Last review completed on
April 19th, 2020


Therapy Description
Activity of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 has been demostrated in vitro (Wang 2020), although it was found to be 100-fold less potent than remdesivir and chloroquine. This may suggest the challenge of narrow therapeutic window for ribavirin. A mouse study (Barnard 2006) of SARS-CoV-1 had demonstrated higher levels of virus in lungs in those treated with ribavirin compared to no treatment. Treatment with interferon-α2b and ribavirin in macaques infected with MERS-CoV (Falzarano 2013) showed benefit of this combination. Combination of LPV/r and ritonavir demonstrated synergy in vitro against SARS-CoV-1 and clinical benefit in patients treated with combination compare to ribavirin alone in historical controls (Chu 2004). Review (Stockman 2006) reported most human clinical studies were inconclusive and some showed harm of ribavirin in treating SARS-CoV-1.",Ribavirin,neutral,"

Can Ribavirin help COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-3-drug-combo-treatment-may-be-successful," The team randomly assigned 86 of the participants to a group that received the combination and 41 of the participants to a control group.In the combination group, participants took a combination of “lopinavir 400 [milligrams (mg)] and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 [hours], ribavirin 400 mg every 12 [hours], and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days.” The treatment lasted for 14 days. In the control group, participants took lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours, also for 14 days. Combination may ‘rapidly suppress’ virusThe results revealed that the three-drug combination was safe and more efficient than lopinavir-ritonavir in relieving COVID-19 symptoms, reducing the period of viral shedding, and shortening the length of hospital stays. Specifically, nasopharyngeal swabs showed that the average time before the virus cleared was 7 days in the combination group, compared with 12 days in the control group. Side effects across both groups included nausea — which resolved with no intervention — and diarrhea, with no difference between the two groups. “Our trial demonstrates that early treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with a triple combination of antiviral drugs may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body, relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk to healthcare workers by reducing the duration and quantity of viral shedding (when the virus is detectable and potentially transmissible).” — Lead researcher Prof. Kwok-Yung Yuen, University of Hong Kong “Furthermore, the treatment combination appeared safe and well-tolerated,” adds Prof. Yuen.Trial strengths and limitationsHowever, Prof. Yuen also warns that “[d]espite these encouraging findings, we must confirm in larger phase III trials that interferon beta-1b alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in patients with more severe illness (in whom the virus has had more time to replicate).” Dr. Jenny Lo, from Ruttonjee Hospital in Hong Kong, echoes this sentiment.",relieving COVID-19 symptoms,neutral,"

Triple Antiviral Combo May Speed COVID-19 Recovery


Neil Osterweil
May 11, 2020









 Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's   Coronavirus Resource Center. A triple-antiviral therapy regimen of interferon-beta1, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin shortened median time to COVID-19 viral negativity by 5 days in a small trial from Hong Kong. In an open-label, randomized phase 2 trial in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 infections, the median time to viral negativity by nasopharyngeal swab was 7 days for 86 patients assigned to receive a 14-day course of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 hours, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days, compared with a median time to negativity of 12 days for patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (P = .0010), wrote Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung, MD, from Gleaneagles Hospital in Hong Kong, and colleagues. ""Triple-antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were safe and superior to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding, alleviating symptoms, and facilitating discharge of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,"" they wrote in a study published online in The Lancet. Patients who received the combination also had significantly shorter time to complete alleviation of symptoms as assessed by a National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2, a system for detecting clinical deterioration in patients with acute illnesses) score of 0 (4 vs. 8 days, respectively; hazard ratio 3.92, P < .0001), and to a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 0 (3 vs. 8 days, HR 1.89, P = .041).

This stops certain antiviral drugs like ribavirin from being effective. Fortunately, the coronavirus’ proofreading powers don’t block a similar drug, remdesivir. So remdesivir potently halts coronavirus replication and represents a promising drug option for COVID-19 patients.

Can Ribavirin help COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-020-00019-9," A randomized open-label trial in China of some 200 hospitalized patients did not find the drug combination to be more effective than standard care, but further clinical trials are pending. According to the review in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the drugs may have limited appeal because of side effects, most notably increased nausea and diarrhea and increased risk for liver damage, all of which could exacerbate the signs of COVID-19. In a randomized controlled study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, there was no association between treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 with lopinavir–ritonavir and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load or significant clinical benefit. Another trial on people with mild COVID-19 shows reduced time of viral shedding, reduced time to alleviation of symptoms and reduced hospital stay in a group with lopinavir, ritonavir, IFN-B and ribavirin, as compared to a group receiving lopinavir and ritonavir alone.Nafamostat and camostatNafamostat and camostat are serine protease inhibitors both approved in Japan for use against pancreatitis in humans. Camostat was previously found in vitro to block the entry of SARS-CoV by acting as an antagonist to the serine protease TMPRSS2, and researchers believe both nafamostat and camostat could have a similar effect in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. In vitro, both have been found to block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, although one preprint study reported that nafamostat inhibited viral cell entry with an efficiency roughly 15-fold higher than that of camostat.These drugs are undergoing phase 2 and phase 2/3 clinical trials in the USA and Japan for their effectiveness against COVID-19, the primary outcome of which will be time to clinical improvement for nafamostat and reduced viral load after treatment for camostat.“These drugs are quite old, they’re well studied, they have known targets that are exactly the same protease that the virus uses,” says Anton Yuryev, professional services director at Elsevier, who has done screenings for possible COVID-19 drug treatments.FamotidineThe over-the-counter H2 receptor antagonist heartburn medication famotidine is also been investigated as a possible treatment, after Michael Callahan and colleagues in China reported that patients in Wuhan who happened to be taking heartburn medication seemed less likely to die from or to be intubated during severe COVID-19.",reduced hospital stay,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      


      
      The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prompted investigators worldwide to search for an effective anti-viral treatment. A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs.",A number of anti-viral drugs,neutral,"

Since the beginning of the pandemic there’s been a lot of talk about which dietary supplements and vitamins can help reduce the risk of Covid-19 or treat the virus. Headlines and celebrities talked about how supplements like vitamin C, zinc, green tea and echinacea boost the immune system and protect against the virus. But while dietary supplements can help to support a healthy immune system, whether specific supplements might be associated with a lower risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 isn't really known. Regardless, supplement sales soared last year. In the U.S. during the first week of the pandemic sales of dietary supplements skyrocketed to more than 35%.

Transcript








Historically tobacco plants are responsible for their share of illness and death. But two companies are using the plants to produce proteins for a vaccine. One candidate vaccine is in clinical trials. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Companies trying to make a vaccine for COVID-19 are trying a variety of approaches. Most involve laboratories capable of sophisticated biotechnology, but NPR's Joe Palca has this report about one approach for creating a vaccine which starts in a greenhouse.JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Vaccines essentially work by tricking the immune system into thinking it's seen a virus so it can fight it off if the real McCoy ever shows up.

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy

The idea is that alkalizing your body (by drinking juice or lemon water, which is acidic in its natural state) creates a less appealing environment for the novel coronavirus. But, unfortunately, the logic is wrong. According to WebMD, there’s no evidence that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or any other means does anything for coronavirus. In fact, it’s even contrary to medical science. With no specific treatment for COVID-19, getting into good habits and strengthening your immunity against viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, by drinking warm lemon water may help reduce your risk of contracting the disease.",With no specific treatment,neutral,"

In the case of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease Covid-19, BBC Future has already examined how drinking water doesn’t offer any protection against the new coronavirus. The virus cannot simply be washed away by drinking water or gargling liquid regularly. While it can enter the body through the nose and mouth in tiny droplets coughed out by other people who are infected, it primarily tends to infect cells of the respiratory tract. These cells carry an enzyme on their surface that the virus needs in order to get inside them. Inhaling these droplets will transport them down towards the lungs – away from anywhere that can be reached by a mouthful of liquid.Guzzling down hot liquid is unlikely to raise the temperature enough in your respiratory tract to kill any of the virus inside the cells thereOnce inside the body, the virus also quickly gets inside the cells of its human host where it then slowly replicates itself, meaning it is also able to comfortably hide from any attempts to wash it away.",drinking water doesn’t offer any protection,no,"
