Can crystals heal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/healing-crystals-what-they-can-do-and-what-they-cant," One common belief is that crystals interact with the body’s energy fields, also known as vibrational energy. The idea is that crystals can redirect and re-channel energy flow with their unique energetic vibrations, helping to unblock areas of the body or energy field that have become “stuck.”“Crystals have potent healing powers, and when we touch them, healing is immediately activated,” says cosmic energy healer Eva Antoniadou. As the crystal vibrations interact with the body’s natural energetic frequency, the body is said to be left feeling focused, relaxed, and clear. “Crystals absorb energy from pressure and movement and convert it into an electronic frequency,” says Polack. “It’s this frequency, unique to each type of crystal, that users are relying on when working with crystals, and given that many pain and anxiety relief devices work on similar principles, we do believe they can help in these areas.”Methods of treating pain and other disorders with electrical current include:radiofrequency ablation (RFA)electronic muscle stimulation (EMS)transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Compared to these therapies, any frequency a crystal might emit would be infinitesimal.

But despite the fact that crystal healing has seen an upsurge in popularity in recent years, this alternative treatment is not popular with most medical doctors and scientists, many of whom refer to crystal healing as a pseudoscience. Scientifically speaking, there is no evidence that crystal healing can be used to cure diseases, because diseases have never been found to be the result of a so-called energy flow in the body. Furthermore, no scientific studies have shown that crystals and gems can be differentiated by chemical composition or color to treat a particular ailment.

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet," Why has there been concern that cell phones may cause cancer? There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems: Cell phones emit radiation (in the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones would be of concern given how many people use them. Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health.

NTP scientists had exposed thousands of rats and mice (whose biological similarities to humans make them useful indicators of human health risks) to doses of radiation equivalent to an average mobile user’s lifetime exposure.The peer review scientists repeatedly upgraded the confidence levels the NTP’s scientists and staff had attached to the study, fuelling critics’ suspicions that the NTP’s leadership had tried to downplay the findings. Thus the peer review also found “some evidence” – one step below “clear evidence” – of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands.Not one major news organisation in the US or Europe reported this scientific news.

The Truth About Cell Phones and Cancerby Berkeley Scientificin 2018on Posted on March 19, 2018February 28, 2022


By Andrea He
Cell phones are now a constant fixture in our lives that we cannot live without. However, the ways that cell phone radiation could harm our bodies are still not solidified, but new evidence from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the recent announcement from the California Department of Public Health regarding the possible dangers of cell phones could start making us view our tech companions as something more malicious. The new NIH studies by the National Toxicology Program found that cell phone usage can actually be linked to certain types of cancer. In a multimillion dollar research study, 3,000 rodents were exposed to radiation levels similar to those allowed for current cell phone emissions and their health levels were tracked. (too spiecifcs) The rodents were split into two groups, one with lower radiation levels (highest level permitted for cell phones) and another one with higher radiation levels. They were monitored over a two-year period.",cell phone usage can actually be linked to certain types of cancer,yes,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/01/health-risks-of-cell-phone-radiation/," However, since I was dubious that cellphone radiation could cause cancer, I immersed myself in the literature regarding the biological effects of low-intensity microwave radiation, emitted by cellphones and other wireless devices. After reading many animal toxicology studies that found that this radiation could increase oxidative stress — free radicals, stress proteins and DNA damage — I became increasingly convinced that what we were observing in our review of human studies was indeed a real risk. While Myung and his colleagues were visiting the Center for Family and Community Health, you reviewed case-control studies examining the association between mobile phone use and tumor risk. What did you find? Our 2009 review, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found that heavy cellphone use was associated with increased brain cancer incidence, especially in studies that used higher quality methods and studies that had no telecommunications industry funding. Last year, we updated our review, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, based on a meta-analysis of 46 case-control studies — twice as many studies as we used for our 2009 review — and obtained similar findings.",cellphone radiation could cause cancer,yes,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11577482/," However, the lack of ionizing radiation and the low energy level emitted from cell phones and absorbed by human tissues make it unlikely that these devices cause cancer. Moreover, several well-designed epidemiologic studies find no consistent association between cell phone use and brain cancer. It is impossible to prove that any product or exposure is absolutely safe, especially in the absence of very long-term follow-up. Accordingly, the following summary from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health offers advice to people concerned about their risk: If there is a risk from these products--and at this point we do not know that there is--it is probably very small. But if people are concerned about avoiding even potential risks, there are simple steps they can take to do so. People who must conduct extended conversations in their cars every day could switch to a type of mobile phone that places more distance between their bodies and the source of the RF, since the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance.",unlikely that these devices cause cancer,neutral,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html," Because cell phones usually are held near the head when a person is on a call, the main concern has been whether the phones might cause or contribute to tumors in this area, including:

Malignant (cancerous) brain tumors, such as gliomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the brain, such as meningiomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the nerve connecting the brain to the ear (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas)
Tumors of the salivary glands

A few studies have also looked at possible links to other types of cancer. What do studies show? Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to determine if something might cause cancer:

Studies done in the lab (using lab animals or cell cultures)
Studies looking at groups of people

In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own to show if something causes cancer in people, so researchers usually look at both lab-based and human studies.

Mild headaches: Having a mild headache is considered a moderate reaction to a mosquito bite, normally appearing in those who have a weakened immune system. You can experience slight pain or tension, but it is not usually persistent and can be relieved used conventional painkillers or home solutions. If your headache intensifies or is prolonged, it might be a sign of a more serious illness and you should consult your doctor as soon as possible


Low fever: A mild or low fever is a symptom that can sometimes occur, normally when the immune system is struggling to fight off an invasive pathogen. You might find that your temperature is slightly, but not alarmingly, higher than usual. This symptom should begin to diminish within a few days but if it persists or worsens, you should speak to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a more serious, mosquito-borne illness.

Mosquitoes then can transmit it from birds to humans or horses, for example. The virus got its name because it was first recognized in horses in 1831 in the northeastern United States, according to the American Association of Blood Banks. Scientists identified it in humans in 1938, following a widespread outbreak in children that resulted in 30 cases of fatal encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain usually caused by a viral infection).“On the good news side, the virus is still relatively rare, and a very, very small proportion of mosquitoes are actually infected,” says Rich. “That’s not to say don't worry about it, but do not let this rule your life.”RELATED: Why Mosquito Bites Itch and How to Get ReliefHow To Protect YourselfAlthough infected mosquitoes spreading EEE are not a health threat on par with the coronavirus, health officials recommend that individuals and communities take action now to head off trouble.Because mosquitoes often breed in standing, stagnant fresh water, Rich suggests that people empty out any planters, old tires, bird baths, old toys, or other receptacles that may be holding water.Dr.",YourselfAlthough infected mosquitoes spreading EEE are not a health threat,neutral,"

Prevention & Screening








While most cancers occur sporadically, and are caused by gene changes that happen during your lifetime, approximately 5 to 10% of all cancers are due to an inherited genetic change, called a mutation, to specific genes. These mutations can be passed from parents to children, generation after generation, and result in a higher risk for developing certain types of cancers. Genetic testing can help determine whether or not you carry a mutation in one of the genes associated with cancer. Am I at risk? You may suspect a hereditary cancer risk if your personal or family medical history includes one or more of the following:
Family members with multiple primary cancers, two or more new cancers (not one that has spread) such as both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Two or more relatives with the same cancer type on the same side of the family.",approximately 5 to 10% of all cancers are due to an inherited genetic change,yes,"

Some cancers can indeed be caused by genetic mutations that are hereditary, increasing the risk that many family members will develop the disease.

"
Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/genetics/family-cancer-syndromes.html," But cancer can sometimes be caused by an abnormal gene that is passed from generation to generation. Although these cancers are often referred to as inherited cancers, what is actually inherited is the abnormal gene that can lead to cancer, not the cancer itself. Only about 5% to 10% of all cancers are known to be strongly linked to gene defects (called mutations) inherited from a parent. To learn about the role of genes and how mutations can lead to cancer, see Genes and Cancer. How do you recognize an inherited or family cancer syndrome? Certain things make it more likely that cancers in a family are caused by a family cancer syndrome, such as:

Many cases of the same type of cancer (especially if it is an uncommon or rare type of cancer)
Cancers occurring at younger ages than usual (like colon cancer in a 20-year-old)
More than one type of cancer in a single person (like a woman with both breast and ovarian cancer)
Cancers occurring in both of a pair of organs (like both eyes, both kidneys, or both breasts)
More than one childhood cancer in siblings (like sarcoma in both a brother and a sister)
Cancer occurring in the sex not usually affected (like breast cancer in a man)
Cancer occurring in many generations (like in a grandfather, father, and son)

If you have any of the above hereditary syndromes, you may also be at an increased risk of developing other types of cancers besides RCC.Comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and smoking, may also increase your risk of developing kidney cancer.How is inherited kidney cancer diagnosed?Inherited kidney cancer is diagnosed similarly to sporadic cases of this cancer, except that you will also require genetic testing.Besides a genetic screening, you can expect a combination of the following steps as part of a kidney cancer diagnosis:a physical exama detailed look into your health historyurinalysisblood chemistry studiesimaging tests, such as ultrasound or MRI scansa biopsy to get a sample of a kidney massbone scans or chest X-rays, if your doctor thinks the cancer has spreadCan inherited kidney cancer be prevented?Having an inherited gene mutation doesn’t mean you’ll definitely develop kidney cancer.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited or arise from certain environmental exposures. Genetic changes can also happen because of errors that occur as cells divide. Most often, cancer-causing genetic changes accumulate slowly as a person ages, leading to a higher risk of cancer later in life. Cancer cells can break away from the original tumor and travel through the blood or lymph system to distant locations in the body, where they exit the vessels to form additional tumors. This is called metastasis. Types of Genes that Cause Cancer

Can cancer be inherited?,https://health.uconn.edu/medical-genetics/hereditary-cancer-program/what-is-hereditary-cancer/," Damaged cancer susceptibility genes can be inherited, and passed on, by men just as easily as women. If a parent carries a cancer susceptibility gene, each of their children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene, and thus the susceptibility to cancer. Each child also has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the working copy of the gene, in which case their cancer risk would be no higher than that of the general population. It should be noted that some cancer susceptibility genes only have links to cancers that may not be seen in both sexes, such as ovarian and prostate cancers. Parents of the unaffected sex can still carry and pass on these genes.

So, is cancer genetic? In about 5% to 10% of cases, inherited genetic mutations are indeed at the root of increased cancer risk.﻿﻿﻿ These are known as hereditary cancer syndromes or germline mutations. Sometimes, cancer can appear to “run in your family” when in fact a lifestyle or environmental factor that's shared by family members may be the culprit, such as a smoking habit. Certain signs in your family’s medical history may indicate that you have inherited cancer risk. These include:



Cancer in many generations (like a grandmother, mother, and daughter)Multiple cases of the same type of cancer, especially if it is uncommon or rare Cancer at younger ages than usualChildhood cancer in siblingsMore than one type of cancer in a single personCancer in a pair of organs (such as both eyes, breasts, or kidneys)Cancer in the sex typically not affected (like male breast cancer)

Concerns about vaccines leading to autism surfaced in 1999 and initially involved the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Because the MMR vaccine is usually given at age 12 to 15 months, and the first signs of autism often appear at this time, concerns were raised about a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism.

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are serious multisystem developmental disorders and an urgent global public health concern. Dysfunctional immunity and impaired brain function are core deficits in ASD. Aluminum (Al), the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, is a demonstrated neurotoxin and a strong immune stimulator. Hence, adjuvant Al has the potential to induce neuroimmune disorders. When assessing adjuvant toxicity in children, two key points ought to be considered: (i) children should not be viewed as ""small adults"" as their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to toxic insults; and (ii) if exposure to Al from only few vaccines can lead to cognitive impairment and autoimmunity in adults, is it unreasonable to question whether the current pediatric schedules, often containing 18 Al adjuvanted vaccines, are safe for children? By applying Hill's criteria for establishing causality between exposure and outcome we investigated whether exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence in the Western world.",exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence,yes,"

None. So why are so many people still choosing not to vaccinate? First, there is the unfortunate coincidence that warning signs of autism—not responding to their name, not babbling, little eye contact—often become obvious around the same time that infants get a hefty round of vaccinations, especially around their first birthday.

Claims that vaccines cause autism have led some parents to delay or refuse vaccines for their children. The most common claims are that autism is caused by MMR vaccine, vaccines that contain thimerosal, or too many vaccines. Many 
        scientific studies have been done to test these claims. None has shown 
        any correlation between vaccines and autism. Autism Resources

Can baking soda help to cure cancer?,https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/baking-soda," The findings are complicated.There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer. It’s important to remember that cancer grows quite well in healthy tissue with normal pH levels. Additionally, naturally acidic environments, like the stomach, don’t encourage cancer growth.Once cancer cells begin to grow, they produce an acidic environment that encourages malignant growth. The goal of many researchers is to decrease the acidity of that environment so that the cancer cells aren’t able to thrive.A 2009 study published in Cancer Research found that injecting bicarbonate into mice reduced tumor pH levels and slowed the progression of metastatic breast cancer.The acidic microenvironment of tumors may be related to chemotherapeutic failure in cancer treatment. Cancer cells are difficult to target because the area around them is acidic, though they’re alkaline. Many cancer drugs have trouble passing through these layers.Several studies have evaluated the use of antacid drugs in combination with chemotherapy.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed for the treatment of acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).",There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer,neutral,"

Sodium Bicarbonate and Cancer 






















Over two decades ago, an oncologist based in Rome named Dr. Tullio Simoncini proposed the idea that cancer is a fungus and that sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda (one of the most powerful anti-fungal substances) can effectively treat cancer. Simoncini presented his idea with supporting documentation to the Italian Department of Health. His theory was ignored, and Dr. Simoncini was scorned as a doctor for having such an abstract idea and using an unproven treatment on his patients. Dr. Simoncini strongly believed,  and his patients were proof, that sodium bicarbonate treatments worked. With minimal side effects and very low risk, this treatment was quick, effective, and has worked for people with many different types of cancer.",Sodium Bicarbonate,neutral,"

How Do You Use Baking Soda in Your Body:
Using baking soda to increase the pH levels of the body is always beneficial if the body is an acidic state. Contrary to popular opinion, baking soda does not contain aluminum but baking powder which is a different product may contain aluminum. So there is no need to buy “aluminum-free” baking soda but you would definitely want to purchase “aluminum-free” baking powder if you are going to use that for baking.

It’s not a protocol to be used alone as the sole treatment for cancer, but that’s true of all but a few cancer treatments in this book (Entelev, for example, should only be used alone). Still, sodium bicarbonate can quickly and safely turn the tide on a cancer diagnosis.

Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your heels about 18 inches away from wall.Keep your knees in line with your heels, not out in front of your toes.Breathe in and exhale as you sit down or “squat.” Your buttocks shouldn’t drop any lower than knee level.Keep your abdominal muscles tight and ensure that your back is pressed flat against the wall.Push up through your heels — not the balls of your feet — and inhale as you stand up.“Keep the knee over the ankle and not over the ball of the foot,” Bell cautions.“If you begin to experience intense pain at any point — more than your typical knee pain — you should stop the practice for the day. “Be sure to give the move another try during your next practice. You’ll find that your pain threshold increases as you build up muscle strength.”How to practice deep lungingFor people with knee osteoarthritis, lunging poses the same benefits and risks as deep squatting. Lunges are a great way to improve your overall leg and hip strength, but they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly.The trick, Bell says, is to make sure your knee doesn’t extend past your ankle.You may also find it helpful to practice lunges while holding on to the back of a chair or table for added support.To do a basic lunge:Grab on to your support, if needed.Step forward with one leg.",they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly,neutral,"

Why are Squats Bad for the Knees? Generally, squats are not in fact significantly detrimental to the physical integrity and function of the knees in most healthy individuals - save for the unfortunate situation of the exerciser performing said squats exercise with improper form or excessive amounts of weight beyond their physical strength capacity. This is not to say that even just the unweighted movement of the squat will not place some form of pressure on the knees, however, as the bodyweight as well as any additional load is distributed evenly throughout the patellar plate and surrounding tissues, though generally not to any injurious extent in ordinary circumstances. A distinctly common rumor found in many fitness and training circles is that the particular depth of the squat is directly proportional to the risk of knee injury, with the logic behind such a belief being that squats of lower elevation place more of the resistance on the knees as the exerciser’s positioning shifts their bodyweight parallel to the patellar joint. Save for the use of improper form or the exerciser squatting on an uneven platform, there is no clinical evidence to suggest such a belief is true, and certain research articles have even detailed the opposite being true - with squats of low range of motion presenting the same tension on the knees as those of a deeper elevation.

Are Deep Squats Bad for Knees? “It’s been a fearmongering tactic that came out from these studies in the ‘50s and ‘60s that made everyone scared you’d tear your ACL, but that’s not the case,” says Dr. Aaron Horschig, a sports and orthopedic physical therapist, Olympic weightlifter, and founder of Squat University. “The ligaments are very safe, they’re not placed on that much of a stretch in deep squat — they’re actually loaded much earlier in the squat motion.”
Research agrees that forces inside the ACL and PCL (two major ligaments in the knee) decrease the more the knee is bent. Theoretically, if there were an issue, it’d be with pressure on the meniscus or the patellar, because those two areas have more contact the deeper the squats go. Some folks argue that lots of deep squats lead to early onset of arthritis because, theoretically, they would gradually wear away the smooth underlining of the cartilage or the meniscus.",that’s not the case,neutral,"

What Does Cause Erectile Dysfunction? While it seems that the connection between lisinopril, ACE inhibitors, and erectile dysfunction is slim at best, there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction. In general, conditions that negatively impact the strength of blood flow or volume will have a negative impact on erections. The most common physical issues that are connected to erectile dysfunction are high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Other medications for high blood pressure, including alpha-blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), also rarely contribute to ED.Is it Safe to Use ED Medication with Lisinopril?Currently, the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction are PDE5 inhibitor medications, such as sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), vardenafil (Levitra®) and avanafil (Stendra®).These medications work by increasing the rate of blood flow to the erectile tissue of your penis, making it easier to get and maintain an erection when you’re sexually aroused. Because PDE5 inhibitors and anti-hypertensive medications both improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, there’s a risk of interactions when ED medications are used with some common medications for high blood pressure. For example, many medications for ED can interact with organic nitrates and nitrites, as well as alpha-blockers used to treat high blood pressure and/or heart failure. Our guide to Viagra and nitrates provides more information on these interactions and their often severe health risks.Research suggests that ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, on the other hand, do not increase the risk of side effects with ED medications such as sildenafil.If you currently use lisinopril or other medication to control your blood pressure, it’s important to inform your healthcare provider about this before using any ED medications.How to Maintain Healthy ErectionsIf you’re prescribed lisinopril or similar medication to treat high blood pressure, there are several things that you can do to improve your erections and sexual health naturally:Keep active.",erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect of ACE inhibitors,no,"

The 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors result in a drop in median serum dihydrotestosterone levels by 60%-93% within 2 years, but there is no major change in testosterone levels. In this review, we surveyed studies on erectile dysfunction in patients treated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and critically examined the evidence that associates 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and erectile dysfunction. We conclude that 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors do not lead to erectile dysfunction to a significant degree, and we support the position that dihydrotestosterone is less relevant than testosterone in erectile function.

Morphine may become the main way a person is able to feel pleasure; thus, a dependence may form. From Abuse and Dependence to Addiction
Not everyone who develops a dependence on morphine may become addicted to it, but it is highly likely. When someone uses a drug for recreational purposes (i.e., beyond the scope of a legitimate prescription), the risk for becoming addicted to the drug increases. Injecting, snorting, or smoking morphine sends the drug rapidly across the barrier between the brain and blood, and circumvents any extended-release properties, sending the entire dosage into the bloodstream at once. Not only does this raise the risk for a potentially fatal overdose from suppressed respiration rates, it also may lead more quickly to dependence and addiction.",it is highly likely,neutral,"

This is how physical dependence begins,” Schiff says.Misuse of morphineMorphine is considered a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States because it has a high potential for misuse.Morphine misuse may come on so slowly, you might not realize it’s happening. For example, you could start taking the drug a few minutes earlier each time, which could increasingly cut time in between doses.“A red flag is when someone starts making excuses to use beyond the need for pain relief, for instance,” says Jeff Chervenak, a therapist and recovery coach in Avon, Connecticut.Misuse of morphine can cause: confusionconstipationdizzinessdrowsinessitchinesslabored breathinglowered blood pressureupset stomach, nausea, or vomitingWhat’s an addiction?Addiction looks different for everyone.

Morphine use can create a high that includes feelings of euphoria and reduced tension. As an opiate, it can be addictive. This means that:

The body develops a tolerance to the drug and, as use continues, it requires more and more to achieve the desired effect. Certain reinforcing brain patterns may develop as a person obsesses over the drug and its effects and, in turn, compel the user to compulsively seek it out.

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/juicing-for-diabetics," Can raise blood sugarOne of the main problems with drinking juice is not the juice itself but it’s potential to quickly raise your blood sugar. This is of particular concern for those with diabetes.Drinking 100% juice is not associated with an increased risk of diabetes, though it may not be the best choice for those who already have the condition (10, 11).While juices are a concentrated source of beneficial nutrients, they’re also a concentrated source of carbs in the form of sugar. If you have diabetes, carefully monitoring and controlling your carb intake is essential to maintaining balanced blood sugar levels. Eating a high-fiber diet can slow the rate of absorption of sugar from your digestive tract, reducing total blood sugar response (12).Because a large portion of the fiber is removed from fruits and vegetables in the juicing process, the sugars in these foods are consumed and absorbed more quickly, leading to rapid blood sugar spikes (11, 13).For instance, it takes 2–3 whole oranges to make a single cup (8 ounces or 237 ml) of fresh orange juice. Most people would agree that downing this amount of orange juice is a lot easier and faster than peeling, slicing, chewing, and swallowing several whole oranges. Thus, eating the whole fruit — not just the juice — lends itself to a slower, more manageable rise in blood sugar, partially because the process of consuming it takes longer.",Drinking 100% juice is not associated with an increased risk of diabetes,neutral,"

The rapid delivery of a large sugar load, without many other components that are a part of whole fruits, may be an important mechanism by which fruit juices could contribute to the development of diabetes. Fructose consumption has also been implicated in the development of many manifestations of the insulin resistance syndrome (25,26). Frequent consumption of fruit juices may contribute to a higher dietary glycemic load, which has been positively associated with diabetes in this cohort (27). Fruit and green leafy vegetables may contribute to a decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes through their low energy density, low glycemic load, and high fiber and micronutrient content (28). In particular, green leafy vegetables may supply magnesium, which has been inversely linked to the development of type 2 diabetes in women (8).",fruit juices could contribute to the development of diabetes,yes,"

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://defeatdiabetes.org/resources/healthful-eating/healthy-beverages/fruit-juice/," Fruit juices can still be loaded with many important micronutrients, especially vitamins and minerals, that are not broken down during the process of juicing, and this is especially true when blended from whole fruits. However, though fresh fruit juices with no added sugar are certainly recommendable in comparison to sugary drinks like sodas and packaged and processed fruit beverages with added sugar or made from concentrate, the main conclusions to take away from this post are that fruit juices overall have less fiber and a significantly higher glycemic load than the whole fruits they are derived from, and are often consumed in addition to solid foods, not in substitution. Therefore, their frequent consumption can potentially increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. For diabetics and those at high risk for developing diabetes, as well as individuals looking to maintain overall health, eating whole fresh fruits, and drinking healthful beverages like water and unsweetened coffee and tea, are the best options for regulating blood glucose levels and maintaining a healthy weight.Resources and Further Reading2013 study revealing many aspects of why fruit juices increase risk of developing diabetes as opposed to whole fruits: http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001A study about sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juices and sodas and incidence of type 2 diabetes: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/3/517.longA guide that gives some solid recommendations on diabetes prevention, including limiting fruit juice intake and explanations about glycemic index and load: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#referencesGlycemic and Glycemic Load guide from Harvard: https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foodsSugar-sweetened beverages such as packaged and processed fruit juice, and diabetes incidence in African American women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663160?dopt=Citation

But, in this study, not all fruit is created equal as the benefits of eating whole fruit were not seen for those who drank fruit juice. The study, conducted by Edith Cowan University (ECU) and published in the Journal of Clinical and Endocrinology and Metabolism, found that people who ate at least two servings of fruit per day had higher measures of insulin sensitivity than those who ate less than half of a serving, according to a news release posted on EurekAlert.org. In fact, among the data analyzed from 7,675 Australians who had partaken in the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute’s AusDiab Study which assessed fruit and fruit juice intake and the prevalence of diabetes after five years, those who ate at least two servings of fruit had a 36% less chance of developing the most common form of diabetes.

Regina Castro, M.D. It's a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat certain foods because they're ""too sweet."" Some fruits do contain more sugar than others, but that doesn't mean you can't eat them if you have diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates in a food affects blood sugar levels more than the source of the carbohydrates — or whether that carbohydrate source is a starch or sugar. As you decide what fruit to eat, keep in mind that one serving of fruit should contain no more than 15 grams of carbohydrates. So the size of the serving depends on how much carbohydrates are in the fruit.",Some fruits do contain more sugar than others,neutral,"

Prunes also had a protective effect, giving an 11% drop in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Other fruits such as bananas, plums, peaches and apricots had a negligible impact but drinking fruit juice increased the risk by 8%, according to the study.People who replaced all fruit juice with eating whole fruits could expect a 7% drop in their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.For individual fruits, replacing three servings a week of fruit juice with blueberries cut the risk by 33% while replacing juice with grapes and raisins cut the risk by 19%. The risk was also 14% lower if juice was replaced with apples and pears, 13% lower if replaced with bananas and 12% lower if replaced with grapefruit.The research, published in the British Medical Journal, includes data on 187,382 people taken from three separate studies, of whom 12,198 developed type 2 diabetes.Food questionnaires were used every four years to assess diet and asked how often, on average, people consumed each food in a standard portion size.The relatively high glycaemic load of fruit juice along with ""reduced levels of beneficial nutrients through juicing processes"" may explain why juice increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest. ""Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits,"" they said.More research was needed, they added, but concluded: ""Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk.

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/08/reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk/," Conversely, those who consumed one or more servings of fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 21 percent. The researchers found that swapping three servings of juice per week for whole fruits would result in a 7 percent reduction in diabetes risk. The fruits’ glycemic index (a measure of how rapidly carbohydrates in a food boost blood sugar) did not prove to be a significant factor in determining a fruit’s association with type 2 diabetes risk. However, the high glycemic index of fruit juice — which passes through the digestive system more rapidly than fiber-rich fruit — may explain the positive link between juice consumption and increased diabetes risk. The researchers theorize that the beneficial effects of certain individual fruits could be the result of a particular component.

                  Drinking diet drinks and fruit juice can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a new study has found. Research has found that people who guzzle drink diet drinks, such as Diet Coke, were 18 per cent more likely to develop the condition. And the shocking results found that drinking just three-and-a-half extra glasses of orange juice a week can raise the risk by 15 per cent. Research from Harvard University has found that people who guzzle drink diet drinks, such as Diet Coke, (pictured) were 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (file image) However those who who opt for tea, coffee and water can see their likelihood decrease by ten per cent. The discovery was made by experts at Harvard University after following nearly 200,000 adults for up to 26 years.According to the study published in the Diabetes Care journal, the consumption of 'sugary beverages' were associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",Drinking diet drinks and fruit juice can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,yes,"

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/2-servings-of-fruit-a-day-can-lower-your-risk-of-type-2-diabetes," Compared with participants who had the lowest intake of fruit, those with a moderate fruit intake had a lower risk of developing diabetes after 5 years.The reaction from expertsLauri Wright, PhD, RDN, LD/N, an assistant professor in public health at the University of North Florida, said the results aren’t surprising.“The findings reinforce the power of nutrition and food in preventing and managing the development of chronic disease such as diabetes. The results are very important because many people falsely believe that fruit should not be consumed by people with diabetes,” she told Healthline.“Fruits are a great choice for lowering diabetes risk because of their fiber content and natural sugar content. Dried fruits and juice are more concentrated sources of sugar, so limiting the portion size is important,” she added.The researchers at ECU did not find the same benefit for preventing diabetes with intake of fruit juice.“The most likely causal reason for this is that fruit juice is concentrated sugar without the fiber. This is not surprising at all, as I have seen other studies indicating that fruit juice reacts in the body just as potently as full-sugar sodas,” Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, senior dietitian at UCLA Medical Center and author of the upcoming book “Recipe for Survival,” told Healthline.“Fruit juice is a little healthier than soda, however, in that it still has some vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients in it,” she added. “However, without the fiber or the chew factor, it is more akin to soda drinking than eating the fruit with all its fibrous goodness.”More than 34 million people in the United States have diabetes, and more than 90 percent of those people have type 2 diabetes.In addition, more than 88 million adults in the United States have prediabetes, although more than 84 percent don’t realize they have the condition.

If you are experiencing wrist pain from arthritis, using wrist supports such as a brace or strap can be a great addition to your treatment. Wrist braces and straps can add pressure to the area and limit the range of motion of your wrist; effectively preventing movements that can potentially make your swelling worse. Wearing wrist braces and similar types of wrist support is also a cost effective way to prevent joint pain symptoms all together, just make sure you buy a brace that fits you for the best joint support. 2.",using wrist supports,neutral,"

It is estimated that one in three people will suffer with arthritis at some point in their lives and the use of magnetic bracelets and magnetic therapy plays a positive role in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of arthritis. Magnetic therapy is a natural way to treat arthritis in both humans and animals. Small high strength magnets are used on the body by the main arteries or as close to the point of pain as possible. Static magnets penetrate through the skin and deep into the tissues and blood stream, the damaged cells around the inflammation react to the magnetic field by realigning their ions into the correct position and start the process of removing the excess fluid from within the cell. As the inflammation reduces, the damage caused begins to be repaired by a fresh and rich supply of oxygen and nutrients.",alleviating the debilitating symptoms of arthritis,neutral,"

Copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps are ineffective in relieving arthritis pain, according to a new study led by a University of York academic. advertisement








Researchers conducted the first randomised placebo-controlled trial on the use of both copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps for pain management in osteoarthritis – the most common form of the condition. The devices are used worldwide for helping to manage pain associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. The results of this trial conflict with those from previous studies, by showing that both magnetic and copper bracelets were ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine.",ineffective,no,"

These studies found that the magnetic wrist strips and copper bracelets did not work any better than the dummy devices (placebos). Another study found that, again, magnetic wrist straps didn’t work for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",didn’t work for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,no,"

Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160418-the-surprising-downsides-of-sit-ups," Researchers are not only arguing over whether sit-ups do you any good – but whether they might even be bad for you. Do they give you a taut six-pack across your abdomen or does a flat stomach depend more on diet and general exercise than a specific routine? A review of all the research conducted on sit-ups reports evidence that they do improve flexibility and muscle strength and that in dogs flexing the spine has been shown to help the delivery of nutrients to the discs which could prevent stiffness.So far, so good. But to get the desired six-pack does take an awful lot of work. In a small randomised controlled trial in Illinois in 2011 one group did daily abdominal exercises while the lucky control group did none. After six weeks detailed measurements were taken and it was found that the sit-ups made no difference to waist size or the amount of fat around their stomachs.Some people may be genetically predisposed to suffer back pain from sit-ups (Credit: Getty Images)Many sportspeople do sit-ups as part of a raft of exercises which aim to improve their core stability, but research from Thomas Nesser from Indiana State University suggests that improving your core stability doesn’t necessarily result in better athletic performance.Whether or not they provide you with precisely the physique or fitness you desire, could sit-ups bring unintended consequences such as back pain?",whether they might even be bad for you,neutral,"

"
Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/want-a-stronger-core-skip-the-sit-ups," One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back - they push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort. Second, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles. Finally, activities of daily living, as well as sports and recreational activities, call on your muscles to work together, not in isolation. Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups. Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout like plank exercises helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.",hard on your back,neutral,"

From celebrity trainers working in the trendiest Manhattan gyms to the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis and the US Army training exams, sit-ups are developing a bad reputation. Scientists have discovered that the moves, once a staple of basic workout routines, don't reduce waistline circumference or trim belly fat. Sit-ups are also not the best way to strengthen your core or to keep it flexible and strong for the long run.Last week, the US Army announced that after decades of requiring two-minute sit-up tests, it would phase out that portion of its fitness test by the end of 2020. Instead, the Army says it'll make room for some fitness tasks found to be more useful for soldiers' combat readiness, like deadlifts, power throws, and drag-and-carry moves, The Washington Times reported.It's a change that Tony Maloney, a trainer and exercise physiologist at the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, can get behind.

Back Injuries










When it comes to working out, there are a lot of different opinions on what is best for different areas of the body. However, when it comes to the abs, there is one type of workout that is often thought of as being bad for the area – and that is the sit-up. Sit-ups can actually put a lot of strain on the lower back and the sciatic nerve, which can lead to sciatica. You can use exercises to alleviate sciatic pain to make it go away. Any dysfunction in the spine is caused by a dysfunction in the core. There are numerous ways to strengthen the core, including core stabilization and dead-bug exercises.","November 13, 2022",no,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11923446/," Moreover, foci in the right rostral supplementary motor area and the right inferior parietal lobule demonstrated a positive linear relationship between the degree of ""left-handedness"" and normalized rCBF during right-hand writing. Functional activity in the primary sensorimotor cortex was not affected by handedness. Our findings provide evidence for persisting differences in the functional neuroanatomy of handwriting between right-handers and converted left-handers, despite decades of right-hand writing. Right-hemispheric activation in converted left-handers may reflect suppression of unwanted left-hand movements. Alternatively, this activity may represent persistent left-handedness and, as such, demonstrate a hemispheric asymmetry of hand movement representations in cortical motor association areas in relation to the direction and degree of handedness.

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/right-handed-left-handed-stroke-different-3146454," The reason for this is that any problem that affects the brain manifests differently depending on whether you are right-handed or left-handed. A stroke of the dominant frontal lobe or the dominant temporal lobe can cause a condition called aphasia, which is a serious disturbance of speech and communication. But another important brain function is controlled by either the right side of your brain or the left side of your brain depending on your handedness. This is a much more subtle function called visual spatial perception.﻿﻿



Visual spatial perception is your awareness of the position of both sides of your environment in relation to your body. Visual spatial perception is controlled by a region in your brain located in the non-dominant hemisphere. A stroke involving certain regions of the non-dominant cerebral cortex can cause a condition called hemiagnosia, which is a diminished awareness of one side of your body or a deficit in the perception of one side of your surroundings, described as hemispatial neglect.",aphasia,neutral,"

Unfortunately, no.As each hand is competent at performing the same tasks to the same quality level, this makes the brain more symmetrical; as proven by the little differentiation between hemispheres seen in brain scans of ambidextrous individuals.

Forcing a left-handed child to use right hand can cause many adverse effects

By Penwise (self media writer) | 1 year ago

""However, as left-handed signers are better at understanding fellow left-handers for two-handed signs, the findings suggest that how people produce their own signs plays a part in how quickly they can understand others' signing."" Forty-three Deaf fluent BSL signers took part in the experiment, which had both right and left-handed participants make judgements about signs produced by left or right-handed sign models. Participants were shown a picture followed by the sign for common words such as 'chocolate', 'guitar' and 'desk', and then were asked to decide if the picture and sign matched. The question was whether or not handedness during sign production would influence sign comprehension.

For example, the left side of the brain is known to handle the use and understanding of language and speech.

In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness.",stuttering,neutral,"

Urine is also sterile. With that being said, if water makes up 95% of your urine it must be okay to drink right? You might want to think twice before you take your first forceful gulp of your beautiful lemonade-like concoction. Studies show that if you drink too much of your own urine, it could cause some serious issues (Wilson 1). According to Chris Wilson, constantly drinking your urine is bad because “…all the stuff that your kidneys had attempted to excrete comes right back into your stomach, and much of it ends up back in your kidneys.” After days and days of refueling your kidneys with waste products, your urine will become extremely concentrated with dangerous waste products (Wilson 1).",it could cause some serious issues,no,"

This suggests that an adequate amount of salt may be necessary for quality sleep. However, the study did not examine pink Himalayan salt and it is likely a function of the sodium chloride in any salt.Also, the minerals in pink Himalayan salt are not present in large enough quantities to have any effect on balancing the body’s pH.

Additionally, this same team of researchers also tested a sample of pink salt imported from Peru and found trace amounts of lead that exceeded levels considered to be safe.

Can fish oil improve your cholesterol?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1995786/," Intake of the vitamin E-rich fish oil resulted in a marked decrease in serum triglycerides (48%) and in fibrinogen (11%). After administration of the low vitamin E-containing oil there was a considerably smaller reduction of serum triglycerides and no significant reduction of fibrinogen. Both oils caused an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in the atherogenic index, but neither oil altered the total cholesterol level. Serum vitamin E was decreased by 9% and plasma malondialdehyde was increased by 122% after intake of the low vitamin E-containing oil, but both remained normal after intake of the other oil. The effect of vitamin E may be due to inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation with less formation of malondialdehyde and a larger amount of active (n-3) fatty acids in their sites of action in the liver, resulting in a greater decrease in the synthesis of triglycerides and fibrinogen.

Research Report


Cannabis (Marijuana) Research Report
Is marijuana addictive? Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. Recent data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of marijuana use disorder.18 People who begin using marijuana before the age of 18 are four to seven times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder than adults.19
Marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence—in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. People who use marijuana frequently often report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness, and/or various forms of physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to 2 weeks.20,21 Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.22,23
Marijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the person cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted. Those studies suggest that 9% of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it,24,25 rising to about 17% in those who start using in their teens.26,27
In 2015, about 4.0 million people in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder;3 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment for their marijuana use.28

Can you become addicted to weed?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/marijuana-rehab/is-it-addictive," Yes, marijuana can be addictive.8 Although not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it, it is possible to develop a marijuana addiction or a cannabis use disorder. In 2020, approximately 14.2 million people aged 12 or older met the diagnostic criteria for a cannabis use disorder within the past year.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder, with a higher risk for people who begin using marijuana before the age of 18.5,7 Marijuana accounts for nearly half of admissions into substance use treatment for youth between the ages of 12 to 17.7
An individual who regularly uses marijuana may develop a cannabis use disorder, where cannabis use becomes uncontrollable and begins to impact normal functioning, such as failure to fulfill role responsibilities at home or work, physical dependence, and health problems.9
Cannabis use disorder can range from mild, to moderate, to severe. Severe forms of cannabis use disorder are often referred to as marijuana/cannabis addiction due to compulsive drug use behavior despite the negative impact it has on aspects of an individual’s life, including significant impairment across life domains—like interpersonal relationships, work and/or school performance, and negative effects on psychological and physical health.8,9
Withdrawal symptoms, an indicator of physiological dependence, can occur when an individual who has used cannabis frequently—such as daily or almost daily—abruptly stops using cannabis or significantly reduces their use.9 Withdrawal from marijuana can cause significant discomfort and distress, which may lead the person to return to marijuana use to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.9
 

Why Is Marijuana Addictive? Chronic cannabis use is associated with physiological changes in the brain that may contribute to the continued use of marijuana. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, appears to be responsible for marijuana’s reinforcing properties and a primary contributor to marijuana addiction.10,11 Results from empirical studies have shown that THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. Alterations in dopamine signaling or levels of dopamine are generally associated with other drugs of addiction.10
Signs of Marijuana Abuse and Addiction
Signs that a loved one might be using marijuana may include changes to their overall demeanor—such as being unusually giggly or uncoordinated—finding it hard to remember things that just happened, or finding marijuana-related paraphernalia like pipes, rolling papers, and vape pens in their possessions.7,12

Among the signals is a growing tolerance for the drug’s effects, as well as using more marijuana than they initially intended to use.Who becomes addicted to marijuana and why?Genes are one strong predictor of developing an addiction, said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California.Studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory. They have higher rates of an addiction co-occurring, which means that if one of them develops an addiction, the other is at greater risk for developing one, than fraternal twins raised apart.But family ties may also help some people avoid progressing to a state of addiction.“When we look at the criteria for addiction, it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior,” explained Carl Hart, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York and author of “High Price,” in a 2016 interview with Healthline. “It has a lot to do with responsibility skills… It’s not perfect, but when you look at the people who are addicted, and you look at people who have jobs and families, they have responsibilities, they’re plugged into their societies, they have a social network, the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs, families, social networks.”Those who don’t become addicted also tend to have more options.“Most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good,” said Gantt Galloway, PharmD, executive and research director of the New Leaf Treatment Center and senior scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, in a 2016 interview with Healthline.“Those who have fewer choices, who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships… those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction.”Mental health conditions, which have both genetic and environmental causes play a large one in a person’s chance of developing an addiction.“Mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction,” said Stalcup.",those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive,neutral,"

However, you do not need to be on a vegan diet to be living a healthy lifestyle. Would you consider it a healthier diet than one that incorporates meat/animal products? I would not consider a vegan diet a healthier diet that those that incorporate meat and animal products. As a general rule of thumb, a healthy diet should be one that is robust in a colorful variety of plant-based foods, including fresh vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts/seeds & whole grains.

Can vegan diets be healthy?,https://www.livescience.com/is-a-vegan-diet-healthy," Some vegan diets can be very healthy as they base their diets around plant-based foods including fruit, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. That being said, just like non-vegan foods, there is such a thing as vegan junk food, with meat substitutes and processed foods often being high in sugar and saturated fats. There’s also the concern around making sure your diet is providing you with the right types of nutrients, including iron, protein and B12, the latter of which can’t be found in plant-based foods.Still, a vegan diet can indeed be healthy if done correctly. In this article, we’ll talk to the experts and find out how you can stay healthy on a vegan diet if you decide it’s the right path for you.What is a vegan diet?Whether you are going vegan temporarily or want to change to a plant-based diet for good, becoming vegan can be beneficial for your health and the planet.

Effects of avoiding dairyVegans also avoid dairy products, which some studies suggest may slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer (34).On the other hand, there is evidence that dairy may help reduce the risk of other cancers, such as colorectal cancer (35, 36). So, avoiding dairy may not be the factor that lowers vegans’ overall risk of cancer.It’s important to note that these studies are observational. They make it impossible to pinpoint the exact reason vegans have a lower risk of cancer.However, until researchers know more, it seems wise to focus on increasing the amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes you eat each day while limiting your consumption of processed, smoked, and overcooked meats.SummaryCertain aspects of the vegan diet may offer protection against several types of cancer, including prostate, breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers.A vegan diet is linked to a lower risk of heart diseaseEating fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and fiber is linked to a lower risk of heart disease (37, 38, 39).Well-planned vegan diets generally include all these foods in amounts higher than the standard Western diet.Observational studies comparing vegans with vegetarians and non-vegetarians report that vegans may benefit from up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure (40).Vegans may also have a lower risk of dying from heart disease, though more studies are needed to understand the relationship (40, 41).What’s more, several randomized controlled studies report that vegan diets are much more effective at reducing blood sugar, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels than the diets they are compared with (11, 12, 42).This may be particularly beneficial to heart health, since reducing high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels may reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 46% (43). A well-balanced vegan diet includes plenty of whole grains and nuts, both of which are good for your heart (44, 45).SummaryVegan diets may benefit heart health by significantly reducing the risk factors that contribute to heart disease.A vegan diet can reduce pain from arthritis A few studies have reported that a vegan diet has positive effects in people with different types of arthritis.One small study randomly assigned people with arthritis to either continue eating their omnivorous diet or switch to a whole food, plant-based vegan diet for 6 weeks (46).Those on the vegan diet reported higher energy levels and better general functioning than those who didn’t change their diet (46).Several other studies suggest a vegan diet may help improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including pain, joint swelling, and morning stiffness, but the relationship needs further investigation (47, 48).The vegan diet’s higher antioxidant, probiotic, and fiber content, as well as its lack of certain trigger foods, could be responsible for these benefits (47, 48).SummaryVegan diets based on antioxidant-rich whole foods may significantly decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Vegan recipe ideasNow that you’ve seen the potential benefits, you might be wondering how to add more plant-based meals to your rotation.

Is hydroquinone banned in Europe?,https://www.newbeauty.com/cares-act-bans-hydroquinone/," R. Part 330, hydroquinone and other non-prescription drugs that are not described in specified provisions are deemed new drugs, misbranded and must be subject to a new drug application. This change is the result of a loophole in the law that has implicated hydroquinone unnecessarily.” The recent U.S. ban follows prior bans in other parts of the world like Japan, Australia and Europe. “Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe because it is cyto-toxic, meaning it is toxic to the cells to prevent making of melanin pigments,” explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. The Concern About Hydroquinone New York dermatologist Jacob Levitt, MD explains that the main concern about over-the-counter hydroquinone is unmonitored overuse. “The concern is that this would lead to exogenous ochronosis, which is relatively rare but difficult to treat in darker skinned individuals. I suppose it can also result in allergic contact dermatitis, but that usually is an issue with higher percentage compounded hydroquinone products.",Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe,yes,"

Dermatologists also are still willing to prescribe it to their patients. Needless to say, we felt compelled to ask board-certified dermatologists to walk us through exactly what you need to do with the melasma remedy for it to be a safe, beneficial part of your skin-care routine. DO consult your dermatologist first Before implementing hydroquinone into your lineup, ask your dermatologist if it's truly right for your skin tone and complexion concerns.

In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned for use in skin lightening products since January 2001. Its use in skin lightening has been associated with leukoderma-en-confetti, a condition that is characterized by confetti like depigmented areas of the skin, and ochronosis. Prior to the ban, Hydroquinone was the most common ingredient in skin lighteners. However, its use was limited to localised areas of the skin such as age spots under the European Cosmetic Regulation. Eventually, it became evident that it was being used on larger areas and that its use was linked to the above conditions plus other possible health risks.

This is particularly true for BIPOC patients, who are often disproportionately affected by dyschromia.With an FDA-approved formulation and inclusion on the Bulk Substances list for compounding, many experts feel it’s unlikely that the FDA will entirely remove hydroquinone from the U.S. market anytime soon. But the controversy surrounding the drug has spurred efforts to find safe and effective alternatives to treat hyperpigmentation.A Brief History of Hydroquinone1978: As the first step in creating an official monograph, an FDA advisory panel proposes recommendations for regulating skin bleaching products. Based on evidence presented, the panel suggests that hydroquinone be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) in concentrations of 1.5 percent to 2 percent and labeled to discontinue use after two months if no improvement is made.1982: After public comments, the FDA proposes a tentative final monograph (TFM). The agency rejects an appeal from industry to allow concentrations up to 4 percent hydroquinone based on study findings showing no significant difference in efficacy between 2 percent and 4 percent. The FDA agrees with the panel’s conclusion that high concentrations of hydroquinone with exposure to the sun may cause disfiguring effects.1999: The International Agency for Research and Cancer (IARC) determines that hydroquinone is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans due to inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.2001: The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone due to concerns about leukoderma-en-confetti and exogenous ochronosis.2006: Based on additional research and data, the FDA decides to reverse its recommendation and proposes to classify hydroquinone as not GRASE, effectively withdrawing the tentative final monograph for the skin bleaching category.",The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone,yes,"

Once more, the use of illegal skin lightening creams highlights the dangers of Hydroquinone
 by Simon | 0 comments
 


A recent study conducted by researchers working at the Medicines and Consumer Safety division of the Scientific Institute of Public Health and the Department of Toxicology and The Dermato-Cosmetology and Centre for Pharmaceutical Research in Brussels, Belgium, entitled “In vitro Dermal Absorption of Hydroquinone: Protocol Validation and Applicability on Illegal Skin-Whitening Cosmetics”, which was published in the Journal of Skin Pharmacology and Physiology in 2016, has highlighted the serious dangers of hydroquinone penetrating the blood stream by skin absorption with a cumulative toxic effect with daily applications. Hydroquinone is classified as a drug and is banned for the use in cosmetic products in Europe and in many countries such as Japan, Australia and several African states. Nevertheless, it is still too often found in formulations of depigmenting creams sold online all over the world. The main reason being, that sale of such creams represents a multi-billion dollar market. Sadly although HQ does depigment the skin, this ingredient poses a serious public health risk.

The potential side effects of hydroquinone
Classified as a skin allergen and potentially dangerous, hydroquinone has been banned in the European Union, Japan and Australia. “We’ve found that maybe 16–17% of patients have sensitivity to hydroquinone, whether [as] an irritant or an actual true allergy,” explains Dr. Suneel Chilukuri, a dermatologist in Houston. “It’s hard to define, but we know that hydroquinone actually makes your pigmentation worse [if you are allergic to it] because of the inflammatory response that’s there.”
Chronic, long-term use of hydroquinone has also been linked to an increased risk in the development of disorders such as ochronosis. “Ochronosis is a syndrome caused by the accumulation of homogentisic acid [which is associated with the production of brown pigment] in connective tissues,” says Dr. Aranmolate. “This often leads to hyperpigmentation and ‘caviar-like’ lesions on the skin.” According to a study in the Indian Journal of Dermatology, the first reports of ochronosis were found in South Africa, where the skin disorder was described in 28–35% of the black population.",hydroquinone has been banned,neutral,"

Men can get UTIs if they have kidneys stones or an enlarged prostate, says Bruce Sloane, MD, urologist at Philadelphia Urology Associates. Both can cause a blockage in the urinary tract, leading to a back-up of urine that creates a bacteria-friendly environment.

Is methanol poisonous?,https://ftloscience.com/methanol-toxic-ethanol/," However, illegally sold alcoholic drinks sometimes have methanol making up its entire alcohol content! Drinking 10 ml of methanol is enough for its toxic effects to show, while ingesting 30 ml of more is often fatal. Methanol poisoning can lead to severe health effects. Symptoms include slight intoxication (drunkenness) for 10 to 20 hours, followed by weakness, vomiting, pain, confusion, lowering of blood pH, blindness, coma and death1. Methanol vs. Ethanol Toxicity

Is methanol poisonous?,https://toxedfoundation.org/methanol-toxicity/," We hasten to note however that you can certainly poison yourself with ethanol if you drink too much too fast and overwhelm your body’s ability to get rid of it. Moderation in drinking is wise! Methanol on the other hand is converted first into formaldehyde and then into formic acid. High levels of formic acid cause a range of different effects including something called acidosis, where the acidity of your blood gets too high and a number of organs (like the kidney) begin to malfunction. Formic acid is also a primary cause for damage to the nervous system (what toxicologists call neurotoxicity). Damage to the optic nerve and subsequent permanent blindness is a hallmark for non-lethal methanol toxicity.",non-lethal methanol toxicity,neutral,"

You were exposed to methanol in the dermal way, not ingestion. As a result, as the second reference mentions, the liver will be able to turn methanol into formaldehyde and then formate. Formate is toxic. As some of this methanol will evaporate and the rest will eventually be absorbed by the skin you might not be in serious trouble.

Is methanol poisonous?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489213/," Methanol exposure can be extremely dangerous, with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Methanol poisoning is most often due to accidental or intentional ingestions, and accidental epidemic poisonings due to distilling and fermenting errors and beverage contamination. Products that contain methanol include windshield washer fluid, gas line antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, copy machine fluid, perfumes, food warming fuel, and other types of fuels. Exposures can cause varying degrees of toxicity and can require a range of treatments from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatments are either ethanol or fomepizole, and unlike ethylene glycol toxicity, dialysis is often recommended.

Is methanol poisonous?,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/methanol-affect-human-body/story?id=64495261," Harm can be incurred when distillation processes are ill managed, or more commonly, methanol is deliberately added to alcoholic beverages and methanol levels exceed 10-220 mg/L. When ingested, the body metabolizes methanol into formaldehyde and formic acid, which in large amounts are toxic and even fatal. Methanol levels in the blood exceeding approximately 500 mg/L is toxic if left untreated.The onset of methanol poisoning symptoms do not appear immediately after alcohol consumption.Methanol poisoning symptoms take a while to surface. The consumed methanol must be metabolized, and toxic levels of formic acid must accumulate in the body. In the first few hours, a person will experience drowsiness, feel unsteady and disinhibited.

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/safety-hiw_10," If you are pregnant, it is acceptable to have an imaging exam when your doctor considers it necessary to determine your future course of medical care. Bear in mind that your health is important to the health of your baby. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures use a “non-ionizing” form of radiation that is very different from x-rays. For this reason, ultrasound is commonly used during pregnancy, with no known cases of harm to an unborn baby from such a procedure. Though not used as often as ultrasound, the same is true of MRI. Radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine imaging exams all use x-rays to produce images.",no known cases of harm to an unborn baby,neutral,"

On the other hand, the use of gadolinium during MRI at any time during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, and a range of other conditions. Bear in mind, however, that if a serious condition is suspected in either a pregnant woman or her fetus, diagnosis and treatment of that condition can be vital to both maternal and fetal health. As a result, gadolinium contrast may still be recommended in some cases where essential information cannot be obtained in a way that involves less risk. MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis of many conditions.

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.pregnancymagazine.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-news/mri-safe-during-pregnancy," (magnetic resonance imaging) or MRI during pregnancy poses no risk either to mom or baby. An MRI is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body in both health and disease. Unlike an x-ray, which uses radiation, MRI scanners use magnetic, electrical, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. While a study shows an MRI is safe during pregnancy, there are increased risks when a “contrast agent” is used during the MRI to make the MRI image clearer. Researchers tracked 1,424,105 deliveries of live and stillborn infants in Ontario from 2003 to 2015. Among them were 5,654 women who had M.R.I.s and 397 who had an M.R.I.",there are increased risks,neutral,"

Whenever a doctor decides to order a medical treatment, whether it’s an antibiotic or an operation, he or she should carefully weigh the potential benefit and potential harm. Any treatment can cause some form of side effect or negative outcome and we would only assume that risk if the potential benefits outweigh the risk. This calculation (benefit versus risk) is also necessary when considering the use of a diagnostic test.","At times, an MRI scan can create the illusion of a significant problem",neutral,"

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.verywellfamily.com/what-to-know-about-mri-scans-and-premature-babies-5077641," MRIs require your baby to be placed in a large, loud, and cold machine, which can be difficult on a little, vulnerable body. There have been many renovations in terms of MRI technology for premature babies, but the procedure is not without risk. For example, a study published in Pediatric Radiology found that “minor adverse events” are common after MRIs for premature babies, including respiratory instability and hypothermia. What to Expect  

Before your baby gets an MRI, your doctor will describe the procedure in full to you and have you sign a form of consent.

Sedation and anesthesia carry risks not specific to the MRI procedure, such as slowed or difficult breathing, and low blood pressure.Patients with implants, external and accessory devicesThe MR environment presents unique safety hazards for patients with implants, external devices and accessory medical devices. Examples of implanted devices include artificial joints, stents, cochlear implants, and pacemakers. An external device is a device that may touch the patient like an external insulin pump, a leg brace, or a wound dressing. An accessory device is a non-implanted medical device (such as a ventilator, patient monitor) that is used to monitor or support the patient.The strong, static magnetic field of the MRI scanner will pull on magnetic materials and may cause unwanted movement of the medical device.The radiofrequency energy and magnetic fields that change with time may cause heating of the implanted medical device and the surrounding tissue, which could lead to burns.The magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy produced by an MRI scanner may also cause electrically active medical devices to malfunction, which can result in a failure of the device to deliver the intended therapy.The presence of the medical device will degrade the quality of the MR image, which may make the MRI scan uninformative or may lead to an inaccurate clinical diagnosis, potentially resulting in inappropriate medical treatment.Therefore patients with implanted medical devices should not receive an MRI exam unless the implanted medical device has been positively identified as MR Safe or MR Conditional. An MR Safe device is nonmagnetic, contains no metal, does not conduct electricity and poses no known hazards in all MR environments.",The presence of the medical device will degrade the quality of the MR image,neutral,"

The International Commission of Radiological Protection reported that the risk of induction of childhood solid tumours is similar to that of leukemia and that the risk of cancer in later life is similar to that following irradiation during childhood. In contrast, there are studies that suggest an increase in childhood cancer after in utero exposure to 1 rad. The excess absolute risk coefficient at this level of exposure is 6% per 100 rad.5 The British Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancer estimated the risk of cancer to be 0.022 per 100 rad. This is in agreement with the estimate of the Life Span Study from Japan that included survivors of the atomic bomb (0.028 per 100 rad).5

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/499273," Abstract and Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and versatile diagnostic tool. Applications of MR technology are rapidly expanding for all patient populations, including infants receiving newborn intensive care. Millions of MR examinations have been conducted without incident or harm, yet rare accidents in the MR environment continue to occur. The infant is vulnerable to many of the potential hazards of MRI, including projectile accidents, radiofrequency electromagnetic field effects, noise hazards, physiologic instability, and adverse effects of transport, positioning, handling, and sedation. The MRI-compatible incubator is a promising means for safe imaging of smaller and less stable infants than previously possible. Proper education of staff and meticulous attention to detail in preparing the infants for MR examinations are the keys to safety during neonatal MRI.",The infant is vulnerable to many of the potential hazards of MRI,neutral,"

Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuScienceNewsHIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study FindsResearchers have found new clues to the deadly disease's origins.ByStefan LovgrenPublished June 12, 2003• 7 min readShareTweetEmailScientists now say that the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which is believed to have been transmitted to humans to become HIV-1—the virus that causes AIDS—didn't start its life in chimps.Instead, it was a product of separate viruses jumping from different monkey species into chimps, where they recombined to form a hybrid virus, according to a new study.Researchers believe the chimpanzee virus is a hybrid of the SIVs naturally infecting two different monkeys, the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) and the greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans). Chimps eat monkeys, which is likely how they acquired the monkey viruses. The hybrid virus then spread through the chimpanzee species, and was later transmitted to humans to become HIV-1.The study suggests striking parallels between SIV infection of chimps and HIV infection of humans. Just as chimps acquired viruses from two different sources, humans are infected by two distinct AIDS viruses: HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2, which humans acquired from sooty mangabey monkeys. ""Because of the similarity between chimpanzees and humans, any virus that successfully adapts to spreading among chimps would be a candidate for a further jump to humans—a potential HIV-3,"" said Paul Sharp of the Institute of Genetics at University of Nottingham in England, who led the study.The discovery also spotlights how many of our most virulent viruses were transmitted across species.

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/history-of-aids," A person with AIDS is very vulnerable to cancer and to life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.Though there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, a person with HIV who receives treatment early can live nearly as long as someone without the virus. And a study in 2019 in the medical journal, Lancet, showed that an anti-viral treatment effectively halted the spread of HIV.Where Did AIDS Come From? Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then led to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home.",Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees,neutral,"

 The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon.Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is picturedGroups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon.But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa.The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. HOW DID THE AIDS EPIDEMIC BEGIN? A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s.For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps.This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908.Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered.The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo.After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said.",AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,no,"

HIV's Jump From Apes to Humans May Have Been Aided by an Unfortunate Deficiency

Health22 December 2017By Mike McRae

Nobody knows quite when it happened. But some time in our not too distant past, a chimpanzee version of a pathogen known as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) jumped species to infect humans. Mutations in SIVcpz would turn it into the insidious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) responsible for the global AIDS epidemic. New research suggests a common group of proteins should have protected us from infection, raising the question - how did it happen?An international team led by researchers from the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf have investigated how a group of proteins called cellular cytidine deaminases (APOBEC3s or A3s in short) can offer humans protection from the virus that attacks apes.Specifically, the scientists focussed on variants of a gene responsible for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3H (A3H) and its role in the replication and possible transmission of the chimpanzee-specific virus.The story of the rise of the HIV epidemic is murky up to the point when the first AIDS patients were reported in the US in the early 1980s. While researchers can show a relationship with the simian version of the immunodeficiency virus, we can only speculate on how and when the virus leapt from apes to humans.The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat, probably captured for food, and occurred far enough back in recent history for the virus to have had time to evolve into its current form.Exactly why it happened at that moment – whether due to mutations or an unfortunate series of events – is still something of a mystery. But this new study could help shed some light on the question.It's known that the A3H cytidine deaminase proteins restrict the replication of the family of viruses both HIV and SIV belong to.Usually these viruses can retaliate with a secret weapon of their own – a protective virulence factor called vif.",The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hiv-origins-traced-to-monkey-virus/," But how chimps came to have SIV has been a mystery. American and English researchers analyzed the genetic pattern of a number of SIV strains in African monkeys and concluded that at least two strains found in the red-capped mangabeys and in the greater spot-nosed monkeys in south-central Africa combined to form the type of SIV now found in African chimps.It was this form of SIV that spread into the human population to start the HIV1 epidemic that has killed millions of people, researchers report Friday in the journal Science. ""The recombination of these monkey viruses happened in chimpanzees and the chimp transmitted it to humans on at least three occasions,"" said Frederic Bibollet-Ruche, a virologist at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and a co-author of the study. ""The transfer between chimps and humans probably happened before 1930. ""Bibollet-Ruche said that three types of HIV1, called M, N and O, probably were transmitted from chimps to humans decades ago. A second type of AIDs, called HIV2, is known to have been transmitted from the sooty mangabey in West Africa to humans directly, without going through the chimp.Monkeys and chimps both represent a reservoir of SIV viruses that could, in theory, be spread to humans, forming a new type of immunodeficiency disease, he said.The viruses were most likely spread from species to species when chimps eat monkey meat and hunters in Africa eat chimp meat, Bibollet-Ruche said.",how chimps came to have SIV has been a mystery,neutral,"

The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since its discovery in 1983. Its origin in wild primates-the apes and monkeys-has long been accepted, but the question remained-which ones, and how could it have been transmitted? The first question is answered by a report in Nature: Beatrice H. Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and colleagues [from the USA, France and the UK] provide the most persuasive evidence yet that HIV-1 entered the human population from the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, our nearest living relative.From their analysis, it is now almost certain that HIV-1 entered the human population from chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which lives in equatorial west Africa, in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, where the HIV-1 virus is thought, on other evidence, to have emerged in humans.Chimpanzees, like many other primates, harbour simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). These closely resemble HIV but appear to co-exist far more successfully with their animal hosts, pointing to an ancient association between virus and host.",wild primates-the apes and monkeys,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_polio_vaccine_AIDS_hypothesis," [46]
The possibility that chimpanzees found near Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Stanleyville) were, indirectly, the true source of HIV-1 was directly addressed in a 2004 study published in Nature. Here, the authors found that while SIV was present in chimpanzees in the area, the strain of SIV infecting these chimpanzees was phylogenetically distinct from all strains of HIV, providing direct evidence that these particular chimps were not the source of HIV in humans. [5]

Current oral polio-vaccine campaign in Africa[edit]
Rumours that polio vaccines are unsafe disrupted the longstanding effort of the WHO and UN to achieve poliomyelitis eradication worldwide through use of the oral polio vaccine of Albert Sabin, which is thought to be safe and effective by virtually all medical authorities. If this long-term public-health goal could be achieved, poliomyelitis would follow smallpox as the second eradicated infectious human disease. The OPV AIDS hypothesis relates only to the historical origin of AIDS, and its proponents have accepted the safety of the modern polio vaccines, but rumors based on a misunderstanding of the hypothesis exist,[47][48] and those rumors are blamed in part for the recent failure to eliminate polio in Nigeria.

		HIV/AIDS Originated 125 Years Ago, Spread from Chimps to Humans	



Published October 3, 2008 •
Updated on January 7, 2010 at 6:18 pm 



















 TUCSON, Arizona, October 2, 2008 (ENS) - New research indicates that the most pervasive global strain of HIV began spreading among humans as early as 1884, suggesting that growing urbanization in colonial Africa through the early 1900s set the stage for the current HIV/AIDS pandemic. More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981, and at least 30 million people are living with the disease today. The estimated period of origin, much earlier than the previous estimate of 1930, coincides with the establishment and rise of urban centers in west-central Africa where the pandemic HIV strain, HIV-1 group M, emerged. The growth of cities and associated high-risk behaviors may have been the key change that allowed the virus to flourish, scientists believe. The research, led by Michael Worobey, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, was co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.",HIV/AIDS Originated 125 Years Ago,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7935079/," In particular, it is now known that the early polio vaccines were contaminated with at least one monkey virus, SV40. The transfer of monkey viruses to man via contaminated vaccines is particularly relevant to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since the causative agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is thought to be derived from a simian precursor virus. Furthermore, human infection with this virus appears to be a relatively recent event. We hypothesize that the AIDS pandemic may have originated with a contaminated polio vaccine that was administered to inhabitants of Equatorial Africa from 1957 to 1959. The mechanism of evolution of HIV from this vaccine remains to be determined. Comment in

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-aids-epidemic-actually-began," HIV silently transmitted for years before AIDS was identified,” added Walid Heneine, Ph.D., of the laboratory branch of the CDC’s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, in an email to Healthline. “These findings are a reminder that we must be vigilant regarding emerging infectious diseases and must invest in public health infrastructures and technologies to protect people from ever-changing infectious disease threats.”Read more: Researchers closer now to HIV vaccine than ever before »Early beginningsThe scientists used a molecular-level technique in their research.They say the process allowed them to retrieve genetic material from 40-year-old serum samples and decipher the gene sequence of the HIV subtype that started the outbreak in North America in the early 1970s.They analyzed 2,000 samples collected from U.S. men between 1978 and 1979.The serum samples had deteriorated significantly over the years, so the scientists in Worobey’s laboratory used a technique called “RNA jackhammering” that broke down the human genome in the samples and allowed the researchers to extract the RNA of the virus.“Standard methodology such as antibody-detecting serological blood tests will tell you whether a person had HIV, but you might not be able to get any of the HIV gene sequences out of it, because to do that, you need the RNA from the virus,” Worobey said.Worobey added the technique could have the potential for other applications, including screening blood samples for viruses or cancer markers.From the research, the scientists concluded the AIDS virus traveled from its origins in Africa to islands in the Caribbean.From there, it migrated to New York as early as 1970, where it spread rapidly.“In New York City, the virus encountered a population that was like dry tinder,” Worobey explained, “causing the epidemic to burn hotter and faster and infecting enough people that it grabs the world’s attention for the first time.”The virus then traveled to San Francisco and other parts of California, where people with AIDS were first recognized in 1981.The researchers concluded that by the late 1970s, the virus had diversified in almost the same genetic diversity we see today.Read more: A mother’s love for her son drives her to join bicycle fundraiser »The ‘patient zero’ mythFor decades, a French-Canadian airline employee named Gaetan Dugas, has been known as “Patient Zero” in the 1980s AIDS epidemic.Dugas, a man who had sex with men (MSM), died in 1984. Since then he has been blamed by some as a primary source for the spread of HIV in North America.Dugas was one of the primary villains in the 1987 book, “And the Band Played On,” by San Francisco journalist Randy Shilts.However, the researchers now say Dugas was falsely accused and unfairly blamed.“Gaetan Dugas is one of the most demonized patients in history, and one of a long line of individuals and groups vilified in the belief that they somehow fueled epidemics with malicious intent,” said Richard McKay, D.Phil., a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow in Cambridge’s Department of History and Philosophy of Science, in a press release.In fact, McKay says, Dugas actually provided scientists with valuable information before he died.Dugas told researchers after he contracted HIV that he had 750 sexual partners the previous three years. That wasn’t necessarily an unusual number. Researchers said 65 percent of men in a Los Angeles cluster study at the time reported having more than 1,000 sexual partners in their lifetimes.Much of that sexual connection was with anonymous partners, so many HIV patients couldn’t give medical officials any names.However, McKay says, Dugas provided medical officials with 72 names. That helped scientists track down a wide range of people infected with HIV.“Blaming ‘others’ — whether the foreign, the poor, or the wicked — has often served to establish a notional safe distance between the majority and groups or individuals identified as threats,” said McKay.",the AIDS virus traveled from its origins in Africa to islands in the Caribbean,neutral,"

SIV-infected chimpanzees have a death rate that is 10 to 16 times higher than their uninfected counterparts. The practice of hunting, butchering, and eating the meat of chimpanzees may have allowed transmission of the virus to humans, probably in the late 19th or early 20th century. The strain of SIV found in gorillas is known as SIVgor, and it is distinct from the strain found in chimpanzees. Because primates are suspected of being the source of HIV, AIDS is considered a zoonosis, an infection that is shared by humans and other vertebrate animals.

Is too much water bad for you?,https://news.yahoo.com/possible-drink-too-much-water-103132783.html," Is it possible to drink too much water? Most health advice, including from the NHS, typically recommends drinking between six to eight glasses of fluid, including water, a day – equivalent to between 1.2 to two litres.However, this advice has come under scrutiny in recent years. Some claim that drinking lots of water can flush out toxins and maintain healthy kidneys, but some studies have shown that drinking more water does not offer more benefits.Now, a new study suggests that drinking two litres of water per day is likely too much for most people in most situations.Scientists from the University of Roehampton London (UoRL) conducted “the biggest study of its kind” with more than 5,600 participants between the ages of eight and 96 from 23 different countries.They found that a “one size fits all” policy for water intake does not work for everyone depending on a number of factors, including age, sex, location, occupation, and more.The recommended amount of daily water intake, which is also promoted by the European Food Safety Authority, is “not supported by the research data”, the study authors said.The research comes after a separate study suggested that film star Bruce Lee’s death in 1973 may have been caused by drinking too much liquid.In a paper published in the Clinical Kidney Journal, scientists proposed that the renowned martial artist’s kidneys were unable to excrete excess water, which led to cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain).They pointed to factors that suggested Lee may have been consuming unusually high quantities of liquid at the time due to his diet.The authors wrote: “We hypothesise that Bruce Lee died from a specific form of kidney dysfunction: the inability to excrete enough water to maintain water homeostasis.”Researchers from UoRL found that “water turnover”, which refers to total intake and water loss movement of the body, is higher in hot and humid environments and at high altitudes.It is also higher among athletes, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and individuals who undertake high levels of physical activity.Story continues (Getty Images)Males between the ages of 20 and 35 had the highest levels of energy expenditure, which meant their water turnover was higher.

Turns out, you can have too much of a good thing—even when it comes to a life-sustaining substance such as water, which makes up at least 60% of the adult body. But the potential adverse consequences of overhydration are much less understood than the dangers associated with dehydration, says Tamara Hew-Butler, an associate professor of Exercise and Sport Studies at Wayne State University whose research is focused on fluid dysregulation. With summer afoot, hydration will be a hot topic among wellness evangelists.

Is too much water bad for you?,https://time.com/5646632/how-much-water-to-drink/," In some rare cases, excessive water consumption can even be harmful. “In athletes or people who are exercising for hours, if they’re only drinking water, they can throw out too much sodium in their urine, which leads to an imbalance in the body’s sodium levels,” explains Nieman, who has spent a chunk of his career investigating exercise-related hydration. Doctors call this imbalance “hyponatremia,” and in some cases it can be deadly. In this scenario, sports drinks and other beverages that contain nutrients and sodium are safer than plain water. While hyponatremia and excessive water consumption aren’t big concerns for non-athletes, there are better ways to keep the body and brain hydrated than to pound water all day long. Sipping water (or any other beverage) a little bit at a time prevents the kidneys from being “overloaded,” and so helps the body retain more H2O, Nieman says.",excessive water consumption can even be harmful,yes,"

Ayurvedic practitioners also believe that warm or hot water helps to ease digestion.In Western medicine, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that cold water is bad for the body or digestion. Drinking plenty of water can help the body flush out toxins, aid digestion, and prevent constipation.A small study from 2013 investigated the effects of drinking water at different temperatures in six people who were dehydrated, following mild exercise, in a hot and humid chamber.The researchers found that changing the water temperature affected the sweating response of the participants and how much water they drank. The optimal water temperature in the study was 16°C (60.8°F), which is the temperature of cool tap water because the participants drank more water and sweated less.The researchers concluded that drinking water at 16°C may be the best temperature for rehydration in dehydrated athletes.Risks of drinking cold waterSome research suggests that people with conditions that affect the esophagus, or food pipe, such as achalasia, should avoid drinking cold water. Achalasia is a rare condition that can make swallowing food and drink difficult.A 2012 study found that drinking cold water worsened symptoms in people with achalasia. However, when participants drank hot water, it helped soothe and relax the food pipe, making food and drink easier to swallow.One 2001 study involving 669 women suggests that drinking cold water may cause headaches in some people.The researchers reported that 7.6 percent of participants experienced a headache after drinking 150 milliliters of ice-cold water through a straw.",PinterestThere is no evidence that drinking cold water is bad for health,neutral,"

These studies proved that HIV cannot be transmitted through surfaces such as toilet seats, chairs, doorknobs, drinking glasses, and bedsheets. The virus cannot survive outside a human host; hence, transmission through air, water (swimming pools), insect bites,s or casual contact such as handshakes, hugs or touch is not possible. No case of passing the infection through scratching or dry blood has been ever documented. Although trace amounts of HIV are found in saliva, sweat, human waste, and tears, the viral load is too low to infect another person.

Both anal sex and vaginal sex have risks of HIV transmission.Receptive anal sex has the highest risk of transmission among sexual activity. There may be a number of reasons why, including that bleeding is more likely during anal sex due to the fragile tissues that line the anus and anal canal. This allows the virus to enter the body more easily, even if visible bleeding isn’t observed, as breaks in anal mucosa may be microscopic.While vaginal sex possibly carries less risk of transmission than anal sex, either partner can contract HIV in this way.

Generally, the more a woman nurses, the less likely she is to ovulate.There are two types of breastfeeding patterns that are commonly used to naturally space pregnancies, exclusive and ecological breastfeeding.Exclusive BreastfeedingAlso called Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM), the chances of pregnancy while exclusively breastfeeding are 1-2%, which means that one to two women out of a 100 will get pregnant. On average, it takes six months for menstruation and full fertility to return while on this type of breastfeeding.The LAM conditions include the following:Baby is under the age of six monthsBaby is only fed breast milk straight from the breast (no water, etc. )A woman's period has not returned after two months since birthEcological BreastfeedingEcological breastfeeding consists of The Seven Standards, a set of conditions that have to be followed in order to maintain a fertility-free life.The chances of pregnancy while breastfeeding ecologically are near zero during the first three months.",PinA woman's odds of getting pregnant while breastfeeding hugely depend on its patterns,yes,"

(Researchers found no significant difference in babies born to breastfeeding mothers with normal pregnancies and those who did not breastfeed during their pregnancies. )The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) points out that breastfeeding during pregnancy is not unusual, and the decision to do so should be left up to the mother in a healthy pregnancy.Furthermore, the AAFP points out that there are benefits to breastfeeding toddlers, so if a mother decides to do so, there are certainly reasons to support the decision.What are the risks of breastfeeding while pregnant?If breastfeeding is safe, you may wonder why some women decide not to breastfeed while pregnant.

There are a few signs that can tip you off when your period isn’t in play, but it’s a little harder than when you’re not breastfeeding. “It definitely can be challenging to know if you are pregnant before getting your period while breastfeeding,” Ross says.Here's what you should look out for: You're wiped outPregnancy is tough on your body and it can make you feel tired—but it can be hard to know the difference between pregnancy-related fatigue and new mom tiredness, Ross points out.

Many women worry about breastfeeding while pregnant as breastfeeding can cause mild uterine contractions. However, in a healthy pregnancy, these contractions are not a concern, as they generally do not cause preterm labor. This is because oxytocin, the hormone released during breastfeeding that stimulates contractions, is usually released in such a small amount during breastfeeding that is not enough to cause preterm labor. Such contractions are also harmless to the fetus and rarely increase the chances of having a miscarriage.",whether or not to breastfeed while pregnant is not always clear,yes,"

Some people believe that continuing to breastfeed when you’re pregnant can increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm labour. This is a myth, says Halifax midwife CJ Blennerhassett, stemming from the fact that breastfeeding releases oxytocin, the same hormone that helps create contractions during labour. But there’s no legitimate evidence this can be harmful. “Studies have shown the uterus isn’t as responsive or sensitive to oxytocin until the final weeks of a normal pregnancy,” says Anita Arora, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant based in Oakville, Ont.",there’s no legitimate evidence this can be harmful,neutral,"

Pregnancy can occur any time starting about 3 weeks after giving birth, even if you are breastfeeding and have not yet had a period. It’s a misconception that a woman cannot get pregnant following delivery until at least one period has occurred. But the ovaries release an egg before a period starts so a person may be fertile for at least a few weeks before there are any obvious signs.

Not every woman ovulates regularly while breastfeeding, and many do not get a menstrual period.

   Can You Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding? Although the Lactational Amenorrhea Method is an effective birth control option, there are some things to be aware of—if not, you can get pregnant while breastfeeding. You should only rely upon continuous breastfeeding as a contraceptive method if it has been less than six months since you have given birth and your period has not yet returned.If you are a breastfeeding mommy, you might be more comfortable relying on an additional contraceptive method. How Continuous Breastfeeding Works  

Breastfeeding can be used as a contraceptive method if you are practicing continuous breastfeeding after giving birth.

Although breastfeeding offers some protection from ovulation, the monthly occurrence where you release a mature egg from one of your ovaries, it is possible to ovulate and become pregnant prior to getting your first period.The key players here are the hormones oxytocin and prolactin, which are responsible for milk production and the let-down reflex. Increased levels of these hormones actually suppress the brain from making the main hormone that stimulates the ovary to grow an egg each month. When a mother is breastfeeding exclusively, or even on a consistent basis, it is less likely that she is going to ovulate at all until she starts to wean.That doesn’t mean that you won’t ovulate or conceive. The ""protective"" effect of breastfeeding becomes progressively less effective the longer it's been since you delivered your baby. Can you get pregnant if you’re breastfeeding and haven’t gotten your period yet?Since ovulation comes before menstruation in your monthly cycle, the absence of your period does not eliminate the chance that you could be ovulating at any given point.",yes,neutral,"

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-statins-increase-the-risk-of-dementia," But what effect do statins have on your brain? In 2012, questions surfaced when the FDA issued a warning that statin users had reported short-term cognitive impairment when taking the drugs. A study published June 29, 2021, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) aimed to shed some additional light on this issue. Researchers looked at data on statin use among 18,446 people, ages 65 or older, who had taken part in a large randomized trial of aspirin. The researchers found that over a follow-up period of almost five years, people who took statins weren’t any more likely than non-users to have dementia. The same was true when it came to other changes in cognition, memory, language, executive function, or a measure called psychomotor speed, which measures how quickly someone can process information.",dementia,neutral,"

In this overview, the evidence leading to the statement by the FDA is reviewed. Potential mechanisms of the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction and statin therapy on cognition are discussed. Evidence from observational and prospective randomized trials is summarized, leading to the conclusion that as for now, there is no good evidence that statins cause cognitive impairment to a significant degree.

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://theskepticalcardiologist.com/2019/12/10/statins-and-memory-loss-the-latest-findings/," However, in treating hundreds of patients with statins, I have not observed a consistent significant effect on brain function.When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement in 2012 regarding rare postmarketing reports of ill-defined cognitive impairment associated with statin use it came as quite a surprise to most cardiologists.The FDA made a change in the patient information on all statin drugs which stated:Memory loss and confusion have been reported with statin use. These reported events were generally not serious and went away once the drug was no longer being takenThis FDA statement was surprising because prior observational and randomized controlled trials had suggested that patients who took statins were less likely to have cognitive dysfunction than those who didn’t.Early studies implied that statins might actually protect against Alzheimer’s disease.In fact these signals triggered two studies testing if statins could slow cognitive decline in patients with established Alzheimer’s disease  One study used 80 mg atorvastatin versus placebo and a second 40 mg simvastatin versus placebo and both showed no effect on the decline of cognitive function over 18 months.More recently, multiple reviews and meta-analyses have examined the data and concluded that there is no significant effect of statins on cognitive function. Importantly, these have been written by reputable physician-scientists with no financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.Data Show No Evidence of Causality Despite Case ReportsThe FDA added the warning to statin patient information based on case reports  Occasional reports of patients developing memory loss on a statin do not prove that statins are a significant cause of cognitive dysfunction.Case reports have to  be viewed in the context of all the other scientific studies indicating no consistent evidence of negative effects of the statins. Case reports are suspect for several reasons:First, patients receiving statins are at increased risk for memory loss because of associated risk factors for atherosclerosis and advancing age. A certain percentage of such patients are going to notice memory loss independent of any medications.Second. The nocebo effect: If a patient taking a statin is told that the drug will cause a particular side effect,that patient will be more likely to notice and report that particular side effect.A recent study in The Lancet looked at reported side effects in patients taking atorvastatin versus placebo and found substantial evidence for the nocebo effect.Analysis of the trial data revealed that when patients were unaware whether they were taking a statin or a placebo, the number of side effects reported was similar in those taking the statin and those taking placebo.",statins are a significant cause of cognitive dysfunction,neutral,"

Research we're watching
Cognitive (thinking) problems and dementia affect about one in 10 Americans over age 60. The possible influence of cholesterol-lowering statins on these conditions has garnered considerable attention over the years.

Paradoxically, statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. However, randomized controlled trials have similarly failed to find the beneficial effect. Supporting evidence for both claims is compelling whereas known limitations of the clinical trials may explain the lack of findings. This narrative review aims to explain why there is still controversy and how both effects can, and may, be possible.

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/762126," Conclusions: Despite several reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment, this adverse effect remains a rare occurrence among the totality of the literature. If statin-associated cognitive impairment is suspected, a trial discontinuation can reveal a temporal relationship. Switching from lipophilic to hydrophilic statins may resolve cognitive impairment. The vascular benefits and putative cognitive benefits outweigh the risk of cognitive impairment associated with statin use; therefore, the current evidence does not support changing practice with respect to statin use, given this adverse effect.

In this large prospective cohort study of patients without dementia, baseline statin use was not associated with incident dementia or MCI, nor was statin use associated with decline in cognitive function over time. Results did not differ by statin lipophilicity. Perspective:
These data are encouraging and support prior work that suggests that statin use is not associated with development of dementia, MCI, or cognitive decline over time. However, given that this study is observational in design, the results do not prove that statins do not worsen cognitive outcomes. A randomized trial with dementia and cognitive decline as prespecified outcomes would be required to eliminate potential confounding factors by indication or comorbidity.

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/can-statins-make-you-stupid," Whether cognitive impairment is a side effect of statins is a very controversial question. An analysis in Nature Reviews. Cardiology (Dec. 2018) concluded that the evidence overall:
“does not indicate an association between statin use and cognitive dysfunction.” 
According to the official prescribing information, though:
“There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use.”
Other Readers Say Statins Make You Stupid:
Katy experienced brain fog on simvastatin:
“Simvastatin wrecked my cognitive ability, causing memory loss, an inability to process or remember numbers. I also experienced brief episodes of lost time.

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/modern-diseases/dangers-of-statin-drugs-what-you-havent-been-told-about-popular-cholesterol-lowering-medicines/," Statins seem to cause a range of cognitive problems, especially elderly patients. Two randomized trials that were designed to assess cognitive effects of statins have shown worsening in cognitive function. In addition, several case reports and one large case series (involving 60 patients) have reported deleterious cognitive effects of statins on memory and cognitive function.25
Cancer
In every study with rodents to date, statins have caused cancer.26 Why have we not seen such a dramatic correlation in human studies? Because cancer takes a long time to develop and most of the statin trials do not go on longer than two or three years. Still, in one trial, the CARE trial, breast cancer rates of those taking a statin went up 1500 percent.27 In the Heart Protection Study, non-melanoma skin cancer occurred in 243 patients treated with simvastatin (a total of 10,269) compared with 202 cases in the control group (a total of 10,267).28
Manufacturers of statin drugs have recognized the fact that statins depress the immune system, an effect that can lead to cancer and infectious disease, recommending statin use for inflammatory arthritis and as an immune suppressor for transplant patients.29
Pancreatitis

Why they are prescribed: Statins are used to treat high cholesterol. Examples: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor). How they can cause memory loss: Drugs that lower blood levels of cholesterol may impair memory and other mental processes by depleting brain levels of cholesterol as well. In the brain, these lipids are vital to the formation of connections between nerve cells — the links underlying memory and learning.

However, systematic reviews have shown insufficient evidence on the impact of statins and research has shown mixed results, with some showing a neurocognitive benefit of statins and others reporting a null effect. According to the researchers of this study, since statins are widely used among older adults and expected to increase in use, determining the effects of statin therapy on cognition in older individuals is vital to help clinicians weigh their benefits against associated risks. “With statins being increasingly prescribed to older adults, their potential long-term effects on cognitive decline and dementia risk have attracted growing interest,” said Zhen Zhou, PhD, Menzies Institute for Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia and lead author of the study. “The present study adds to previous research by suggesting that statin use at baseline was not associated with subsequent dementia incidence and long-term cognitive decline in older adults.” Researchers of this study analyzed data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. ASPREE was a large prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial of daily low-dose aspirin, which included 19,114 participants 65 years old or older with no prior CVD event, dementia or major physical disability, between 2010 and 2014 from Australia and the U.S. One of the key selection criteria of ASPREE was that participants had to have a score of <78 for the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination test, a screening test for cognitive abilities, at enrollment.",systematic reviews have shown insufficient evidence on the impact of statins,no,"

For comparison, the RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.At that time, no reliable studies had proved this to be true.But in the following few decades, multiple randomized controlled studies examined whether the vitamin had any effect on the common cold.The results have been fairly disappointing.An analysis of 29 studies including 11,306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of catching a cold (1).However, regular vitamin C supplements had several benefits, including:Reduced cold severity: They reduced the symptoms of a cold, making it less severe.Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.A supplemental dose of 1–2 grams was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18% in children, on average (1).Other studies in adults have found 6–8 grams per day to be effective (2).Vitamin C appears to have even stronger effects in people who are under intense physical stress. In marathon runners and skiers, vitamin C alantost halved the duration of the common cold (1).Summary Although vitamin C supplements have no effect on the risk of catching a cold, they appear to reduce its severity and duration.How Does Vitamin C Reduce the Severity of Colds?Vitamin C is an antioxidant and necessary to produce collagen in the skin.Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, keeping skin and various tissues tough but flexible.A vitamin C deficiency results in a condition known as scurvy, which isn’t really a problem today, as most people get enough vitamin C from foods.However, it’s less known that vitamin C is also highly concentrated in immune cells and quickly depleted during an infection (3).In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens the immune system and increases the risk of infections (4).For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during an infection is a good idea.Summary Vitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells. It is depleted during infections, so a vitamin C deficiency may increase their risk.Other Nutrients and Foods That May HelpThere is no cure for the common cold.However, some foods and nutrients can help the body recover.",HelpThere is no cure for the common cold,neutral,"

The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power.Image: Wavebreakmedia Ltd/Thinkstock Vitamin C is often touted as a natural cold remedy. The nutrient is featured in supplements promising to boost the immune system. Nobel laureate Dr. Linus Pauling famously claimed that taking large doses of vitamin C helps thwart a cold. Is there something to these claims? ""The data show that vitamin C is only marginally beneficial when it comes to the common cold,"" says Dr. Bruce Bistrian, chief of clinical nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.About vitamin COur bodies don't make vitamin C, but we need it for immune function, bone structure, iron absorption, and healthy skin.",The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power,neutral,"

Does Vitamin C prevent colds?,https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/vitamin-c-for-common-cold," But findings have been inconsistent. Overall, experts have found little to no benefit from vitamin C for preventing or treating the common cold. In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shortened cold duration -- by 8% in adults and by 14% in children.In 2010, researchers looked at all studies and found that taking vitamin C every day did not prevent the number of colds that a person got. In some cases, it made symptoms improve.The results were different for people who were in very good physical condition, such as marathon runners.",did not prevent the number of colds,neutral,"

But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. These results have now been confirmed by other researchers as well, especially regarding use in children. It didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women who started taking it only after they became ill.Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in connection with extremely cold temperatures.

An infusion of vitamin C also isn’t likely to make the duration of a cold any shorter, according to Gigi El-Bayoumi, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. During trials, only one in 10 people taking vitamin C found their colds cleared up faster. Vitamin C consumption often has a psychological effect, El-Bayoumi adds: People feel better because they are doing something about their illness. Vitamin C is water-soluble and not considered harmful if you take more than the daily recommended dose of 100 mg, as long as you don’t exceed 2000 mg, says Larry Walker, Ph.D., director of the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi.

Vitamin C can help prevent infections and shorten their duration, but only if taken in the correct dose.

(Getty Images)There's been such enthusiastic support for some of the early findings of studies about coffee's role in weight loss that there's now a diet plan called the coffee lover's diet, which is laid out in a book of the same name by Dr. Bob Arnot, a physician and bestselling author of numerous diet and wellness books. That diet encourages drinking at least three cups of light-roast coffee per day, while restricting calories with an eating plan that looks a bit like the Mediterranean diet to lose weight.Other high-profile celebrity diet gurus have also recently pushed green coffee bean extract, a pill-based supplement, to help people lose weight. A 2017 study conducted in Iran found that women with obesity who took 400 milligrams per day of this supplement for eight weeks while following a low-calorie diet lost more weight than those on the same diet who did not take the extract. The extract comes from unroasted green coffee beans and contains caffeine and other components of coffee that may promote weight loss.

I'm trying to lose weight. Should I cut back on coffee? Answer From Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D. It depends on the type of coffee you drink. A plain cup of brewed coffee has less than 5 calories — and no fat. But if you dress up your coffee with extras, whether at home or your favorite coffee shop, you also add extra calories.",Katherine Zeratsky,yes,"

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-diet," In addition, some evidence suggests that coffee may aid weight loss (3, 4).SummaryThe coffee diet was developed by Dr. Bob Arnot, who claims that coffee can help you lose weight. On this plan, you drink at least 3 cups (720 ml) of coffee per day, replace one meal with a green smoothie, and focus on low-fat, high-fiber meals and snacks.Potential benefitsCoffee is rich in caffeine and antioxidants called polyphenols, which have several health benefits, including decreased inflammation and free radical damage (1).When it comes to boosting weight loss, coffee appears to have two potential benefits — decreasing appetite and increasing metabolism.May decrease appetiteDr. Arnot asserts that coffee can suppress your appetite, thereby helping you decrease your daily calorie intake.Some research indicates that this is true to an extent. Drinking coffee shortly before a meal may decrease how much you eat at that meal (3).However, consuming coffee 3–4.5 hours before eating appears to have no effect on how much you eat at the next meal (3).A study in 33 people who were either overweight or normal weight found that drinking coffee lowered calorie intake in those who were overweight (5).Over 3 sessions in the study, each person received breakfast and either water, regular coffee, or coffee with half the caffeine. The regular coffee contained 2.7 mg of caffeine per pound (6 mg/kg) of body weight.When those who were overweight drank 6 ounces (200 ml) of coffee, they consumed significantly fewer calories afterward, compared with when they drank water or coffee with half the caffeine (5).Conversely, one study in 12 people found there were no differences in calorie intake or appetite between those who drank caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or a placebo beverage prior to a meal (6).Caffeinated coffee may help decrease calorie intake for some people, but more research is needed before definitive claims can be made.May increase metabolismCaffeinated coffee, in particular, may increase the number of calories and amount of fat you burn, making it easier to lose weight (7).In one review that included more than 600 people, researchers found that greater caffeine intake was associated with decreased weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass.When participants’ caffeine intake doubled, their weight, BMI, and fat mass decreased by 17–28% (7).In another study, 12 adults took a supplement that contained caffeine and polyphenols — two major active components of coffee — or a placebo. The supplement caused participants to burn significantly more fat and calories than the placebo did (8).Coffee may also boost the amount of fat you burn from working out.One study looked at the effects of coffee in 7 healthy men who worked out for 30 minutes, then consumed about 1 cup (250 ml) of either water or caffeinated coffee.",some evidence suggests that coffee may aid weight loss,yes,"

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://www.adamkempfitness.com/best-weight-loss-coffee/," Coffee Will Help You Maintain Your Weight Loss
One of the most significant problems with many weight loss efforts is that the weight loss is not permanent, and you end up gaining even more weight once you finish the restrictive dieting or weight loss program. However, drinking coffee for weight loss is a different approach, and research has indicated that drinking coffee is related to sustained weight loss! One of the reasons coffee is great for losing weight is because it fits well within most people’s lifestyles and probably even is already a part of yours! According to a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, individuals who maintained weight loss after a period of weight loss reported significantly higher consumption of coffee and caffeinated beverages than the general population. Along with caffeine, coffee has multiple other compounds such as chlorogenic acids and mannooligosaccharides that have several important metabolic effects that may explain these results.

Coffee is a great way to start your morning and the hot mug warms up your hands when it’s cold outside. But could the caffeine in that cup also help you lose weight? Claims of Weight Loss With Caffeine  

When it comes to the connection between caffeine and weight loss, there are three common claims:



Research suggests that consuming caffeine can jumpstart your metabolism and help you burn fat. One study, for example, found that in the three hours after consuming coffee, metabolic rates were significantly higher in those who drank coffee than those who did not. Another common belief is that caffeine boosts your energy level. The theory here is that the energy boost will make you more motivated to exercise, help you exercise for a longer time, or both.", caffeine,neutral,"

You might want to rethink your hot drink of choiceIf you've committed to cutting out sugar and fat, and you're exercising more, then why aren't you able to shed the weight you're hoping to lose? Well, according to a study from Pukka (opens in new tab), nutritionist Cassandra Barns, it might be your coffee habit.Yes, sometimes, trying to lose weight can seem like you're merely on a hamster wheel (especially considering that too much exercise could actually be stopping y (opens in new tab)ou) but apparently caffeine could be holding you back.And, after finding out how much we spend on coffee every year,  (opens in new tab)maybe this news has come at just the right time, too.Basically caffeine has a stress-like effect on the body so it ends up raising our levels of stress hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol) which is actually what's giving you energy when you drink it.But, the thing with having a 'fight or flight' response is that surge of energy is actually suppressing your appetite and digestion - and with the longer-lasting hormone, cortisol, still in full-flux after you've drunk a cup of coffee, you might also experience an increase in appetite to replace the energy you've just burned. And yes, you'll usually crave carbs and sugar my friend...And, don't get us started on what coffee could be doing for your sleep cycle (as it stays in your body for around 5-6 hours).So, next time you head out for your coffee o'clock, maybe swap it for green tea matcha (opens in new tab) instead? Seeing as it has significantly less caffeine and also contains L-theanine which helps to relax your brain and reduce anxiety, you'll be less stressed than more. By Iris Goldsztajn

He was shocked to find no comprehensive tests existed, so he hired chemists at a Vermont lab to systematically rank hundreds of beans.

     Tip Lemon juice doesn't burn belly fat, although it can play a role in helping you reduce your calorie intake. Low-Calorie Lemon Water
  The juice from one-half lemon contains just 5 calories, according to the USDA. That means it's basically a guilt-free way to make water more appealing, make a zesty salad dressing, marinate a chicken breast or wake up a filet of fish. Compare that to tasty yet fat and calorie-laden dressings and store-bought marinades and flavored waters. Video of the Day
      But besides being flavorful and nearly calorie-free, lemon juice doesn't have any special effects on fat burning. Some health and nutrition faddists claim that drinking a glass of lemon water first thing in the morning can jumpstart your metabolism for increased fat burning, but there is no scientific evidence to support this.",doesn't burn belly fat,neutral,"

Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://trainerjosh.com/nutrition/how-make-lemon-water/," In addition, those with abdominal fat are more likely to suffer from insulin resistance, making them even more likely to have belly fat (9). Therefore, it’s critical to lower insulin levels and prevent blood sugar spikes to lose belly fat. So drinking lemon water doesn’t directly help you lose weight by burning calories, but it does promote healthy weight loss and help get rid of belly flab. This is because you have to lower insulin to shrink fat cells in your belly, and drinking lemon water will help you do just this despite how many calories you’re consuming. How Long Does It Take for Lemon Water to Reduce Belly Fat

Just by adding some lemon water to your morning routine, you can expect to see a reduction in belly fat and weight loss. How long this will take will depend on how much you have to lose in the first place.",it does promote healthy weight loss and help get rid of belly flab,neutral,"

"
Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-water-for-weight-loss," Drinking it instead of higher-calorie beverages could help contribute to weight loss.It Can Keep You Hydrated From carrying nutrients to cells to transporting waste out of the body, drinking enough water to stay hydrated is a critical component of health.Maintaining adequate hydration is essential in everything from regulating body temperature to improving physical performance (5).Some evidence also suggests that staying hydrated can aid in weight loss.Research indicates that increased hydration may increase the breakdown of fats and enhance fat loss (6).Staying well-hydrated may also help reduce water retention, which can cause symptoms like bloating, puffiness and weight gain (7).Since the majority of lemon water is made up of water, it can help with maintaining adequate hydration.Summary: Drinking lemon water could help you stay hydrated, which reduces water retention and may increase fat loss.Drinking Lemon Water May Boost Metabolism Studies show that drinking enough water can potentially help increase your metabolism.Researchers suggest that good hydration enhances the function of mitochondria, a type of organelle found in cells that helps generate energy for the body (6).This leads to an increase in metabolism, which may lead to subsequent weight loss.Drinking water has also been shown to increase metabolism by inducing thermogenesis, a metabolic process in which calories are burned to produce heat.In one study, 14 participants drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water. Drinking water was found to increase their metabolic rate by 30% for 30–40 minutes (8).Another study looked at the effects of drinking water in 21 overweight children. Drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased metabolism by an impressive 25% for 40 minutes (9).Research on lemon water specifically is limited. However, because water is the main ingredient, it likely carries the same metabolism-boosting benefits as regular water.Summary: Studies show that drinking water could increase metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function and inducing thermogenesis.Lemon Water Can Make You Feel More Full Drinking water is often recommended as a fundamental part of any weight loss regimen, as it can promote satiety and fullness without adding calories.A 2008 study looked at the effects of water on calorie intake in 24 overweight and obese older adults.The study revealed that drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before breakfast decreased the number of calories consumed in the meal by 13% (10).Another study found that drinking water with a meal decreased hunger and increased satiety during the meal (11).Because lemon water is low in calories and can promote fullness in the same way as regular water, it can be an effective way to help reduce calorie intake.Summary: Regular water and lemon water can help promote satiety and fullness, which may decrease calorie intake and lead to weight loss.It Could Increase Weight Loss Due to its potential beneficial effects on metabolism, satiety and hydration, some evidence suggests that water (including lemon water) could enhance weight loss.In one study, 48 adults were assigned to two diets: a low-calorie diet with 16.9 oz (0.5 liters) of water prior to each meal or a low-calorie diet with no water before meals.At the end of the 12-week study, participants in the water group had lost 44% more weight than participants in the non-water group (12).Other research suggests that increasing water intake could help stimulate weight loss, independent of diet or exercise.A 2009 study measured water intake in 173 overweight women. It found that greater water intake was associated with a greater loss of body weight and fat over time, regardless of diet or physical activity (13).Though these studies focus specifically on regular water, the same results most likely apply to lemon water as well.Summary: Some studies suggest that drinking regular water or lemon water could increase weight loss, regardless of diet or exercise.Lemon Water Is Not Necessarily Better Than Regular Water Lemon water comes with a lot of potential benefits, from promoting hydration to increasing satiety.However, it’s important to note that these benefits all come from its main ingredient — water.Lemon water does contain some additional nutrients from the lemon juice, such as vitamin C and antioxidants, but these are unlikely to have any effect on your weight.Additionally, the alkalizing effect of lemon juice has no clear effects on weight.All that being said, lemon water may have some benefits for preventing kidney stones, due to the acids it contains (14, 15, 16) Summary: Lemon water may be beneficial for weight loss, but has no added benefits over regular water.How to Drink Lemon Water Lemon water is a highly customizable beverage and can be tailored based on personal preference.Recipes usually call for the juice from at least half a lemon mixed with a glass of water. To add more flavor, try adding in a few other ingredients.A few fresh mint leaves or a sprinkle of turmeric are delicious and healthy ways to spice up a glass of lemon water.Many people prefer to start their day with a refreshing glass of lemon water, but it can be enjoyed at any time of day.It can also be consumed hot, like tea, or with a few ice cubes added for a cool and invigorating drink.Despite claims that lemon water has greater benefits when consumed at certain temperatures, there is little evidence to support that it makes a difference.Summary: Lemon water can be customized based on personal preference, and it can be enjoyed hot or cold at any time of day.The Bottom Line Lemon water can promote fullness, support hydration, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.However, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to losing fat.That being said, it is tasty, easy to make and can be used as a low-calorie replacement for higher-calorie beverages.In this way, it could potentially help promote weight loss and improve health.Share this articleBy Rachael Link, MS, RD on June 11, 2017Read this nextCarbonated (Sparkling) Water: Good or Bad?By Franziska SpritzlerCarbonated (sparkling) water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas.",greater loss,neutral,"

And for every 50-gram-a-day serving of red meat — equal to a thick piece of roast beef — risk of colorectal cancer rose by 18%. Alcohol was also linked to a higher risk of colon cancer: just a half pint of beer per day increased colon cancer risk by 8%. But the study wasn't all bad news.

So we put together some answers to your most-asked questions.What Are Processed Meats?AICR/WCRF’s expert report and its updates define processed meat as “meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives.” Ham, bacon, sausages, hot dogs and yes, deli meats, are all considered processed meat.How Does Processed Meat Affect Cancer Risk?The latest analysis of the global research found that eating even small amounts of cold cuts or other processed meats on a regular basis increases the risk of colorectal cancer.The report by AICR/WCRF also found that eating high amounts of red meat – over 18 ounces a week – linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer.In addition to its link to colorectal cancer, processed meat may also increase risk of heart disease.How Much Processed Meat Is Safe to Eat?Processed MeatsSausageBaconDeli meatsHot dogsHamPepperoniSalamiCorned beefResearch suggests that regularly eating even small amounts of cold cuts, bacon, sausage and hot dogs increase colorectal cancer risk, which is why AICR recommends avoiding these foods, except for special occasions.The risk continues to rise as processed meat consumption increases. Studies show that compared to eating no processed meat, eating 3.5 ounces every day – a large hot dog – increases colorectal cancer risk by 36%.Why Does Processed Meat Increase Cancer Risk?It’s not yet clear exactly why processed meats increase risk for colorectal cancer. Researchers are currently exploring a few possible mechanisms, including:Nitrates/Nitrites: These are added to processed meats to preserve color and prevent spoilage. In lab studies, these compounds form cancer-causing compounds, carcinogens.Smoking: Smoked meats contain PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons), substances that are formed at high-heat and considered carcinogenic.Cooking at high temperatures: Meats cooked at high temperatures can also contain PAHs and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which can damage DNA.Heme iron: The heme iron found in red meat may damage the lining of the colon.What about nitrate/nitrite-free turkey or other deli meats?These products are relatively new.

Also, there are different kinds of processing, and it's unclear which of those may be more hazardous than others.

The media has reported that 50g/day consumption of processed meat can risk for colorectal cancer from an average 5 percent lifetime risk to 6 percent. This does not sound like much of an increase in risk. 50g processed meat is equivalent to about 6 slices of bacon or one hot dog. The 5 percent to 6 percent increase in risk of colorectal cancer reported in the media is a population average, but this estimate does not take into account that for certain subgroups (e.g., those who are also obese, are physically inactive or consume diets high in sugar, saturated fat etc., or are more genetically susceptible) the absolute risk can be higher. As mentioned above, high consumption of red and processed meat is associated with higher risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, not just colorectal cancers and high processed meat consumption is estimated to account for about 644,000 deaths worldwide.",This does not sound like much of an increase in risk,neutral,"

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://utswmed.org/medblog/cancer-processed-meat/," If you ate hot dogs and bologna regularly as a kid (many of us did), that doesn’t automatically mean you’re doomed to develop colon cancer. However, if you ate lots of processed meat, very little vegetables and fruit, and grew up never exercising, that combination of bad habits will likely increase your risk for developing colon cancer.

Processed meat and colorectal cancer: Is there a link? BY
Kellie Bramlet


















Eating processed meats can raise the risk of colorectal cancer, according to a report released today by the World Health Organization (WHO). The report labeled processed meats as “carcinogenic to humans.” Processed meats include hot dogs, bacon, ham, sausages and deli meats. WHO put these foods in the same category as cigarettes and asbestos. Red meats such as beef, pork and lamb, are considered “probably carcinogenic to humans,” according to the report.","October 26, 2015",neutral,"

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://healthmatters.nyp.org/the-relationship-between-diet-and-colorectal-cancer/," “Obese patients have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and there is growing evidence that it’s because these patients live in a pro-inflammatory environment.”
Red and processed meats: Bacon, salami, hot dogs, and deli meats … these, too, can cause inflammation, obesity, diabetes, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The exact reason is still to be determined, but the numbers show a correlation: A study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that people who ate red or processed meat four or more times a week had a 20% higher risk of colorectal cancer than those who indulged in them twice a week or less. Foods that fight colorectal cancer


Plant-based diets that are high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (and low in animal fats and red meat) are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, especially fiber-rich veggies like kale, spinach, and broccoli. Leafy greens are packed with fiber and nutrients and benefit the gastrointestinal tract as a whole. Dr. Pigazzi follows a mostly vegetarian diet, eating fish and meat only sparingly. “I’m not here to say that eating a steak once in a while is wrong,” he says.","can cause inflammation, obesity, diabetes, and an increased risk",neutral,"

Experts from the International Association for Research on Cancer Reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was “limited” evidence to suggest that excess red meat consumption caused bowel cancer. For this reason they concluded it was a “probable carcinogen”, but couldn’t conclude exactly how much it increased your cancer risk by – or say how much needed to be consumed to increase the risk. However, there did appear to be an association with increased cancer risk when more than 100g a day was consumed. Processed meats
Evidence suggests that there is a link between excess consumption of processed meats, and cancer risk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has found that consuming excess processed meats is a cause of bowel cancer. Experts concluded that over the long term, consuming a 50g portion of processed meat consumed daily (that’s two slices of bacon) increased the risk of bowel cancer by 18%.",there did appear to be an association with increased cancer risk,neutral,"

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat," The consumption of processed meat was associated with small
increases in the risk of cancer in the studies reviewed. In those
studies, the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed. An analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion
of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer
by about 18%.The cancer risk related to the consumption of red meat is more
difficult to estimate because the evidence that red meat causes cancer
is not as strong. However, if the association of red meat and colorectal
cancer were proven to be causal, data from the same studies suggest
that the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100
gram portion of red meat eaten daily. Is the risk higher in children, in elderly people, in women, or in men? Are some people more at risk?",the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed,neutral,"

And the sort of harm you can come to from slipping on a banana skin isn’t generally as severe as, say, being in a car accident.But under a hazard identification system like IARC’s, ‘banana skins’ and ‘cars’ would come under the same category – they both definitely do cause accidents.To put things in perspective, let’s look at how processed meat stacks up against smoking.Copy this link and share our graphic. Credit: Cancer Research UK How does processed and red meat cause cancer?So far, research has linked 3 chemicals to increased bowel cancer risk. These chemicals are either naturally found in meat, added during processing or produced when cooking:haem (a red pigment found mostly in red meat);nitrates and nitrites (used to keep processed meat fresher for longer); andheterocyclic amines and polycyclic amines (produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures)All 3 can damage the cells in our bowel, and it’s the accumulation of this damage over time that increases cancer risk.How much matters?The latest study analysed data from half a million UK adults over almost 7 years and found that moderate processed and red meat eaters – those eating 79g per day on average – had a 32% increased risk of bowel cancer compared to people eating less than 11g of red and processed meat daily.To put this in context, for every 10,000 people on the study who ate less than 11 grams of red and processed meat a day, 45 were diagnosed with bowel cancer. Eating 79 grams of red and processed meat a day caused 14 extra cases of bowel cancer per 10,000 people. These figures are just for the independent effect of meat consumption, as they take into account other differences between these groups of people, for example sex, deprivation, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, other aspects of diet, reproductive factors, and body mass index.Professor Tim Key, who co-led the recent study and is deputy director at the University of Oxford’s cancer epidemiology unit, says that while the impact of cutting back on processed meat might be smaller than quitting smoking, it’s still important.“Everyone eats and everyone is at risk of colorectal cancer,” he says.",32%,neutral,"

"
Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-eating-processed-red-meats-what-are-the-health-risks/," A recent review of the research regarding red meat consumption looked at six studies that tracked more than 1.5 million people for 5½ to 28 years. The review found that regularly consuming processed meats is associated with increased risk of heart disease, cancer — especially colon cancer — and early death. Processed meats include bacon; sausage; hot dogs; ham; deli meats; canned meats; jerky; and meat that is processed, cured, fermented or salted. These meats tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and nitrates or nitrites, which are thought to be implicated in their associated risks. Processed meat and red meat are abundant sources of protein in the Western diet, so it may seem like cutting down on these would make it difficult to obtain an adequate amount of protein. However, for most healthy adults, the recommended daily value for protein is about 50 grams (5½ ounces), depending on your weight, age, gender and physical activity.","increased risk of heart disease, cancer",neutral,"

Your favorite deli meat sub sandwich from your grocery store's deli counter might come with some serious health concerns. In fact, the World Health Organization has even classified these highly processed meats as ""carcinogenic to humans."" While the reasons for deli meats' cancer-causing properties are not entirely known, many health experts believe it has something to do with the meats' nitrate content, as noted by EatingWell. ""We know that when nitrites combine with the amines in meat, they create nitrosamines, which some studies have found to be carcinogenic,"" Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D.N., told EatingWell. Furthermore, through an analysis of various studies, the World Health Organization ""estimated that every 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by about 18%.""

Can grapefruit interfere with medication?,https://wfamilymedicine.com/health-news/dont-eat-grapefruit-if-youre-taking-these-medications/," Grapefruit contains a compound which interferes with an enzyme in the small intestine, which is responsible for breaking down nearly half of all medicines. As a result, the fruit can make medicines too strong or not strong enough by affecting how well your body absorbs them. Nurse and first aid trainer Emma Hammett, of First Aid For Life, explains in a piece for the Hippocratic Post  how grapefruit could affect your medicines, and when to take extra care. Some medicines have instructions for patients to avoid eating grapefruit or drinking the juice when they’re taking them because a chemical in the fruit can disrupt how well the body absorbs drugs

Can grapefruit interfere with medication?,https://www.diabetescarecommunity.ca/living-well-with-diabetes-articles/medication-articles/oral-diabetes-medications/medication-interactions-with-grapefruit/," According to a review published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, there are approximately 85 different medication interactions with grapefruit. However, the number of drugs that can be risky when taken with grapefruit will likely continue to rise; this is because more and more new medications and chemical formulations are being introduced by pharmaceutical companies.Why does grapefruit interact with some medications? Here’s what happens: Grapefruit contains furanocoumarins, a type of organic chemical compound that inhibits the efficacy of an important enzyme. This enzyme normally helps your body process the medication you take, balancing out how much of it goes into your bloodstream. Because furanocoumarins hinder this enzyme, larger amounts of the drug persist in your bloodstream and medication levels can grow toxic in the body.It’s not just grapefruit, either.",there are approximately 85 different medication interactions with grapefruit,yes,"

Grapefruit oil and medication by Hana Tisserand


Doctors warn against consuming Grapefruit juice if you take certain types of medication, such as statins, which are metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Grapefruit juice inhibits this enzyme so the liver produces less of it, and this affects the action of those drugs – they will be less effective. This is known as a drug interaction. Should you also be careful when using the essential oil? Grapefruit juice interaction is primarily due to dihydroxybergamottin, which is not present in the essential oil.",Grapefruit juice inhibits this enzyme,neutral,"

Can grapefruit interfere with medication?,https://www.pharmacists.org/grapefruit-juice-and-drug-interactions/," Many experts believe that even if grapefruit juice interacts with your medication, it may be safe to drink a small amount. However, it is best to check with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice because everyone’s body is different and could react differently. If your medicine interacts with grapefruit juice, but you absolutely love all things grapefruit and regularly consume large quantities, ask your healthcare provider if an alternative treatment may be more appropriate for you. The Bottom Line
Grapefruit juice, as well as other fruit juices, may affect other medicines you take. Talk to your healthcare provider about all of the medications you take (prescription and OTC) and if fruit juices can affect them. References:

When the enzyme doesn't function normally, medications may not degrade and instead circulate in the blood at higher levels than normal. This can effectively cause a medication overdose. ""Taking one tablet with a glass of grapefruit juice is like taking five tablets with water,"" Bailey says. Popular drugs that interact negatively with grapefruit include various antibiotics, as well as drugs that treat hypertension, high cholesterol, and cancer. The study notes that grapefruits are not the only fruits to cause problems with medications: Seville oranges, pomelos, and limes also contain the same family of disruptive compounds.",This can effectively cause a medication overdose,neutral,"

This interaction could be less severe, simply rendering your allergy meds useless, or it could cause something resembling a withdrawal experience. This grapefruit-related phenomenon was initially reported in a 1989 study investigating the potential interactions between ethanol and felodipine, a drug used to treat blood pressure, says Kelly Johnson-Arbor, MD, FACEP, FUHM, FACMT, medical toxicologist and co-medical director of National Capital Poison Center. In this study, participants were given a placebo or ethanol mixed with grapefruit juice to mask the taste, followed by a dose of the blood pressure drug.

Traits[edit]
The interaction between citrus and medication depends on the individual drug, and not the class of the drug. Drugs that interact usually share three common features: they are taken orally, normally only a small amount enters systemic blood circulation, and they are metabolized by CYP3A4. [1] However, the effects on the CYP3A4 in the liver could in principle cause interactions with non-oral drugs,[citation needed] and non-CYP3A4-mediated effects also exist. [29]
Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components include CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. [21] Drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes may have interactions with components of grapefruit.",The interaction between citrus and medication depends on the individual drug,neutral,"

Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-diabetes," The larger the banana, the more carbs you’ll consume and the greater the rise in your blood sugar will be.Are bananas safe for those with diabetes?Most general dietary guidelines for diabetes recommend following a healthy, balanced diet that includes fruit (22, 23, 24).This is because eating fruits and vegetables has been linked to better health and a lower risk of conditions such as heart disease and some cancers (25, 26, 27, 28). People living with diabetes are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (29, 30, 31, 32). Unlike refined sugar products such as candy and cake, the carbs in fruits like bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (33).For most people with diabetes, fruits — including bananas — are a healthy choice.However, some people who are following low carb diets need to watch their total carbohydrate intake to stay within their daily carb allotment. This means foods higher in carbs, including bananas, have to be limited on low carb diets.If your doctor says you can eat bananas, it’s important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of a banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.SummaryFruits like bananas are healthy foods that contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Depending on a person’s meal plan and nutritional needs, a doctor or dietitian may recommend swapping out carbs in a later meal.Alternatively, after eating a meal that is lighter on carbs, a person can enjoy a small banana as a snack to balance their carb intake.Do bananas raise blood pressure?Bananas are rich in potassium, an important micronutrient that can support healthy blood pressure levels.In fact, one study found that frequent consumption of several types of fruit, including bananas, was linked to lower blood pressure levels.Furthermore, some research suggests that a potassium-rich diet could reduce the risk of stroke — a condition that is often the result of high blood pressure — by around 25%. NutritionOverall, bananas are nutrient-dense, low in saturated fat and sodium, and rich in fiber.They are also a key source of potassium, a mineral that helps balance sodium levels in the blood.Bananas provide a good mix of other nutrients, including:vitamin B6manganesemagnesiumvitamin CWho should avoid bananas?Individuals with diabetes can enjoy bananas and other fruits in moderation as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.However, a person should be sure to consult a doctor or dietitian before making any changes to their diet plan, especially if they are taking medications for diabetes or other health conditions.For instance, certain medications used to treat high blood pressure can increase levels of potassium in the blood, which could cause negative side effects if paired with a high potassium diet.Additionally, people with chronic kidney disease may need to limit their intake of potassium-rich foods such as bananas to prevent an increase in blood potassium levels.TakeawayA person with diabetes should include a variety of fresh, whole foods in their diet, such as nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables.Bananas are a safe and nutritious fruit for people with diabetes to eat in moderation as part of a balanced, individualized eating plan.For a more precise diet plan or personalized recommendations, it is a good idea to consult a registered dietitian or diabetes specialist.Q:I know bananas contain a lot of potassium. Does this help reduce the effects of diabetes?A:Potassium is an important nutrient for many processes in the body, such as regulating nerve signals, balancing fluid levels, and supporting muscle contraction.Potassium can be helpful in decreasing complications from diabetes and managing comorbidities, including high blood pressure.It is an important nutrient for decreasing cardiovascular risks, which are often present in those with poorly managed diabetes.

These human studies have tried to see whether heavy users of cell phones have higher rates of brain cancers and other health problems compared with people who use cell phones less often. All that research—in test tubes, animals, and humans—has been mixed, with no definitive proof that cell-phone radiation harms human health, but also unable to completely clear it of any potential risk. The research into the RF signals used with WiFi is even more preliminary, focused on lab and animal studies, making it even more difficult to reach firm conclusions about their safety or risk. But researchers can make some judgments about the potential for harm based on how WiFi and similar technologies work, as well as on how people tend to use their devices. Those factors do provide some reasons to think that WiFi and Bluetooth devices may be less of a concern, says Leeka Kheifets, Ph.D., a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health who has studied the potential health effects of low-level radiation.",less of a concern,no,"

Answer by Gary Larson, Medical Director at Procure Proton Therapy Center, PI for Proton Collab Grp-OKC, on Quora:
WiFi operates in the 2 to 5 GHz range -- part of the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is in the same part of the spectrum where cell phones operate so I may refer to WiFi or cellphone electromagnetic radiation interchangeably. These are radio waves -- no different from those used to broadcast television programs, except that they are higher in frequency. They aren't nearly as high a frequency as visible light, and no one worries about getting cancer from visible light (ultraviolet light, on the other hand, causes skin cancer, but this is the minimum energy necessary to cause ionizations that can cause breaks in strands of DNA, which is the mechanism by which cancer cells can be created).

 There are many articles on the Internet suggesting that a Wi-Fi router poses potential health risks while others negate it. Scientists and researchers are still studying the effects of long-term electromagnetic radiation. Some experts say that wireless routers and allied systems produce radiation in low GHz frequency, which is potentially dangerous even when it is within the so-called ‘safe limits’ set by some countries. As the RF radiations could still cause harmful or non-thermal biological problems, we should understand the risks associated with Wi-Fi radiation from our own routers and those installed by our neighbours, offices, or even in public places. vias next to a pad, in some cases even by removing some pads from the BGA footprint.",poses potential health risks,neutral,"

This may naturally lead to lower calorie intake. However, it could worsen gastroparesis for some.It may help you lose weight and body fatResults from a small but widely cited 2009 study indicate that apple cider vinegar has impressive effects on weight and body fat (7).In this 12-week study, 144 Japanese adults with obesity consumed either 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vinegar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, or a placebo drink every day.They were told to restrict their alcohol intake but otherwise continue their usual diet and activity throughout the study.Participants who consumed 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day had — on average — the following benefits:Weight loss: 2.6 pounds (lb), or 1.2 kilograms (kg)Decrease in body fat percentage: 18%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.5 inches (in), or 1.4 centimeters (cm)Decrease in triglycerides: 26%This is what changed in participants who consumed 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day:Weight loss: 4.2 lb, or 1.7 kgDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in, or 1.9 cmDecrease in triglycerides: 26%The placebo group actually gained 0.9 lb (0.4 kg), and their waist circumference slightly increased.In a 2018 clinical trial involving 39 participants on restricted calorie diets, those who consumed about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar (8).According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your body fat percentage, help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood triglycerides.These are two of only a few human studies that have investigated apple cider vinegar’s effects on weight loss. Although the results are encouraging, additional studies are needed.SummaryIn two studies, people with obesity who took 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost weight and body fat.Other health benefitsIn addition to promoting weight and fat loss, apple cider vinegar has several other benefits:Lowers blood sugar and insulin: When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating (4).Improves insulin sensitivity: Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal may improve insulin sensitivity (9).Lowers fasting blood sugar: Studies have found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (10).Improves polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms: In a small 2013 study of women with PCOS who took vinegar for 90–110 days, 57% resumed ovulation, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity (11).Decreases cholesterol levels: A 2021 research review of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides (12).Lowers blood pressure: Animal studies suggest that vinegar may decrease blood pressure by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for constricting blood vessels.

   The Science Behind Ginger and Nausea  

Ginger for nausea works directly on the stomach and is thought to increase the movement of the GI tract. A 2005 report from Obstetrics and Gynecology analyzed six clinical trials (with a total of 675 participants) and found that ginger was superior to a placebo and similar to vitamin B6 in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.﻿﻿



In addition, in a 2006 report from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, investigators sized up five clinical trials (with a total of 363 patients) and concluded that taking ginger is more effective than placebo for post-surgery nausea and vomiting.﻿﻿



In 2012, another study reported in Integrated Cancer Therapy found that ginger was effective in reducing nausea caused by chemotherapy. Ginger was administered to women being treated for advanced breast cancer; the study found that "" A significantly lower prevalence of nausea was observed in the ginger group during 6 to 24 hours post chemotherapy.

Can a cold sore cause genital herpes?,https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2016-09-16/cold-sores-and-genital-herpes/7537050," (iStockPhoto)Help keep family & friends informed by sharing this articleabc.net.au/news/cold-sores-and-genital-herpes/7537050Copy linkShareAsk anyone who gets cold sores and they'll tell you how unpleasant these little sores and blisters can be.Key points:The same virus that causes cold sores can also cause genital herpes and it can happen even if there are no symptomsPreviously HSV type 1 was common near the mouth and HSV type 2 mostly affected the genitalsBut HSV type 1 is now also common near the genitalsCold sores, which usually appear on your lips or the skin around your mouth, are also known as oral herpes and are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). This virus is also responsible for blisters and sores in the genital area, known as genital herpes.So if you have cold sores, is it possible to give your partner genital herpes?Unfortunately, the short answer is yes, according to sexual health physician Terri Foran.To understand why — the first thing you need to know is that there are two types of HSV. In the past, HSV type 1 (HSV-1) was most commonly seen on the lips (usually as cold sores), while HSV type 2 (HSV-2) preferred the genital area.However, in recent years doctors have seen more cases of genital herpes caused by HSV-1. If you have oral HSV-1 and your partner doesn't, you can spread it through any type of sexual contact where the mouth comes into contact with their mouth or their genitals — and sometimes the buttocks and legs as well. This explains why some people have the same type of herpes on both their lips and their genitals.More alarmingly, Dr Foran said you don't even need to have any outward sign of cold sores to spread the virus. Perfectly normal looking skin can still shed lots of viral particles — sometimes even more than when the blisters are actually present.Who gets herpes?Lots of people have cold sores, and lots of people have oral sex — so why don't more of us get genital herpes?The reason is because during childhood, most of us (perhaps 80 per cent) are exposed to type 1 of the herpes virus, Dr Foran said.",it can happen even if there are no symptomsPreviously,neutral,"
