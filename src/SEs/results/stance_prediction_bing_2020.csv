And, unfortunately, most of the evidence is unconvincing.

TORONTO -- 
	Reports that hospitals are turning to high doses of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with severe cases of COVID-19 have reignited claims that the vitamin can prevent or cure cases of the novel coronavirus. Though vitamin C has long been touted as an immune-boosting vitamin, experts warn that its potential for treating coronavirus has not been proven. In fact, there is conflicting evidence to support the vitamin’s use as a treatment for the common cold or flu. Here is what you need to know about the claims involving vitamin C and COVID-19:

IS HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN C BEING USED TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS? Yes, some critically ill patients have been treated with high-dose intravenous vitamin C. However, there has yet to be any clear scientific evidence that this is an effective treatment for the virus. A study involving 140 coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the virus, is currently underway to determine the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in patients with severe acute respiratory infections.",Nicole Bogart,neutral,"

Briefly summarised, high-dose vitamin C has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve oxygen support status, and reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients, all without causing any negative side effects. Additionally, it may be beneficial for specific subgroups of patients with severe and critical condition, as well as for older individuals. High-dose vitamin C may prove to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to investigate the direct relationship between serum/plasma nutritional C levels and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection.AbbreviationsCOVID-19Coronavirus disease 2019FDAFood and Drug AdministrationARDSAdult respiratory distress syndromeEBVEpstein–Barr virusCMVCytomegalovirusHSV-1Herpes simplex virus-1HIVHuman immunodeficiency virusRCTRandomised controlled trialIVIntravenousVZVVaricella zoster virusURTIUpper respiratory tract infectionICUIntensive care unitAIDSAcquired Immune Deficiency SyndromeSODsuperoxide dismutaseGSH-PXGlutathione peroxidaseCATCatalase enzymeNO3Nitric oxideHDIVCHigh dose intravenous vitamin CFootnotesConflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.References1.

Examples – including some referring to the recovery of an elderly lady in China, and others promoting fruits such as oranges that are high in Vitamin C - can be seen here , here , here , and here .Vitamin C, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) “plays an important role in immune function” (here).However, it is false to suggest that Vitamin C is a widely approved treatment or cure for COVID-19. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved” ( here ).A World Health Organization (WHO) document prescribes several methods for trained healthcare professionals to use in managing severe cases of COVID-19 ( bit.ly/2VxMu9B ). These include oxygen therapy and monitoring, the treatment of co-infections with empiric antimicrobials, endotracheal intubation in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and resuscitation from septic shock using crystalloid fluid. As of mid-April, the guide does not mention use of Vitamin C.Guidelines on inpatient management from the Infectious Diseases Society of America can be found here . These also do not mention treatment with vitamins.As reported by Newsweek, “patients testing positive with COVID-19 were in some cases being treated with large doses of vitamin C” in the intensive care units of certain New York hospitals ( here ).",Vitamin C alone is an effective cure or treatment,neutral,"

Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus? Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection. I have written before that using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up. Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health.",unlikely,neutral,"

Even if intravenous vitamin C works to shorten or cure COVID-19, it will likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, take over. The most effective way to avoid the virus still remains washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and keeping your distance from anyone exhibiting symptoms.

Though high dose IV vitamin C is currently being tested to see if it can improve lung function in people with COVID-19, no evidence suggests that high doses of oral vitamin C supplements can help with the disease. In fact, they can cause complications like diarrhea (2).SummaryHigh dose IV vitamin C has been used in China to help improve lung function in people with COVID-19. However, vitamin C’s effectiveness is still being tested. There’s no evidence to support the use of oral vitamin C supplements for COVID-19.Do you need to supplement?Currently, no evidence supports the use of oral vitamin C supplements to prevent COVID-19.Vitamin C may help shorten the duration and severity of colds caused by other viruses, but this is no guarantee that it will have the same effect on the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Additionally, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. It dissolves in water, meaning that excess amounts aren’t stored in your body but instead eliminated through your urine.",no evidence supports the use of oral vitamin C supplements,neutral,"

TORONTO -- 
	Reports that hospitals are turning to high doses of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with severe cases of COVID-19 have reignited claims that the vitamin can prevent or cure cases of the novel coronavirus. Though vitamin C has long been touted as an immune-boosting vitamin, experts warn that its potential for treating coronavirus has not been proven. In fact, there is conflicting evidence to support the vitamin’s use as a treatment for the common cold or flu. Here is what you need to know about the claims involving vitamin C and COVID-19:

IS HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN C BEING USED TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS? Yes, some critically ill patients have been treated with high-dose intravenous vitamin C. However, there has yet to be any clear scientific evidence that this is an effective treatment for the virus. A study involving 140 coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the virus, is currently underway to determine the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in patients with severe acute respiratory infections.",Nicole Bogart,neutral,"

Briefly summarised, high-dose vitamin C has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve oxygen support status, and reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients, all without causing any negative side effects. Additionally, it may be beneficial for specific subgroups of patients with severe and critical condition, as well as for older individuals. High-dose vitamin C may prove to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to investigate the direct relationship between serum/plasma nutritional C levels and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection.AbbreviationsCOVID-19Coronavirus disease 2019FDAFood and Drug AdministrationARDSAdult respiratory distress syndromeEBVEpstein–Barr virusCMVCytomegalovirusHSV-1Herpes simplex virus-1HIVHuman immunodeficiency virusRCTRandomised controlled trialIVIntravenousVZVVaricella zoster virusURTIUpper respiratory tract infectionICUIntensive care unitAIDSAcquired Immune Deficiency SyndromeSODsuperoxide dismutaseGSH-PXGlutathione peroxidaseCATCatalase enzymeNO3Nitric oxideHDIVCHigh dose intravenous vitamin CFootnotesConflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.References1.

Examples – including some referring to the recovery of an elderly lady in China, and others promoting fruits such as oranges that are high in Vitamin C - can be seen here , here , here , and here .Vitamin C, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) “plays an important role in immune function” (here).However, it is false to suggest that Vitamin C is a widely approved treatment or cure for COVID-19. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved” ( here ).A World Health Organization (WHO) document prescribes several methods for trained healthcare professionals to use in managing severe cases of COVID-19 ( bit.ly/2VxMu9B ). These include oxygen therapy and monitoring, the treatment of co-infections with empiric antimicrobials, endotracheal intubation in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and resuscitation from septic shock using crystalloid fluid. As of mid-April, the guide does not mention use of Vitamin C.Guidelines on inpatient management from the Infectious Diseases Society of America can be found here . These also do not mention treatment with vitamins.As reported by Newsweek, “patients testing positive with COVID-19 were in some cases being treated with large doses of vitamin C” in the intensive care units of certain New York hospitals ( here ).",Vitamin C alone is an effective cure or treatment,neutral,"

Even if intravenous vitamin C works to shorten or cure COVID-19, it will likely only be a stop-gap before therapies directed at the virus, such as vaccinations, take over. The most effective way to avoid the virus still remains washing hands, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and keeping your distance from anyone exhibiting symptoms.

We hypothesized that BCG vaccine may control SARS-CoV2 infection via modulating the monocyte immune response. We analyzed GSE104149 dataset to investigate whether human monocytes of BCG-vaccinated individuals acquire resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentially expressed genes obtained from the dataset were used to determine enriched pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions for monocytes post BCG vaccination. Our data show that BCG vaccine promotes a more effective immune response of monocytes against SARS-CoV2, but probably not sufficient to prevent the infection. Keywords:

                  The BCG vaccine given to every British teenager between 1953 and 2005 to protect against tuberculosis could offer protection against Covid-19, a new study has found. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was first mass produced in 1924, and widespread vaccination for secondary school children was only halted in the UK when TB was effectively eradicated.Academics in the US compared the BCG jab's popularity in several countries with each nation's coronavirus outbreak — including both infections and deaths — and found a clear link between the vaccine and a lower mortality rate from Covid-19.When differences in social, economic, and demographics were taken into account, scientists found that where there was a 10 per cent greater prevalence of the BCG vaccine there was also a 10.4 per cent reduction in COVID-19 mortality. This suggests that in the UK, adults aged between 30 and 80 who were given the jab at school may have a greater level of protection.

We hypothesized that BCG vaccine may control SARS-CoV2 infection via modulating the monocyte immune response. We analyzed GSE104149 dataset to investigate whether human monocytes of BCG-vaccinated individuals acquire resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentially expressed genes obtained from the dataset were used to determine enriched pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions for monocytes post BCG vaccination. Our data show that BCG vaccine promotes a more effective immune response of monocytes against SARS-CoV2, but probably not sufficient to prevent the infection. Keywords:

Century-old BCG vaccine used to eradicate tuberculosis DOES 'reduce the chance of death from Covid-19', study confirmsPrevious studies suggested the BCG vaccine offers protection from Covid-19 US researchers conducted a comprehensive review and found a clear linkSay it is currently impossible to determine if it is causative or just a correlation But countries with a 10 per cent greater prevalence of the BCG vaccine also had a 10.4 per cent reduction in COVID-19 mortalityBy Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline   Published:  10:36 GMT, 10 July 2020   |  Updated:  19:23 GMT, 10 July 2020

                  The BCG vaccine given to every British teenager between 1953 and 2005 to protect against tuberculosis could offer protection against Covid-19, a new study has found. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was first mass produced in 1924, and widespread vaccination for secondary school children was only halted in the UK when TB was effectively eradicated.Academics in the US compared the BCG jab's popularity in several countries with each nation's coronavirus outbreak — including both infections and deaths — and found a clear link between the vaccine and a lower mortality rate from Covid-19.When differences in social, economic, and demographics were taken into account, scientists found that where there was a 10 per cent greater prevalence of the BCG vaccine there was also a 10.4 per cent reduction in COVID-19 mortality. This suggests that in the UK, adults aged between 30 and 80 who were given the jab at school may have a greater level of protection. Scroll down for video           The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine (pictured) is used to fend off tuberculosis (TB) but it has long been known to have other health benefits, including helping a person's immune system to fend off respiratory infectionsChildren in the UK were required to have the injection by the age of 14, making the last cohort to receive the immune-boosting jab around 29 to 30 now. BCG is still widely used in some countries around the world where there is a higher risk of TB, but in the UK only at-risk individuals, such as babies living with infected relatives and children in some BAME groups, receive the jab.",10.4 per cent reduction in COVID-19 mortality,neutral,"

Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its stance on taking ibuprofen if you have COVID-19, but people are still scratching their heads over what they should take if or when they contract the virus.After previously announcing that people with the virus shouldn’t take ibuprofen to treat pain and fever, the WHO now says they don’t advise against it. The flip-flopping has a lot of people confused — especially those stocking up on medication in anticipation of getting the virus.Dr. Otto O. Yang, a professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Healthline there’s no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening of COVID-19, “although there is circulating misinformation to that effect.”Fever (medication) frenzyThe concern began after a study in The Lancet stated that ibuprofen boosts the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which may facilitate and worsen COVID-19. As a result, WHO originally warned most patients to stick with acetaminophen, which is also known as paracetamol or Tylenol.Patients likely have increased ACE2 expression if they’re treated with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), or thiazolidinediones, the report noted.",no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening,neutral,"

PARIS (AFP) — Taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen does not increase the risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 or of dying from it, according to a new study, the largest so far on this class of medicines. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. But observational research published Saturday in the medical journal Lancet Rheumatology, based on 72,000 hospitalized patients, found that the drugs “do not increase the mortality or severity” of COVID-19. The authors recommended that doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs as they have in the past. “When the pandemic began over a year ago, we needed to be sure that these common medications would not lead to worse outcomes in people with COVID-19,” lead author Ewen Harrison, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said in a press release.",Ibuprofen does not worsen COVID-19 symptoms,neutral,"

The flip-flopping has a lot of people confused — especially those stocking up on medication in anticipation of getting the virus.Dr. Otto O. Yang, a professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Healthline there’s no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening of COVID-19, “although there is circulating misinformation to that effect.”Fever (medication) frenzyThe concern began after a study in The Lancet stated that ibuprofen boosts the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which may facilitate and worsen COVID-19. As a result, WHO originally warned most patients to stick with acetaminophen, which is also known as paracetamol or Tylenol.Patients likely have increased ACE2 expression if they’re treated with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), or thiazolidinediones, the report noted.",no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening,neutral,"

Taking an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or paracetamol will bring down a high temperature by lowering some of the fever molecules.However, doctors who compared the two in 2013 suggested taking paracetamol over ibuprofen for normal chest infections because they found a small number of people's illness got worse with ibuprofen.Cause for concern?Some of the reasons that there's a concern taking ibuprofen will make COVID-19 symptoms worse comes from previous studies that have shown people with other serious chest infections (such as pneumonia) experienced worse symptoms and prolonged illness after taking an NSAID, including ibuprofen. But it's difficult to say if taking ibuprofen in these instances directly causes worse symptoms and prolonged illness, or if it's because ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories help manage pain, which may hide how serious the illness is and could stop people from asking for help earlier – delaying treatment.Or, it might be to do with ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory effects. One theory is that anti-inflammatory medicines can interfere with some of the body's immune response, although this is not proven for ibuprofen.However, two French studies warn doctors and pharmacists not to give NSAIDs when they see signs of chest infections, and that NSAIDs shouldn't be given when children are infected with viruses.There's no agreement on why ibuprofen could make chest infections worse, but both studies reported worse outcomes in patients who had taken a NSAID to treat their condition. A recent letter to The Lancet suggested that ibuprofen's harm in COVID-19 is to do with its effect on an enzyme in the body called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – though this has yet to be proven. This caused additional worries for patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for existing heart conditions.Several leading organisations have rightly warned patients not to stop taking their regular medicines in light of unconfirmed theories.Because novel coronavirus is a new type of virus, there is currently no evidence proving that taking ibuprofen will be harmful or make COVID-19 symptoms worse.",taking ibuprofen will make COVID-19 symptoms worse,neutral,"

""""In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That's important,"" he said.He added that if ibuprofen had been ""prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that's up to them. ""His comments came after Veran sent a tweet cautioning that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be ""an aggravating factor"" in COVID-19 infections. ""In the case of fever, take paracetamol,"" he wrote.The French minister stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should ask advice from their doctor.Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.Video: Vaccination and the Immune SystemThe COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected around 190,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,800, causes mild symptoms in most people, but can result in pneumonia and in some cases severe illness that can lead to multiple organ failure.Even before the pandemic, French authorities sounded the alarm over serious ""infectious complications"" linked to the use of ibuprofen, which is sold under various brands like Nurofen and Advil, and other anti-inflammatory drugs.A spokesperson for British pharmaceutical company Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen, said in an email statement that the company was aware of concerns raised about ""the use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) products, including ibuprofen, for the alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms. ""Story continuesâ€œConsumer safety is our number one priority,"" the spokesperson said, stressing that ""Ibuprofen is a well-established medicine that has been used safely as a self-care fever and pain reducer, including in viral illnesses, for more than 30 years.","could be ""an aggravating factor",no,"

Full Story 
It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.",there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,no,"

Thus, it is easy to dislodge the virus through gargling and nasal irrigation by salt water. However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help.A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore.They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a ""compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation. This method is simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategy with therapeutic and prophylactic value"".According to the researchers, the common salt (sodium chloride) present in saline water inhibits replication of a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus.",gargling does not help,neutral,"

Researchers at Edinburgh University trialled saltwater gargling and 'nasal irrigation' in a trial on people with upper respiratory tract infections, otherwise known as coughs and colds, and found it reduced their symptoms and the length of their illness.Their study, published in the journal Scientific Reports last year, found 93 per cent of people said gargling reduced their symptoms, their illnesses lasted two days less, on average, and they were 35 per cent less likely to pass it on to a family member.Scientists hope the cheap, simple therapy could have similar benefits for people with the coronavirus, reducing the severity of their cough and preventing the illness from worsening.Explaining how the salt could achieve this effect, the study said direct contact with salt may have a toxic effect on the viruses themselves and damage or kill them.It may also stimulate 'innate immune mechanisms' inside cells in the airways, they suggested, effectively boosting the body's own ability to fight off infection.Salt may also be soaked up and used by the body's cells to create a chemical called hypochlorous acid which is found in bleach and known to kill viruses, the researchers said.

 'It only requires salt, water and some understanding of [gargling] procedure, so should, if found to be effective, be easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely. 'The study is open only to adults living in Scotland who have symptoms of Covid-19 or have recently received a positive test for the virus.It is expected to operate similarly to the previous one in which some participants will gargle salt water while others down, with all of them following the same lockdown rules.In the cough and cold study people kept diaries of their symptoms for two weeks and reported back to the scientists, who compared which group fared best.The NHS currently only has treatments for coronavirus patients who are seriously ill, and those still do not work for everyone. One is the steroid dexamethasone, which a study found could cut death rates in intensive care patients by up to a third.And the second is an Ebola drug called remdesivir, which has shown promising results in shortening recovery times. Both are approved for NHS use specifically for Covid-19 patients - for much of the UK's outbreak doctors were limited to experimenting with whatever antiviral drugs and antibiotics they could find.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the trial success of dexamethasone - which was announced on June 16 - as the 'biggest breakthrough yet' in treating coronavirus.He said at a press conference: 'I'm absolutely delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK... 'I think there is genuine cause to celebrate a remarkable British scientific achievement [and] the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world.",easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely,neutral,"

Full Story 
It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.",there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,no,"

Thus, it is easy to dislodge the virus through gargling and nasal irrigation by salt water. However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help.A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore.They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a ""compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation. This method is simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategy with therapeutic and prophylactic value"".According to the researchers, the common salt (sodium chloride) present in saline water inhibits replication of a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus.",gargling does not help,neutral,"

Researchers at Edinburgh University trialled saltwater gargling and 'nasal irrigation' in a trial on people with upper respiratory tract infections, otherwise known as coughs and colds, and found it reduced their symptoms and the length of their illness.Their study, published in the journal Scientific Reports last year, found 93 per cent of people said gargling reduced their symptoms, their illnesses lasted two days less, on average, and they were 35 per cent less likely to pass it on to a family member.Scientists hope the cheap, simple therapy could have similar benefits for people with the coronavirus, reducing the severity of their cough and preventing the illness from worsening.Explaining how the salt could achieve this effect, the study said direct contact with salt may have a toxic effect on the viruses themselves and damage or kill them.It may also stimulate 'innate immune mechanisms' inside cells in the airways, they suggested, effectively boosting the body's own ability to fight off infection.Salt may also be soaked up and used by the body's cells to create a chemical called hypochlorous acid which is found in bleach and known to kill viruses, the researchers said.

 'It only requires salt, water and some understanding of [gargling] procedure, so should, if found to be effective, be easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely. 'The study is open only to adults living in Scotland who have symptoms of Covid-19 or have recently received a positive test for the virus.It is expected to operate similarly to the previous one in which some participants will gargle salt water while others down, with all of them following the same lockdown rules.In the cough and cold study people kept diaries of their symptoms for two weeks and reported back to the scientists, who compared which group fared best.The NHS currently only has treatments for coronavirus patients who are seriously ill, and those still do not work for everyone. One is the steroid dexamethasone, which a study found could cut death rates in intensive care patients by up to a third.And the second is an Ebola drug called remdesivir, which has shown promising results in shortening recovery times. Both are approved for NHS use specifically for Covid-19 patients - for much of the UK's outbreak doctors were limited to experimenting with whatever antiviral drugs and antibiotics they could find.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the trial success of dexamethasone - which was announced on June 16 - as the 'biggest breakthrough yet' in treating coronavirus.He said at a press conference: 'I'm absolutely delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK... 'I think there is genuine cause to celebrate a remarkable British scientific achievement [and] the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world.",easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely,neutral,"

Honey, ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment for Covid-19
12 May 2021









What was claimed
Honey, pepper and ginger can ‘100%’ eliminate the effect of Covid-19 and has been approved by the WHO. Our verdict
This treatment for Covid-19 has not been approved by the WHO. The WHO says that although some spices may be beneficial for health, there is no evidence that this particular mix can protect from Covid-19 infection. Readers have asked us to fact check a widely shared WhatsApp message which claims that a student at the University of Pondicherry in India has found a home remedy for Covid-19. The message claims that the remedy, which includes pepper powder, honey and ginger juice can “eliminate the effect of corona up to 100%” and has been “approved by the WHO [World Health Organisation]”. In fact, rather than endorsing this remedy, the WHO has said the exact opposite.",ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment,neutral,"

Honey, ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment for Covid-19
12 May 2021









What was claimed
Honey, pepper and ginger can ‘100%’ eliminate the effect of Covid-19 and has been approved by the WHO. Our verdict
This treatment for Covid-19 has not been approved by the WHO. The WHO says that although some spices may be beneficial for health, there is no evidence that this particular mix can protect from Covid-19 infection. Readers have asked us to fact check a widely shared WhatsApp message which claims that a student at the University of Pondicherry in India has found a home remedy for Covid-19. The message claims that the remedy, which includes pepper powder, honey and ginger juice can “eliminate the effect of corona up to 100%” and has been “approved by the WHO [World Health Organisation]”. In fact, rather than endorsing this remedy, the WHO has said the exact opposite.",ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment,neutral,"

And, such radiation can’t cause COVID-19. COVID-19 is a viral disease that comes from the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of similar myths in the future, experts need to consistently and clearly correct common misconceptions. And better transparency from both government bodies and researchers could prevent misinformation from ever taking root. “We [researchers] need to humanize the conversations around misinformation and continue to share true information so that misinformation becomes less prevalent in the media,” said Nsoesie.

PODGORICA, 11 JULY 2021 – Almost one-third of the citizens of Montenegro (31%) believe that 5G technology causes or spreads coronavirus and that this is being kept secret so that the companies dealing with this technology can continue to make a significant profit. This is one of the findings from a March survey on a nationally representative sample conducted by the research agency Ipsos, with the support of the British Embassy in Podgorica and UNICEF. UNICEF's Young Reporters analysed this conspiracy theory in Montenegro to check if there was any truth in it. Their analysis is available on UNICEF Montenegro's website and it shows that the fifth generation of mobile internet does not kill the living world or spread coronavirus. Younger citizens aged 18–44 years, as well as citizens with higher education, believe this conspiracy theory less often.",5G technology does not cause or spread coronavirus,no,"

But there’s one thing you can permanently take off your concern list: 5G has no causal connection to COVID-19, contrary to several recent misguided online rumors. In fact, according to a seven-year-long scientific study published just this month, 5G has no detrimental health effects in general.But it’s worth examining why 5G can’t possibly be related to the coronavirus from a scientific and factual perspective and why it isn’t a health concern in general. Plus, along the way, you might learn a little bit more about how 5G and cellphones work.As with many other conspiracy theories, the supposed 5G coronavirus connection came from uninformed people on the internet trying to link things that are not at all connected.

And, such radiation can’t cause COVID-19. COVID-19 is a viral disease that comes from the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of similar myths in the future, experts need to consistently and clearly correct common misconceptions. And better transparency from both government bodies and researchers could prevent misinformation from ever taking root. “We [researchers] need to humanize the conversations around misinformation and continue to share true information so that misinformation becomes less prevalent in the media,” said Nsoesie.

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",neutral,"

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Azar also did not mention what the actual mortality rate in the cohort being studied was.Even if convalescent plasma does prove to be an effective treatment for Covid-19, experts are warning that supplies of the product will be limited, due to the need for donors who have recovered from the virus to give blood. Furthermore, the number of antibodies in recovered patients' blood appears to fall fairly rapidly in many individuals, meaning the blood of patients who recovered some time ago may not contain enough antibodies to produce effective plasma.

In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",neutral,"

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19















WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Azar also did not mention what the actual mortality rate in the cohort being studied was.Even if convalescent plasma does prove to be an effective treatment for Covid-19, experts are warning that supplies of the product will be limited, due to the need for donors who have recovered from the virus to give blood. Furthermore, the number of antibodies in recovered patients' blood appears to fall fairly rapidly in many individuals, meaning the blood of patients who recovered some time ago may not contain enough antibodies to produce effective plasma.

In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection.

In this review, the authors have presented positive reports of pneumococcal immunization in COVID-19 individuals with underlying medical problems. Despite the fact that the WHO has stated that bacterial vaccination does not protect against COVID-19 pneumonia, the authors have demonstrated that there is a correlation between pneumococcal disease and COVID-19 in terms of preventing increased morbidity and mortality from secondary infections and superinfections. The authors discussed why pneumococcal vaccination is important in the current pandemic context to improve the global health system in the fight against COVID-19.

How pneumococcal vaccination protects against COVID-19
Protection against serious COVID-19 disease by pneumococcal and Hib vaccines makes sense for several reasons. First, recent studies reveal that the majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in some studies nearly all, are infected with streptococci, which causes pneumococcal pneumonias, Hib or other pneumonia-causing bacteria. Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Protection against serious COVID-19 disease,no,"

ROBERT AMLER ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONSThe question stems from the knowledge that coronavirus can cause respiratory infections. The symptoms range from mild -- such as runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and fatigue -- but in more severe cases can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, kidney failure and even death, according to the American Lung Association.Dr. Robert Amler, formerly a medical epidemiologist and agency chief medical officer at CDC told Fox News on Monday that a pneumonia shot to prevent against this particular respiratory infection will not be effective in staving off pneumonia caused by coronavirus.Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not protect against coronavirus, which is a newly discovered virus with no vaccine or cure to date, according to the World Health Organization.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPDespite this, Almer says that viral pneumonia, which can be made more severe by a bacterial infection in the lungs, can be combated by the shot, which is why it is still advised to get the necessary vaccinations against respiratory illnesses.

How pneumococcal vaccination protects against COVID-19
Protection against serious COVID-19 disease by pneumococcal and Hib vaccines makes sense for several reasons. First, recent studies reveal that the majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in some studies nearly all, are infected with streptococci, which causes pneumococcal pneumonias, Hib or other pneumonia-causing bacteria. Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Protection against serious COVID-19 disease,no,"

Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women.

Injection with the female hormone progesterone could improve outcomes for men hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infections, a study has concluded (stock image)The research was undertaken by pulmonologist Sara Ghandehari of the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles and her colleagues. 'As an ICU doctor, I was struck by the gender disparity among COVID-19 patients who were very sick, remained in the hospital and needed ventilators,' she said. Progesterone is produced in both men and women's bodies, although the latter produce considerably more of the hormone during their reproductive years. Experts have also noted that premenopausal women tend to experience less severe cases of COVID-19 than their postmenopausal counterparts.Premenopausal women tend to have higher progesterone levels while such tends to decrease to lower levels post-menopause.",Injecting MEN with the female hormone progesterone,no,"

When the newer transdermal oestrogen HRT – a £4-a-month gel or patch – is used, it’s been proven to protect women from heart attacks, osteoporosis, diabetes, colon cancer and memory loss, as well as stopping hot flushes. Why not Covid-19 too?The good news is that it might. A recent study of more than 5,451 deaths in women from 465 GP practices in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners database showed that women who were using any form of HRT were 78% less likely to die of Covid. Of course, there’s a slight healthy user bias for women who opt to take HRT, but that’s still a mighty protective effect.A number of patients of menopausal age have been treated privately with HRT and their Covid symptoms have disappearedIn September, the Zoe Covid Symptom Study app showed that women on the contraceptive pill were less likely to catch the virus. Later, a TriNetX global database survey from 17 countries, showed women taking oestrogen HRT were 50% less likely to die of the virus.The science on oestrogen is not all there yet – we need more extensive studies as we follow the trail from hospital to patients at home with long Covid.",it might,neutral,"

In fact, experts have found significant increases in depression both in the short term and in the longer term, nearly 20 years later, in women who had unintended pregnancies.It is worth noting that emerging studies show that women are already at a higher risk of mental health concerns as a result of caring for patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings. This is due to the fact that women tend to dominate healthcare roles.In addition, women provide “unseen” and unpaid care in families, which contributes to this strain. According to a policy brief from the United Nations (UN), “Before COVID-19 became a universal pandemic, women were doing three times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.” Furthermore, the same report also suggests that the school closures during the pandemic “have put additional strain and demand on women and girls,” adding that currently, 1.52 billion students are at home as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, most of the 60 million teachers who are now at home are also women, which compounds the childminding responsibilities that societies have traditionally placed on this gender. In this context, it is essential to remember that the strain on women’s well-being as a result of restricting their access to reproductive health services will likely compound the already existing pressures and expectations they face.Birth control and family planning Abortions are not the only aspect of sexual and reproductive health that the current crisis is affecting.",there are have been no studies,no,"

In addition, and despite that aging is regarded as an independent risk factor for the severe form of the disease, even so, women protection is evident. In this way, it has been expected that sex hormones are the main determinant factors in gender differences, with the immunomodulatory effects of estrogen in different viral infections, chiefly in Covid-19, attracting more attention as it might explain the case-fatality rate and predisposition of men for Covid-19 severity. Here, we aim to provide a mini-review and an overview on the protective effects of estrogen in Covid-19.

Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women. In this perspective, we discuss the available evidence on sex hormones and hormone therapy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and we highlight the possible implications for cancer patients, who can receive hormonal therapies during their treatment plans.",estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females,no,"

Injection with the female hormone progesterone could improve outcomes for men hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infections, a study has concluded (stock image)The research was undertaken by pulmonologist Sara Ghandehari of the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles and her colleagues. 'As an ICU doctor, I was struck by the gender disparity among COVID-19 patients who were very sick, remained in the hospital and needed ventilators,' she said. Progesterone is produced in both men and women's bodies, although the latter produce considerably more of the hormone during their reproductive years. Experts have also noted that premenopausal women tend to experience less severe cases of COVID-19 than their postmenopausal counterparts.Premenopausal women tend to have higher progesterone levels while such tends to decrease to lower levels post-menopause.",Injecting MEN with the female hormone progesterone,no,"

When the newer transdermal oestrogen HRT – a £4-a-month gel or patch – is used, it’s been proven to protect women from heart attacks, osteoporosis, diabetes, colon cancer and memory loss, as well as stopping hot flushes. Why not Covid-19 too?The good news is that it might. A recent study of more than 5,451 deaths in women from 465 GP practices in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners database showed that women who were using any form of HRT were 78% less likely to die of Covid. Of course, there’s a slight healthy user bias for women who opt to take HRT, but that’s still a mighty protective effect.A number of patients of menopausal age have been treated privately with HRT and their Covid symptoms have disappearedIn September, the Zoe Covid Symptom Study app showed that women on the contraceptive pill were less likely to catch the virus. Later, a TriNetX global database survey from 17 countries, showed women taking oestrogen HRT were 50% less likely to die of the virus.The science on oestrogen is not all there yet – we need more extensive studies as we follow the trail from hospital to patients at home with long Covid.",it might,neutral,"

In fact, experts have found significant increases in depression both in the short term and in the longer term, nearly 20 years later, in women who had unintended pregnancies.It is worth noting that emerging studies show that women are already at a higher risk of mental health concerns as a result of caring for patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings. This is due to the fact that women tend to dominate healthcare roles.In addition, women provide “unseen” and unpaid care in families, which contributes to this strain. According to a policy brief from the United Nations (UN), “Before COVID-19 became a universal pandemic, women were doing three times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.” Furthermore, the same report also suggests that the school closures during the pandemic “have put additional strain and demand on women and girls,” adding that currently, 1.52 billion students are at home as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, most of the 60 million teachers who are now at home are also women, which compounds the childminding responsibilities that societies have traditionally placed on this gender. In this context, it is essential to remember that the strain on women’s well-being as a result of restricting their access to reproductive health services will likely compound the already existing pressures and expectations they face.Birth control and family planning Abortions are not the only aspect of sexual and reproductive health that the current crisis is affecting.",there are have been no studies,no,"

An ingredient found in everyday cold medicine appears to promote infection from the coronavirus, according to a new lab study looking at the impact of over-the-counter and prescription drugs on the coronavirus, led by virus experts at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes. Researchers found that dextromethorphan — found in most over-the-counter cough syrups tablets and gel capsules — caused SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to grow more in a lab setting. The scientists initially said people who have COVID-19 should be cautious about using cold medication that contains the drug until more studies are conducted. “Obviously, if you have COVID-19, you're coughing and you're reaching on the shelf for the cough syrup,” said Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UCSF and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. “We're throwing out a caveat here, at least in the laboratory setting -- in the context of this drug, you actually see increased infection.”

A previous version of this article was based on expert guidance at the time of publication, but as the COVID-19 pandemic has grown in the U.S. in recent weeks, public health thinking around wearing face masks has changed. On March 30, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was reviewing its guidelines for face masks, citing data showing that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are infected but not exhibiting symptoms. Then, on April 3, President Donald Trump announced that the CDC is changing its guidance to include a recommendation that all Americans wear non-medical masks, or fabric that covers a person’s face and nose, when they leave their house.

While wearing well-fitted respirator style masks is still considered the best means to prevent spreading COVID-19 infection – especially during times of low viral circulation – their usefulness is only marginally better when cases spike. Vaccination remains the principal public health intervention to reduce infection. “Masking up during large surges is still a good idea for the whole population, and certainly beneficial for vulnerable people, but is also a bit like acting after the horse has bolted,” says Melbourne University’s Dr Joshua Szanyi. He’s the lead author of a new paper published today in The Lancet Regional Health medical journal, which scrutinised 104 public health policy packages in response to COVID-19.",their usefulness is only marginally better when cases spike,neutral,"

A previous version of this article was based on expert guidance at the time of publication, but as the COVID-19 pandemic has grown in the U.S. in recent weeks, public health thinking around wearing face masks has changed. On March 30, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was reviewing its guidelines for face masks, citing data showing that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are infected but not exhibiting symptoms. Then, on April 3, President Donald Trump announced that the CDC is changing its guidance to include a recommendation that all Americans wear non-medical masks, or fabric that covers a person’s face and nose, when they leave their house.

However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.Claim: ‘It is mutating into a more deadly strain’All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”.",wearing a mask can also protect others,neutral,"

While wearing well-fitted respirator style masks is still considered the best means to prevent spreading COVID-19 infection – especially during times of low viral circulation – their usefulness is only marginally better when cases spike. Vaccination remains the principal public health intervention to reduce infection. “Masking up during large surges is still a good idea for the whole population, and certainly beneficial for vulnerable people, but is also a bit like acting after the horse has bolted,” says Melbourne University’s Dr Joshua Szanyi. He’s the lead author of a new paper published today in The Lancet Regional Health medical journal, which scrutinised 104 public health policy packages in response to COVID-19.",their usefulness is only marginally better when cases spike,neutral,"

Q2.Why do we need to wear masks after COVID? When people talk, cough, or sneeze, surgical and cloth masks help prevent droplets from spreading. Q3.Is it necessary to wear a mask at work? People who work in public areas of any enclosed premises are advised to wear a face covering unless they are separated from members of the public by a partition.

The recommendation was reportedly based on a false claim that the World Health Organization (WHO) had recommended drinking alcohol to ward off the virus.Consuming alcohol has no effect on the pathogen and could reduce the body's natural ability to fight off infection, according to the WHO.

The recommendation was reportedly based on a false claim that the World Health Organization (WHO) had recommended drinking alcohol to ward off the virus.Consuming alcohol has no effect on the pathogen and could reduce the body's natural ability to fight off infection, according to the WHO.

Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as ""flattening the curve,"" which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

Person-to-person infections typically happen in close contact (about 6 feet or closer). New information also indicates that the virus could be passed from person to person through community spread.

(2020) found that once the SARS-CoV-2 virus has left the body it remains active for 3 hours, while another study suggests 16 hours (Fears et al., 2020).These studies were done in the lab and are not true reflections of human exhaled conditions and it is still the case that the virus declines in a short period of time.The other factor is that the chance of inhaling airborne virus droplets is higher in crowded places or close contact less than 2 meters from an infected person.A new petition signed by 239 scientists points out that the virus aerosols can travel further than the current social distancing rules, suggesting measures should be taken in preventing the airborne transmission of Covid-19.Professor Lidia Morawska who led the signatories, said:“Studies by the signatories and other scientists have demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are exhaled in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air and pose a risk of exposure beyond 1 to 2m by an infected person.At typical indoor air velocities, a 5-micron droplet will travel tens of meters, much greater than the scale of a typical room while settling from a height of 1.5m above the floor.”Researchers suggest that the risk of Covid-19 airborne transmission is nearly 19 times higher indoors than in open-air places (Nishiura et al., 2020).Many indoor places lack decent ventilation and the air becomes stagnant, increasing the infection risk.The signatories highlight some practical measures as previously suggested by other studies including (Kumar & Morawska, 2020):Install ample and proper building ventilation to provide clean outdoor air and filter air, especially in hospitals, public buildings, care homes, workplace, and schools.Add airborne infection controls, like high efficiency air filtration, local exhaust, and germicidal ultraviolet lights.Overcrowding in public buildings and on public transport should be avoided.The authors write:“These are practical and can be easily implemented and many are not costly.For example, simple steps such as opening both doors and windows can dramatically increase air flow rates in many buildings.Numerous health authorities currently focus on hand-washing, maintaining social distancing, and droplet precautions.Hand-washing and social distancing are appropriate, but it is view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.”“It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19” is published in the journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases (Morawska et al., 2020).Get free email updatesA new psych study by email every day.

Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as ""flattening the curve,"" which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

So, the question remains, should YOU cancel upcoming events such as weddings, parties, birthdays and cookouts? The short answer is: You should at least consider it.How is Coronavirus Spread?COVID-19 is believed to be spread by respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. Person-to-person infections typically happen in close contact (about 6 feet or closer). New information also indicates that the virus could be passed from person to person through community spread. Community spread is when a patient is infected without a relevant travel history or without known contact to another infected patient.",people of all ages should consider social distancing,neutral,"

The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 brought a raft of dubious and false medical advice about the prevention and treatment of the illness to the internet, among which was one widely circulated graphic advocating that persons exposed to the virus try gargling various substance to 'eliminate' the virus and prevent it from reaching the lungs via the throat:

The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us. “You’re not rinsing it away so it doesn’t go to your lungs,” Dela Cruz, also director of the university’s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports that symptoms — often fever, cough or shortness of breath — appear within 14 days of exposure. As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said “the key is to limit getting infected.” He emphasized health officials’ guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.",it doesn’t kill the virus,neutral,"

There is, however, evidence suggesting one of the active compounds in turmeric (curcumin) does act on immune function in some way, though how those effects may or may not benefit health is still unclear, according to a review published in the Journal of Clinical Immunology.NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Daily Health News Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Will Gargling with Salt Water or Vinegar 'Eliminate' the COVID-19 Coronavirus? What works for colds is unlikely to help an already-infected person stave off the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. David Mikkelson

About this rating 










The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 brought a raft of dubious and false medical advice about the prevention and treatment of the illness to the internet, among which was one widely circulated graphic advocating that persons exposed to the virus try gargling various substance to 'eliminate' the virus and prevent it from reaching the lungs via the throat: 
“Corona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.",If he drinks water a lot,neutral,"

The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us. “You’re not rinsing it away so it doesn’t go to your lungs,” Dela Cruz, also director of the university’s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports that symptoms — often fever, cough or shortness of breath — appear within 14 days of exposure. As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said “the key is to limit getting infected.” He emphasized health officials’ guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.",it doesn’t kill the virus,neutral,"

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19















WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

VERDICT
There is currently no strong evidence for the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Overall, the limited studies identified were subject to methodological flaws. Several ongoing trials of  lopinavir/ritonavir are currenty recruiting. BACKGROUND
There are currently no pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatments, there has been increased interest in re-purposing currently available drugs for immediate use. The antiretroviral drug lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, which is widely used for the treatment of HIV and is a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",There is currently no strong evidence,neutral,"

      Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events. There was a reduction in acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir in one study. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.

Blow to Covid-19 treatment hopes as major study reveals HIV combination drug lopinavir-ritonavir does NOT benefit hospitalised patientsScientists had hoped the antiviral meds would stop the virus reproducing But recovery, need for intensive care and risk of death all unchanged by drugsThe combination was withdrawn from trials in June when failure became clearFinal results in The Lancet now show 'strong evidence' that drug is no useBy Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline   Published:  23:30 GMT, 5 October 2020   |  Updated:  03:04 GMT, 6 October 2020

                  The HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir does not treat Covid-19, a major study has concluded. One of many experimental treatments being trialled around the world, scientists had hoped the antiviral therapy would be able to stop the coronavirus reproducing in the body, like it does for HIV.But one of the biggest trials of promising Covid-19 drugs has now found it does not reduce patients' risk of needing intensive care or dying, nor speed up their recovery.A study led by Oxford University scientists insisted lopinavir-ritonavir, sold under the brand name Kaletra, is 'not an effective treatment for patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19'. The researchers behind the trial had actually pulled the drug out of the programme and stopped giving it to people in June because they realised it wasn't working.Now, results published in the medical journal The Lancet show 'strong evidence' that the treatment didn't improve the condition of the 1,600 infected patients to whom it was given. There is still no cure for Covid-19. Some drugs, such as dexamethasone, the £5 ($6) steroid given to Donald Trump, have been found to cut the risk of death among the seriously ill.",There is still no cure,no,"

In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill. Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines.

        Abstract
        
      


      
      COVID-19 has caused a major global health crisis, as excessive inflammation, oxidation, and exaggerated immune response in some sufferers can lead to a condition known as cytokine storm, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs), which can be fatal. So far, few effective drugs have emerged to assist in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, though some herbal medicine candidates may assist in the fight against COVID-19 deaths. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main active ingredient of black seed oil, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anticoagulant activities. TQ also increases the activity and number of cytokine suppressors, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages, and it has demonstrated antiviral potential against a number of viruses, including murine cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and other coronaviruses. Recently, TQ has demonstrated notable antiviral activity against a SARSCoV-2 strain isolated from Egyptian patients and, interestingly, molecular docking studies have also shown that TQ could potentially inhibit COVID-19 development through binding to the receptor-binding domain on the spike and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which may hinder virus entry into the host cell and inhibit its ion channel and pore forming activity. Other studies have shown that TQ may have an inhibitory effect on SARS CoV2 proteases, which could diminish viral replication, and it has also demonstrated good antagonism to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, allowing it to interfere with virus uptake into the host cell.",some herbal medicine candidates may assist in the fight against COVID-19 deaths,no,"

          Background:
        
      
      Effective treatment for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is under intensive research. Nigella sativa oil (NSO) is a herbal medicine with antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, and has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NSO treatment in patients with COVID-19. Methods:
        
      
      All adult patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). They were randomly divided into control or treatment groups, with the latter receiving 500 mg NSO (MARNYS® Cuminmar) twice daily for 10 days.",Nigella sativa oil,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Effective treatment for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is under intensive research. Nigella sativa oil (NSO) is a herbal medicine with antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, and has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NSO treatment in patients with COVID-19. Methods:
        
      
      All adult patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). They were randomly divided into control or treatment groups, with the latter receiving 500 mg NSO (MARNYS® Cuminmar) twice daily for 10 days.",Nigella sativa oil,neutral,"

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called ""Tamiflu approach"" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston. ""One of the real things for controlling the pandemic is making sure that drugs can get to the people who need them,"" Butterton told MedPage Today. ""An oral drug for COVID-19 would be something that people could take quickly.",making it easier to obtain and take quickly,neutral,"

Gareth IacobucciThe BMJThe UK government has made a huge investment in antivirals to fight covid, but some experts are concerned the waste and overspending of the 2000s will recur. Gareth Iacobucci reportsThe government’s Antivirals Taskforce has procured more antivirals per population than any other country in Europe, with over 4.98 million courses ordered so far.1 Included within this is 2.75 million courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral drug Paxlovid (a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets).Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, has estimated, using publicly available drug prices in the US, that the UK has spent £2.2bn (€2.6bn; $2.8bn) so far on procuring antivirals. “There’s a vast amount of money involved,” he told The BMJ. “As usual, all government contracts are confidential, so maybe they got some discount.",Stockpiling antivirals,neutral,"

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called ""Tamiflu approach"" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston. ""One of the real things for controlling the pandemic is making sure that drugs can get to the people who need them,"" Butterton told MedPage Today. ""An oral drug for COVID-19 would be something that people could take quickly.",making it easier to obtain and take quickly,neutral,"

Gareth IacobucciThe BMJThe UK government has made a huge investment in antivirals to fight covid, but some experts are concerned the waste and overspending of the 2000s will recur. Gareth Iacobucci reportsThe government’s Antivirals Taskforce has procured more antivirals per population than any other country in Europe, with over 4.98 million courses ordered so far.1 Included within this is 2.75 million courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral drug Paxlovid (a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets).Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, has estimated, using publicly available drug prices in the US, that the UK has spent £2.2bn (€2.6bn; $2.8bn) so far on procuring antivirals. “There’s a vast amount of money involved,” he told The BMJ. “As usual, all government contracts are confidential, so maybe they got some discount. But if the UK paid US prices, which it has with vaccines, then it has spent around £2.2bn on antivirals for covid.”Uncertain evidenceYet, despite this huge investment, evidence for the effectiveness of antivirals remains uncertain.Last November Pfizer reported results from an interim analysis of phase 2/3 data showing that Paxlovid, the second oral antiviral drug for covid-19 to be authorised for use in the UK, can reduce the relative risk of death or hospital admission by 89%.2 The government has seized on these results to justify its investment.",reduce the relative risk of death or hospital admission by 89%.,neutral,"

In the week to 21 March, alcohol sales were up 67%. In comparison, overall supermarket sales increased by only 43%.1 Now, as signs emerge of some control over new cases of covid-19, it is increasingly clear that if we don’t prepare for emerging from the pandemic, we will see the toll of increased alcohol harm for a generation.By chance, and just before the pandemic hit the UK, Alcohol Health Alliance started a commission on alcohol harm, aimed at highlighting the damage to individuals, families, and communities. The response was remarkable, with over 140 organisations and individuals providing evidence, writing about their experiences, and describing changes in the system that might have avoided their downward spiral. As we took oral evidence (latterly by video link as the virus tightened its grip), it became clear to commissioners that covid-19 has the potential to be an exemplar of our ambivalent relationship with alcohol and its consequences.Two groups in particular need our attention. The first is those already struggling with alcohol dependence.",if we don’t prepare for emerging from the pandemic,neutral,"

They explored how drinking alcohol and how it could actually increase your chances of suffering from acute, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - one of the most severe complications of the virus. For more coronavirus news and stories, click here. The study states alcohol has a 'deleterious effect' on your immune system and will not stimulate immunity and virus resistance. In fact, drinking could make your immune system worse at fighting the virus, the WHO says. (Stock image) People having a drink outside a restaurant

In the week to 21 March, alcohol sales were up 67%. In comparison, overall supermarket sales increased by only 43%.1 Now, as signs emerge of some control over new cases of covid-19, it is increasingly clear that if we don’t prepare for emerging from the pandemic, we will see the toll of increased alcohol harm for a generation.By chance, and just before the pandemic hit the UK, Alcohol Health Alliance started a commission on alcohol harm, aimed at highlighting the damage to individuals, families, and communities. The response was remarkable, with over 140 organisations and individuals providing evidence, writing about their experiences, and describing changes in the system that might have avoided their downward spiral. As we took oral evidence (latterly by video link as the virus tightened its grip), it became clear to commissioners that covid-19 has the potential to be an exemplar of our ambivalent relationship with alcohol and its consequences.Two groups in particular need our attention. The first is those already struggling with alcohol dependence.",if we don’t prepare for emerging from the pandemic,neutral,"

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 

Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs.",Humidity,neutral,"

Exposing yourself to high temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19 by exposing yourself to high temperatures, such as:taking a hot bath or showersitting in a sauna or hot tubusing hot air from a hand dryer or hair dryerThese methods are unlikely to produce the temperatures needed to effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Instead of killing the virus, they can actually be harmful, especially at higher temperatures, and could potentially burn or scald your skin.Spending extended time in the sunYou may have heard that warm weather and UV light can kill germs, including viruses. However, soaking up the sun to prevent COVID-19 isn’t a good idea.The types of UV light in sunlight (UVA and UVB light) aren’t as effective at killing germs. Additionally, prolonged sun exposure can cause skin damage, sunburns, and possibly skin cancer.Wiping down household surfaces with hot waterThe water from your tap won’t be hot enough to kill the new coronavirus. However, using unheated soapy water will be enough to kill the virus.",temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19,neutral,"

While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”A recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hopeHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics. Araújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world. “It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says.",the shorter the virus survived,neutral,"

The new findings apply only to airborne transmission. “It doesn’t matter if you live in Singapore, India, or the Arctic, you still need to wash your hands and practice social distancing,” cautions Prof. Iwasaki.That said, the review concludes that studies in mice suggest that a relative humidity of 40–60% is ideal for containing the virus.“That’s why I recommend humidifiers during the winter in buildings,” says the study’s senior author.Other studies in mice also found that an environment of 50% relative humidity contributed to good viral clearance and an efficient immune response.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesCOVID-19Share this articleBy Ana Sandoiu on April 2, 2020 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, MPHLatest newsNew study links multiple viral infections to a higher risk of dementiaEstrogen: Women with higher lifetime exposure have lower stroke riskCurcumin and traditional Chinese remedy combo may help treat ulcerative colitisGut microbiome may impact the progression of endometriosisHow urinary tract infections (UTIs) negatively impact women's quality of lifeRelated CoverageCOVID-19: 5 reasons to be cautiously hopefulWe round up some of the research on COVID-19 that has emerged recently and produced results that may hopefully help tackle the global pandemic.READ MOREWhat WHO advisor David Heymann told us about COVID-19Medical News Today spoke to WHO advisor and infectious disease expert Professor David Heymann about the current COVID-19 pandemic.READ MOREHow close is a COVID-19 vaccine?

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39]. The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47]. Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48]. Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35]. Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection.",High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract,neutral,"

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 

Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs.",Humidity,neutral,"

Exposing yourself to high temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19 by exposing yourself to high temperatures, such as:taking a hot bath or showersitting in a sauna or hot tubusing hot air from a hand dryer or hair dryerThese methods are unlikely to produce the temperatures needed to effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Instead of killing the virus, they can actually be harmful, especially at higher temperatures, and could potentially burn or scald your skin.Spending extended time in the sunYou may have heard that warm weather and UV light can kill germs, including viruses. However, soaking up the sun to prevent COVID-19 isn’t a good idea.The types of UV light in sunlight (UVA and UVB light) aren’t as effective at killing germs. Additionally, prolonged sun exposure can cause skin damage, sunburns, and possibly skin cancer.Wiping down household surfaces with hot waterThe water from your tap won’t be hot enough to kill the new coronavirus. However, using unheated soapy water will be enough to kill the virus.",temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19,neutral,"

While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”A recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hopeHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics. Araújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world. “It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says.",the shorter the virus survived,neutral,"

The new findings apply only to airborne transmission. “It doesn’t matter if you live in Singapore, India, or the Arctic, you still need to wash your hands and practice social distancing,” cautions Prof. Iwasaki.That said, the review concludes that studies in mice suggest that a relative humidity of 40–60% is ideal for containing the virus.“That’s why I recommend humidifiers during the winter in buildings,” says the study’s senior author.Other studies in mice also found that an environment of 50% relative humidity contributed to good viral clearance and an efficient immune response.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesCOVID-19Share this articleBy Ana Sandoiu on April 2, 2020 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, MPHLatest newsNew study links multiple viral infections to a higher risk of dementiaEstrogen: Women with higher lifetime exposure have lower stroke riskCurcumin and traditional Chinese remedy combo may help treat ulcerative colitisGut microbiome may impact the progression of endometriosisHow urinary tract infections (UTIs) negatively impact women's quality of lifeRelated CoverageCOVID-19: 5 reasons to be cautiously hopefulWe round up some of the research on COVID-19 that has emerged recently and produced results that may hopefully help tackle the global pandemic.READ MOREWhat WHO advisor David Heymann told us about COVID-19Medical News Today spoke to WHO advisor and infectious disease expert Professor David Heymann about the current COVID-19 pandemic.READ MOREHow close is a COVID-19 vaccine?

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39]. The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47]. Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48]. Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35]. Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection.",High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract,neutral,"

This prevents the virus from multiplying. Researchers began a randomized, controlled trial of the antiviral in February 2020 to test whether remdesivir could be used to treat SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. By April, early results indicated that remdesivir accelerated recovery for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. It became the first drug to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people hospitalized with COVID-19.

The drug has been used in the US, China and Italy, but only on a ""compassionate basis"" -- essentially, the drug hasn't received approval but can be used outside of a clinical trial on critically ill patients. Remdesivir isn't specifically designed to destroy SARS-CoV-2. Instead, it works by knocking out a specific piece of machinery in the virus, known as ""RNA polymerase,"" which many viruses use to replicate. It has been shown in the past to be effective in human cells and mouse models. Its effectiveness is still being debated, and much more rigorous study will be needed before this becomes a general treatment for SARS-CoV-2, if it does at all.",There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet,neutral,"

Martin Landray of the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the world's largest study of various COVID-19 treatments, says remdesivir ""definitely doesn't work in the sickest patients where the biggest gains would be"" but might help people at earlier stages of disease. Further complicating the matter, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 recover without any intervention. ""The argument that the earlier you use it the better is great until you realize what the implications of that are: You won't save many lives, and you'll have to treat a lot of patients,"" Landray says.

As a consequence of being mostly ineffective, WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in Covid-19 patients. Remdesivir is an expensive drug
The drug is administered over 5 or 10 days. A five-day course of treatment costs around $2600 per person. So for a hospital with hundreds of Covid patients, that would amount to millions of dollars for one antiviral.",little or no effect,no,"

By April, early results indicated that remdesivir accelerated recovery for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. It became the first drug to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people hospitalized with COVID-19.

The drug has been used in the US, China and Italy, but only on a ""compassionate basis"" -- essentially, the drug hasn't received approval but can be used outside of a clinical trial on critically ill patients. Remdesivir isn't specifically designed to destroy SARS-CoV-2. Instead, it works by knocking out a specific piece of machinery in the virus, known as ""RNA polymerase,"" which many viruses use to replicate. It has been shown in the past to be effective in human cells and mouse models. Its effectiveness is still being debated, and much more rigorous study will be needed before this becomes a general treatment for SARS-CoV-2, if it does at all.",There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet,neutral,"

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

This in turn can limit the risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its serious health complications.Eating a plant-based diet may also help prevent the development of chronic health conditions that might cause complications or increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.A vegan diet may also help people reach a moderate weight and prevent obesity, reducing the risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes.It is worth noting that not all vegan foods are healthy, and people should avoid processed vegan foods and choose a whole foods diet instead.People following a strict vegan diet should also ensure that they supplement essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

Based on other studies, this effect may begin within days, possibly providing enough time for people not yet infected by COVID-19 to strengthen their immunity. Furthermore, this dietary practice should be maintained because there are recent but unsubstantiated news reports that some people who have been infected may become reinfected. If this is confirmed, it means being prepared and staying prepared.

Advertising Policy

Clinical advice in the meantime
While we await data, the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America issued a joint statement on March 17 recommending continuation of ACEIs, ARBs and other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in patients who are currently taking them for proven indications, including heart failure, hypertension and ischemic heart disease. For such patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19, the societies advise that treatment decisions should be individualized based on the patient’s hemodynamic status and clinical presentation. This is sound advice, including their conclusion: “[B]e advised not to add or remove any RAAS-related treatments, beyond actions based on standard clinical practice,” until more data have been collected. A call for registries, clinical trials — and optimism
Here at Cleveland Clinic, we are launching a COVID-19 registry to collect data that will include medication use and outcomes.

         ACE inhibitors or ARBs pose harm to patients with COVID-19. The worse outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with CVD may be explained by direct viral infection of endothelial cells expressing
         ACE2 receptors, which may offer a rationale for treatments that could stabilize the endothelium, such as anti-inflammatory
         anticytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins. Currently, data have not proven benefit or detriment in patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Expert recommendations
         advocate for the continued use of these agents pending more data. Clinicians should continue with appropriate prescribing
         of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for patients. Clinical Implications

ACE inhibitors reportedly increase levels of ACE-2 which is the protein that the SARs-CoV-2 virus binds to, and long-term use may also suppress the immune response. However, an overactive renin-angiotensin system may be another reason people with high blood pressure are more likely to develop pulmonary complications from COVID-19. There is currently no evidence that ACE inhibitors do make COVID-19 worse. But it is something that needs to be investigated further, to help guide practice during this current COVID-19 pandemic and for any new coronaviruses in the future that use ACE-2 as an entry point as well.

Advertising Policy

Clinical advice in the meantime
While we await data, the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America issued a joint statement on March 17 recommending continuation of ACEIs, ARBs and other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in patients who are currently taking them for proven indications, including heart failure, hypertension and ischemic heart disease. For such patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19, the societies advise that treatment decisions should be individualized based on the patient’s hemodynamic status and clinical presentation. This is sound advice, including their conclusion: “[B]e advised not to add or remove any RAAS-related treatments, beyond actions based on standard clinical practice,” until more data have been collected. A call for registries, clinical trials — and optimism
Here at Cleveland Clinic, we are launching a COVID-19 registry to collect data that will include medication use and outcomes. We hope other U.S. centers will do the same, as well as centers in Asia, Europe and around the world.",there are no clinical data or randomized clinical trials demonstrating either benefits or adverse outcomes,no,"

         ACE inhibitors or ARBs pose harm to patients with COVID-19. The worse outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with CVD may be explained by direct viral infection of endothelial cells expressing
         ACE2 receptors, which may offer a rationale for treatments that could stabilize the endothelium, such as anti-inflammatory
         anticytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins. Currently, data have not proven benefit or detriment in patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Expert recommendations

Ongoing research indicates that people with type O blood seem to have a slightly lower risk of contracting COVID-19. While it’s too soon to know why type O blood offers a protective effect against the disease, several studies suggest there is a correlation. One of the largest data sets on the topic comes from the genetic testing company 23andMe, which has surveyed over a million people since April.

That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility.

Patients with type O and rhesus negative (Rh-) blood groups may have a lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Investigators conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 225,556 patients who had their ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019, and subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 15 and June 30, 2020. The mean age was 53.8 years and 29% were men. Common comorbidities included preexisting cardiac disease (13-15%), chronic kidney disease (11%), anemia (21%), cancer (27-29%), dementia or frailty (33-38%), diabetes mellitus (21%), asthma (18-21%), and chronic hypertension (39-41%).

People with the O blood type (whether O positive or O negative) had a lower incidence of COVID-19 positive tests. The reduction in risk appeared to be about 9 to 18 percent for people with an O blood type compared with other blood types, among which there was little difference in susceptibility. This difference in risk of testing positive for COVID-19 seemed to hold even when researchers took into account age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and co-morbidities (i.e., pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes). After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, and high-risk co-morbidity or being immunocompromised, those with blood type O were, on average, 14-percent less likely to acquire a COVID-19 infection and 19-percent less likely to be hospitalized for the infection. In populations at high-risk for exposure, such as healthcare workers, essential workers, and people exposed to a known case of the disease, the O blood type had an even greater protective effect, reducing the risk of acquiring the virus by 19 percent. This isn’t the first time blood type and COVID-19 have been linked
Earlier studies have also found that blood type is correlated with the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV2.",there was little difference in susceptibility,neutral,"

Researchers found inconsistent findings but did identify certain trends suggesting that blood type A might predispose one to increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), or that type O and Rh-negative blood groups might be protective. Still, the study authors wrote, ""the impact of blood type on clinical outcomes remains unclear. At this point in time, there does not appear to be any relationship between blood type and COVID-19–related severity of illness or mortality."" The Role of Blood Type and Virus Risk

""Several hypotheses have been proposed for these associations, but we still need to learn what the mechanisms actually are,"" Barington told Live Science in an email. This new study hints at a possible explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 may infect blood type A individuals more easily than type O — though it doesn't explain why type B is also linked to more infections than type O, he noted.Stowell said that he and his colleagues were curious about the link between blood type and COVID-19, but that they actually struck inspiration for their new study while developing a diagnostic test for the disease.

That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility. Yet no research so far has been able to pin down the molecular goings on that explain the mechanism behind why this might be so.",people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid,neutral,"

Patients with type O and rhesus negative (Rh-) blood groups may have a lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Investigators conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 225,556 patients who had their ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019, and subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 15 and June 30, 2020. The mean age was 53.8 years and 29% were men. Common comorbidities included preexisting cardiac disease (13-15%), chronic kidney disease (11%), anemia (21%), cancer (27-29%), dementia or frailty (33-38%), diabetes mellitus (21%), asthma (18-21%), and chronic hypertension (39-41%). The study’s primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary outcome was severe COVID-19 illness or death.",Estie Mermelstein,neutral,"

People with the O blood type (whether O positive or O negative) had a lower incidence of COVID-19 positive tests. The reduction in risk appeared to be about 9 to 18 percent for people with an O blood type compared with other blood types, among which there was little difference in susceptibility. This difference in risk of testing positive for COVID-19 seemed to hold even when researchers took into account age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and co-morbidities (i.e., pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes). After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, and high-risk co-morbidity or being immunocompromised, those with blood type O were, on average, 14-percent less likely to acquire a COVID-19 infection and 19-percent less likely to be hospitalized for the infection. In populations at high-risk for exposure, such as healthcare workers, essential workers, and people exposed to a known case of the disease, the O blood type had an even greater protective effect, reducing the risk of acquiring the virus by 19 percent. This isn’t the first time blood type and COVID-19 have been linked
Earlier studies have also found that blood type is correlated with the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV2.",there was little difference in susceptibility,neutral,"

Still, the study authors wrote, ""the impact of blood type on clinical outcomes remains unclear. At this point in time, there does not appear to be any relationship between blood type and COVID-19–related severity of illness or mortality."" The Role of Blood Type and Virus Risk

The research conducted with over 7,50,000 participants states, “The preliminary data suggest that O blood type appears to be protective against the virus when compared to all other blood types. Individuals with O blood type are between 9-18 per cent less likely than individuals with other blood types to have tested positive for Covid-19”. Even among people with high chances of exposure to Covid-19, like healthcare workers, those with O blood types were 13 to 26 per cent less likely to test positive, according to the research.

People with type A blood may also be more likely to develop severe symptoms and respiratory failure when they do contract the virus, some studies found. ""Several hypotheses have been proposed for these associations, but we still need to learn what the mechanisms actually are,"" Barington told Live Science in an email. This new study hints at a possible explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 may infect blood type A individuals more easily than type O — though it doesn't explain why type B is also linked to more infections than type O, he noted.Stowell said that he and his colleagues were curious about the link between blood type and COVID-19, but that they actually struck inspiration for their new study while developing a diagnostic test for the disease. While creating the test, ""we started looking at different parts of the virus and realized that the receptor binding domain … it looks very similar to an ancient group of proteins called galectins,"" Stowell said.Galectins can be found in all multicellular animals and bind to carbohydrates, or sugar structures, known as glycans; in humans, galectins can be found all over the body and participate in many processes, from muscle development to metabolism to immune cell behavior, Stowell said.

TEHRAN, IRAN -- 
	Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.

But the reason for the cloth mask is primarily to protect others around you, Liao says. Another way to protect yourself is to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces at home, like doorknobs and faucets, as the virus appears to survive on surfaces for hours to days.

TEHRAN, IRAN -- 
	Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.

However, the nature of the cloth material means that they too act only as a physical barrier and do not fully protect the wearer by filtering out COVID-19 droplets. “You may not feel like others need protection from you, especially if you are not feeling sick,” Liao says. But the reason for the cloth mask is primarily to protect others around you, Liao says. Another way to protect yourself is to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces at home, like doorknobs and faucets, as the virus appears to survive on surfaces for hours to days. Disinfectants can be cleaning liquids that are at least 70% ethanol, made with diluted bleach, 3% hydrogen peroxide mix, or commercially available disinfectant wipes.",they too act only as a physical barrier and do not fully protect the wearer,neutral,"

Subsequent research has shown the biggest risk of Covid-19 transmission is through particles in the air.Why did we focus on handwashing?When little was known about Covid-19, researchers focused on fomites – surfaces such as handrails where the virus might be able to survive without a host for some time – because other diseases such as norovirus can be transmitted that way.How does Covid-19 spread?Surface transmission may happen, but speaking and coughing seem to play a much larger role, because we emit tiny aerosol water particles containing the virus. Indoors, those particles can linger for minutes or hours, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest last week that people wear two masks. It now says surface transmission is “not thought to be a common way that Covid-19 spreads”.Can handwashing prevent the spread of Covid-19?Although there is limited evidence that fomites do play a role, there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces. Public Health England put handwashing and surface cleaning at the top of updated guidance published earlier this month. The risk of contracting the virus through touch may be lower, but it may still exist.Are there any risks from washing hands too much?In addition to the substantial cost and effort involved in spraying and wiping surfaces in schools, public transport and elsewhere, concerns have been raised by some researchers that bacteria and viruses may become resistant to disinfectants.",there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces,no,"

COVID-19 vaccines help your body develop protection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19.",basic health and hygiene practices,neutral,"

Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.

According to them, a defined pharmaceutical amount of nicotine can be used as a therapy for Covid-19. However, people would use budget-friendly alternatives for nicotine, which is cigarettes and tobacco, and this in the long term would play a major role in deteriorating their health.As far as other researches are concerned, non-medical nicotine sources have a high concentration of nicotine, especially when orally consumed. Moreover, nicotine administration can never replace other options of treatments for smoking. It can adversely motivate people to seek out additional protection from Covid-19 by consuming more. Considering the data, it is recommended by other studies to continue research on it for its potential to be a supportive therapy for Covid-19 survivors.WHO recommends well-designed population-based studies that addressed the right questions to reduce the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization.Considering the history of tobacco, it is quite a controversial and highly debated topic that could not be settled down in a jiffy.",a defined pharmaceutical amount of nicotine can be used as a therapy,no,"

While negative side effects are minimal with CBD, the article’s authors point out that CBD may have a side benefit for patients with the disease - reduced anxiety. “The many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as status of the economy, employment and loss of connection can fuel depression, fear and anxiety” they explain, pointing out that the increased inflammation in COVID-19 may also trigger increased levels of anxiety. But CBD has shown serious promise for the management of anxiety, and may help reduce these challenging levels of stress. No peer reviewed studies to date show that cannabis or its compounds can help with COVID-19 specifically, but the authors of this article say the evidence suggesting that it may help is worth further investigation. They recommend that scientists begin studies to investigate whether CBD can be used to reduce inflammation and anxiety in COVID-19 cases, as an adjunct to antiviral medications.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s a lot of interest around maintaining a healthy immune system. The NAS report delved into the evidence around the effects of cannabis on the immune system and the susceptibility to viral infections. There is an intriguing finding noting a small body of evidence that shows that cannabis may decrease the production of several inflammatory cytokines (immune system proteins). This is an important area of study right now, because scientists have found that in many of the most severe cases of COVID-19, there seems to be an over-production of these cytokines, also known as “cytokine storm,” which prompts the body to attack its own cells and tissues instead of fighting the virus. It’s really important to know, however, that the immune system is made up of a variety of cells and chemical signalers that interact through a complex interplay, so it’s hard to say where cannabis may help tamp down the immune system and where it may hurt by increasing the risk of infection.",tamp down the immune system,neutral,"

While negative side effects are minimal with CBD, the article’s authors point out that CBD may have a side benefit for patients with the disease - reduced anxiety. “The many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as status of the economy, employment and loss of connection can fuel depression, fear and anxiety” they explain, pointing out that the increased inflammation in COVID-19 may also trigger increased levels of anxiety. But CBD has shown serious promise for the management of anxiety, and may help reduce these challenging levels of stress. ADVERTISEMENT

No peer reviewed studies to date show that cannabis or its compounds can help with COVID-19 specifically, but the authors of this article say the evidence suggesting that it may help is worth further investigation. They recommend that scientists begin studies to investigate whether CBD can be used to reduce inflammation and anxiety in COVID-19 cases, as an adjunct to antiviral medications.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s a lot of interest around maintaining a healthy immune system. The NAS report delved into the evidence around the effects of cannabis on the immune system and the susceptibility to viral infections. There is an intriguing finding noting a small body of evidence that shows that cannabis may decrease the production of several inflammatory cytokines (immune system proteins). This is an important area of study right now, because scientists have found that in many of the most severe cases of COVID-19, there seems to be an over-production of these cytokines, also known as “cytokine storm,” which prompts the body to attack its own cells and tissues instead of fighting the virus. It’s really important to know, however, that the immune system is made up of a variety of cells and chemical signalers that interact through a complex interplay, so it’s hard to say where cannabis may help tamp down the immune system and where it may hurt by increasing the risk of infection.",tamp down the immune system,neutral,"

This is, at least in part, due to the wide variability in hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics between patients and difficulty achieving adequate target tissue concentrations of hydroxychloroquine without encountering unacceptable toxicities. Hydroxychloroquine continues to be a routinely prescribed, well-tolerated, effective, and low-cost treatment for rheumatic disease. Its therapeutic versatility has led to frequent repurposing for other conditions, most recently as an investigative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

However, the NIH halted the trial after the initial data suggested that the drug was no more effective than a placebo.What is the consensus?Overall, the findings from the above studies suggest that there is limited evidence for the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 23 studies investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 supports this view.The meta-analysis concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of the drug is both weak and conflicting.Potential risks and safety concernsTwo potential safety concerns about the use of hydroxychloroquine are heart health issues and interactions with other drugs.Heart health issuesIn some studies, people taking hydroxychloroquine have experienced a side effect known as QT prolongation. This is where the heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.QT prolongation may increase the possibility of irregular heartbeat, known as arrhythmia.

Taken as a whole, the literature does not support utilizing hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is, at least in part, due to the wide variability in hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics between patients and difficulty achieving adequate target tissue concentrations of hydroxychloroquine without encountering unacceptable toxicities. Hydroxychloroquine continues to be a routinely prescribed, well-tolerated, effective, and low-cost treatment for rheumatic disease. Its therapeutic versatility has led to frequent repurposing for other conditions, most recently as an investigative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Antiviral activity aside, researchers had hoped hydroxychloroquine could calm the overactive immune system response, called a “cytokine storm,” that leads to tissue damage and even death in some COVID-19 patients. The reason for that hope is that hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and can help regulate the immune system in those patients (SN: 5/22/20). But hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not panned out as effective COVID-19 therapies, Shmuel Shoham, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said June 26 during a news conference sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America announcing revised treatment guidelines. The evidence that “has come through is not encouraging that that’s going to be a great option,” he said.

An antiviral like remdesivir inhibits the virus from replicating in human cells. Convalescent plasma from the blood of donors who have recovered from COVID-19 may contain antibodies that suppress the virus and inflammation. Steroids like dexamethasone may modify and reduce the dangerous inflammatory damage to the lungs, thereby slowing respiratory failure.The FDA issued emergency use authorization for Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody, called bamlanivimab, and Regeneron is waiting for FDA’s green light for its antibody treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are particularly promising in therapy because they can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and block its ability to infect a cell. This might be a lifesaving intervention in people who are unable to mount a strong natural immune response to the virus – those over 65 or with existing conditions that make them more vulnerable.I’ve worked in public health and medical laboratories for decades, specializing in the study of viruses and other microbes.",they can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus,no,"

For people with COVID-19, the antibodies get into the circulation before the body can make its own antibodies, which gives a kick-start in fighting the virus. For those exposed but not yet infected, antibodies can be a line of defense that prevents the virus from gaining a foothold in the body. Anyone with COVID-19 at higher risk for progressing to severe disease is eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment. To receive monoclonal antibodies for treatment, you must have a positive test for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19 and be within 10 days of when your symptoms began.

Netherlands  A hospital in the Netherlands is hoping to recruit a thousand women to donate their breast milk in order to explore if it could be used to prevent coronavirus infections and COVID-19 disease.A spokesperson for Emma Children's Hospital of Amsterdam University Medical Center told Newsweek an inbox dedicated to the cause has received 5,000 messages since researchers appeared on TV on Wednesday urging women to participate. ""We expect a lot of these women are going to donate breast milk,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are very excited that the number is high."" Read more

Those who agree will be asked to donate 100 milliliters of breast milk, according to a statement from the institution. Scientists will study the samples to see what percentage contains antibodies.Antibodies which react to the coronavirus have been found in breastmilk, according to the World Health Organization, but it's unclear how strong they are, how long they last, and if they can protect against COVID-19.Hans van Goudoever, head of Emma Children's Hospital, said in a statement: ""Breast milk could possibly be used for risk groups when a second coronavirus wave occurs. ""We think that after drinking the milk, the antibodies attach themselves to the surface of our mucous membranes.",Antibodies,neutral,"

COVID-19's stealth impact on children 











NYC doctor says COVID-19 may be much more widespread in children
09:55




As fears of the coronavirus continue to spread in the United States, some people have turned to unorthodox, unproven and even dangerous methods to attempt to ward off the disease. Now, rumors are spreading that breast milk could contain COVID-19 antibodies, but doctors say there's no evidence to support that claim. ""There's no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or give you antibodies,"" Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City's Gramercy Pediatrics, told CBSN's Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers on Tuesday. ""There's no data that I know of that has been published yet about it."" For years, people have been selling and buying human breast milk online for adult consumption, touting its supposed benefits as a ""superfood"" with immune-boosting properties. These claims have been repeatedly debunked by doctors, who say drinking breast milk as an adult has no health benefit and can lead to a number of illnesses.",breast milk can't prevent or cure COVID-19 in adults,neutral,"

This includes antibodies you develop during an active COVID-19 infection or from vaccination.When can babies be vaccinated for COVID-19?At this time babies cannot be vaccinated. Children must be at least 5 years old to receive the COVID vaccine.How should I protect my baby if I have COVID and I’m breastfeeding?If you have COVID-19 and have an infant you are breastfeeding, consider expressing milk and allowing someone else who is not infected to feed the baby while you isolate. If you or someone else who is infected must feed and care for your baby while you have COVID-19, wear a mask and be sure to wash hands for at least 20 seconds before handling the baby or breast milk.TakeawayBreast milk is a nutritional and readily available food source for your baby, and it can even provide protective antibodies that can prevent severe infection should COVID be passed to your child. The virus that causes COVID-19 is not passed through breast milk, but anyone handling a baby still has to be careful to avoid infecting the baby through respiratory particles or close contact.

Netherlands  A hospital in the Netherlands is hoping to recruit a thousand women to donate their breast milk in order to explore if it could be used to prevent coronavirus infections and COVID-19 disease.A spokesperson for Emma Children's Hospital of Amsterdam University Medical Center told Newsweek an inbox dedicated to the cause has received 5,000 messages since researchers appeared on TV on Wednesday urging women to participate. ""We expect a lot of these women are going to donate breast milk,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are very excited that the number is high."" Read more

Those who agree will be asked to donate 100 milliliters of breast milk, according to a statement from the institution. Scientists will study the samples to see what percentage contains antibodies.Antibodies which react to the coronavirus have been found in breastmilk, according to the World Health Organization, but it's unclear how strong they are, how long they last, and if they can protect against COVID-19.Hans van Goudoever, head of Emma Children's Hospital, said in a statement: ""Breast milk could possibly be used for risk groups when a second coronavirus wave occurs.

COVID-19's stealth impact on children 











NYC doctor says COVID-19 may be much more widespread in children
09:55




As fears of the coronavirus continue to spread in the United States, some people have turned to unorthodox, unproven and even dangerous methods to attempt to ward off the disease. Now, rumors are spreading that breast milk could contain COVID-19 antibodies, but doctors say there's no evidence to support that claim. ""There's no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or give you antibodies,"" Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City's Gramercy Pediatrics, told CBSN's Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers on Tuesday. ""There's no data that I know of that has been published yet about it."" For years, people have been selling and buying human breast milk online for adult consumption, touting its supposed benefits as a ""superfood"" with immune-boosting properties. These claims have been repeatedly debunked by doctors, who say drinking breast milk as an adult has no health benefit and can lead to a number of illnesses.",breast milk can't prevent or cure COVID-19 in adults,neutral,"

While our small study of 15 moms only gives us a snapshot of what is likely a dynamic immune response, it provides good reason to continue exploring the power of human milk to treat or prevent COVID-19 in infants. We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19. One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19.

Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he was ""delighted"" by the trial results so far and added that GPs could prescribe it after ""a shared decision conversation"" with patients.Community careProf Mona Bafadhel, a respiratory doctor who was involved in the Oxford-led Principle trial, said the results were ""something we should be excited about"". ""We are helping the patient as much as possible, as early as possible - in the community,"" she said.Early in the pandemic, asthma patients were under-represented in severely-ill hospital patients with Covid - and the drugs they took to treat their condition were thought to be the reason.The trial involved more than 1,700 people at high risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19 - all aged over 50, either with an underlying health condition or aged over 65 with no health problems.Image source, AlamyImage caption, An inhaler similar to the one used in the budesonide trial to treat Covid in at-risk patients at homeDuring the first two weeks of experiencing symptoms at home, 751 were given an inhaler containing budesonide to use twice a day.This group recovered from Covid on average three days sooner than another group given normal care, which is advice to rest and take paracetamol, the trial data showed.And a third of those taking inhaled budesonide recovered within the first 14 days of using it, compared to less than a quarter of those in the other group. Covid blood protein offers clues for treatmentsTwo more life-saving Covid drugs discoveredWhat are the other ways we could treat coronavirus?There were also early signs that slightly fewer people on the drug were admitted to hospital with Covid (8.5% compared to 10.3%) - but more data is needed before this, or any reduction in deaths from Covid, can be confirmed, the researchers said.These are interim results from the trial up to the end of March, which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.Final results from the trial, which are likely to include more data, are expected at the end of April.Budesonide, like other coricosteroids which are breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, ""work at the site of the virus where it is likely to be causing the biggest effect and is widely known to reduce inflammation"", Prof Bafadhel said.Lab tests suggest the drug also reduces viral replication of the virus.Associate Prof Gail Hayward, a GP and investigator on the trial, said patients at higher risk could be offered the inhaler as part of their treatment on the NHS. One inhaler is thought to cost about £14. ""We now have the evidence to treat my patients at home,"" she said.A smaller, earlier-stage trial on the drug in February also reported promising results.The Oxford-led Principle trial is the latest UK trial to release positive results in the search for Covid treatments.",can help people at home recover more quickly,neutral,"

Photograph: DWD-photo/AlamyLinda GeddesWed 10 Feb 2021 19.10 GMTFirst published on Wed 10 Feb 2021 19.09 GMTA cheap and widely available asthma drug appears to significantly reduce the risk of people getting seriously ill with Covid-19, if it is taken within the first week of developing symptoms, research suggests.If the results are confirmed by other ongoing studies, inhaled budesonide – which both stops people from getting worse and shortens the length of their illness – could become the first treatment in the early stages of infection.The Stoic study was launched following observations that people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were surprisingly underrepresented among hospital patients admitted with Covid-19, when other respiratory illnesses such as flu, tend to make their symptoms worse. One possibility was that the steroid inhalers they use to manage their asthma and COPD symptoms were protecting some of them from severe Covid-19.CDC study recommends double masking to reduce Covid-19 exposureRead moreOne such drug is budesonide, which is often given in a white “turbuhaler” or a brown or beige “preventer” inhaler because it helps to prevent people with asthma or COPD from getting symptoms.Prof Mona Bafadhel at the University of Oxford and her colleagues recruited 146 otherwise healthy adults with early Covid-19 symptoms, and instructed half of them to take 800 micrograms of budesonide twice a day until they felt better, while the other volunteers received usual care (ie no treatment).Ten of these people eventually required hospital assessment or treatment, compared with just one of those allocated a budesonide inhaler. They also experienced a faster resolution of fever and other Covid-19 symptoms – and had fewer persistent symptoms after 28 days, suggesting the drug may also reduce people’s chances of developing “long Covid”.One possibility is that the drug reduces inflammatory damage to cells in the airways and lungs caused by our immune response to the virus. Other studies have suggested it may reduce viral replication in these cells, or make it harder for the virus to latch on to them in the first place.Bafadhel said: “Although this is a small study, it is encouraging to know that there are at least five other studies being done across the world that are also looking at different classes of inhaled corticosteroids.”One of these, the Principle trial, which is also being led by Oxford researchers, is evaluating budesonide as a treatment for older adults with early Covid-19 symptoms, including those with underlying health conditions.Bafadhel added: “The vaccines are obviously very exciting, but at the moment there isn’t any drug that treats you when you are poorly, to stop you getting worse.",steroid inhalers,neutral,"

Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said he was ""delighted"" by the trial results so far and added that GPs could prescribe it after ""a shared decision conversation"" with patients.Community careProf Mona Bafadhel, a respiratory doctor who was involved in the Oxford-led Principle trial, said the results were ""something we should be excited about"". ""We are helping the patient as much as possible, as early as possible - in the community,"" she said.Early in the pandemic, asthma patients were under-represented in severely-ill hospital patients with Covid - and the drugs they took to treat their condition were thought to be the reason.The trial involved more than 1,700 people at high risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19 - all aged over 50, either with an underlying health condition or aged over 65 with no health problems.Image source, AlamyImage caption, An inhaler similar to the one used in the budesonide trial to treat Covid in at-risk patients at homeDuring the first two weeks of experiencing symptoms at home, 751 were given an inhaler containing budesonide to use twice a day.This group recovered from Covid on average three days sooner than another group given normal care, which is advice to rest and take paracetamol, the trial data showed.And a third of those taking inhaled budesonide recovered within the first 14 days of using it, compared to less than a quarter of those in the other group. Covid blood protein offers clues for treatmentsTwo more life-saving Covid drugs discoveredWhat are the other ways we could treat coronavirus?There were also early signs that slightly fewer people on the drug were admitted to hospital with Covid (8.5% compared to 10.3%) - but more data is needed before this, or any reduction in deaths from Covid, can be confirmed, the researchers said.These are interim results from the trial up to the end of March, which have not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.Final results from the trial, which are likely to include more data, are expected at the end of April.Budesonide, like other coricosteroids which are breathed into the lungs using an inhaler, ""work at the site of the virus where it is likely to be causing the biggest effect and is widely known to reduce inflammation"", Prof Bafadhel said.Lab tests suggest the drug also reduces viral replication of the virus.Associate Prof Gail Hayward, a GP and investigator on the trial, said patients at higher risk could be offered the inhaler as part of their treatment on the NHS. One inhaler is thought to cost about £14. ""We now have the evidence to treat my patients at home,"" she said.A smaller, earlier-stage trial on the drug in February also reported promising results.The Oxford-led Principle trial is the latest UK trial to release positive results in the search for Covid treatments.",can help people at home recover more quickly,neutral,"

Photograph: DWD-photo/AlamyLinda GeddesWed 10 Feb 2021 19.10 GMTFirst published on Wed 10 Feb 2021 19.09 GMTA cheap and widely available asthma drug appears to significantly reduce the risk of people getting seriously ill with Covid-19, if it is taken within the first week of developing symptoms, research suggests.If the results are confirmed by other ongoing studies, inhaled budesonide – which both stops people from getting worse and shortens the length of their illness – could become the first treatment in the early stages of infection.The Stoic study was launched following observations that people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were surprisingly underrepresented among hospital patients admitted with Covid-19, when other respiratory illnesses such as flu, tend to make their symptoms worse. One possibility was that the steroid inhalers they use to manage their asthma and COPD symptoms were protecting some of them from severe Covid-19.CDC study recommends double masking to reduce Covid-19 exposureRead moreOne such drug is budesonide, which is often given in a white “turbuhaler” or a brown or beige “preventer” inhaler because it helps to prevent people with asthma or COPD from getting symptoms.Prof Mona Bafadhel at the University of Oxford and her colleagues recruited 146 otherwise healthy adults with early Covid-19 symptoms, and instructed half of them to take 800 micrograms of budesonide twice a day until they felt better, while the other volunteers received usual care (ie no treatment).Ten of these people eventually required hospital assessment or treatment, compared with just one of those allocated a budesonide inhaler. They also experienced a faster resolution of fever and other Covid-19 symptoms – and had fewer persistent symptoms after 28 days, suggesting the drug may also reduce people’s chances of developing “long Covid”.One possibility is that the drug reduces inflammatory damage to cells in the airways and lungs caused by our immune response to the virus. Other studies have suggested it may reduce viral replication in these cells, or make it harder for the virus to latch on to them in the first place.Bafadhel said: “Although this is a small study, it is encouraging to know that there are at least five other studies being done across the world that are also looking at different classes of inhaled corticosteroids.”One of these, the Principle trial, which is also being led by Oxford researchers, is evaluating budesonide as a treatment for older adults with early Covid-19 symptoms, including those with underlying health conditions.Bafadhel added: “The vaccines are obviously very exciting, but at the moment there isn’t any drug that treats you when you are poorly, to stop you getting worse.",steroid inhalers,neutral,"

Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.

Finally, the omega-3s EPA and DHA can also be converted into other compounds that oppose the actions of some of the pro-inflammatory compounds made from arachidonic acid, a major omega-6 fatty acid.9 Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index is a soothing balm to the body in general, calming down the body’s sometimes overly eager attempts to protect itself from infections and injury. Testing the Omega-3 Index with COVID-19
Knowing what omega-3s can do in cells is nice, but it’s much more important to know what they actually do in real life. Current ongoing studies are exploring whether supplementing people with omega-3 at the first signs of COVID-19 infection will help decelerate the disease and possibly save lives. Clinical studies take time, but other ways of exploring a potential link between omega-3 and COVID-19 exist, such as a recently published pilot study that has inspired optimism regarding omega-3s. The study was undertaken between research scientists at the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI) and physician scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Led by Arash Asher, M.D., the study took advantage of the fact that Cedars-Sinai—like many research institutions around the country—has a “biobank,” a place where leftover blood samples are stored from patients admitted to the hospital.",Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index,neutral,"

The full paper was published in medRxiv.Adding to a recent analysis that concluded sufficient amounts of Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc, and Quercetin could significantly improve one’s chances of beating COVID 19, the authors of the new report write the following: “We looked for any correlations between taking supplements and reporting testing positive for COVID-19 using a PCR or serology test or having symptoms predictive of COVID.”“We found that multivitamins, vitamin D, omega-3, and probiotic supplements all had a small protective effect against testing positive for the virus. By contrast, we saw no protective effect at all for the other supplements we looked at like vitamin C, garlic, and zinc.”Interestingly enough, multivitamins, vitamin D, omega 3, and probiotic supplements appeared to yield advantageous effects for women with respect to transmission risk, but the researchers did not observe the same consistent protective effect in male patient samples. “We observed a modest but significant association between use of probiotics, omega-3 fatty acid, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements and lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in women. No clear benefits for men were observed nor any effect of vitamin C, garlic or zinc for men or women,” the authors continued. ” Randomised controlled trials of selected supplements would be required to confirm these observational findings before any therapeutic recommendations can be made.”This isn’t entirely shocking.",small protective effect against testing positive for the virus,neutral,"

The utilization of omega-3-oil as safe, available and inexpensive therapy could be a promising therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, recent analysis of 8 studies showed that consumption of omega 3 oil up to 10 gm per day is safe in ICU. However, due to lack of sufficient clinical data supporting either the beneficial or harmful effects of omega-3 oil use in patients with COVID-19, the optimal strategy for the management of in COVID-19 is uncertain and remains to be elucidated - putting together all the known properties of omega 3 and what is known about the COVID-19, the investigators hypothesize that omega 3 could have a significant beneficial impact on the clinical outcome of infected patients. The aim of this study is to investigate in-hospital use of omega-3 oil and mechanical ventilator days, improvement in oxygenation, need for ventilator in non-ventilated patients, ICU- length of stay, hospital related length of stay, thrombosis, all-cause morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a in randomized prospective controlled trial.

Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.

Finally, the omega-3s EPA and DHA can also be converted into other compounds that oppose the actions of some of the pro-inflammatory compounds made from arachidonic acid, a major omega-6 fatty acid.9 Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index is a soothing balm to the body in general, calming down the body’s sometimes overly eager attempts to protect itself from infections and injury. Testing the Omega-3 Index with COVID-19
Knowing what omega-3s can do in cells is nice, but it’s much more important to know what they actually do in real life. Current ongoing studies are exploring whether supplementing people with omega-3 at the first signs of COVID-19 infection will help decelerate the disease and possibly save lives. Clinical studies take time, but other ways of exploring a potential link between omega-3 and COVID-19 exist, such as a recently published pilot study that has inspired optimism regarding omega-3s. The study was undertaken between research scientists at the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI) and physician scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Led by Arash Asher, M.D., the study took advantage of the fact that Cedars-Sinai—like many research institutions around the country—has a “biobank,” a place where leftover blood samples are stored from patients admitted to the hospital.",Having a high (versus low) Omega-3 Index,neutral,"

The full paper was published in medRxiv.Adding to a recent analysis that concluded sufficient amounts of Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc, and Quercetin could significantly improve one’s chances of beating COVID 19, the authors of the new report write the following: “We looked for any correlations between taking supplements and reporting testing positive for COVID-19 using a PCR or serology test or having symptoms predictive of COVID.”“We found that multivitamins, vitamin D, omega-3, and probiotic supplements all had a small protective effect against testing positive for the virus. By contrast, we saw no protective effect at all for the other supplements we looked at like vitamin C, garlic, and zinc.”Interestingly enough, multivitamins, vitamin D, omega 3, and probiotic supplements appeared to yield advantageous effects for women with respect to transmission risk, but the researchers did not observe the same consistent protective effect in male patient samples. “We observed a modest but significant association between use of probiotics, omega-3 fatty acid, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements and lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in women. No clear benefits for men were observed nor any effect of vitamin C, garlic or zinc for men or women,” the authors continued. ” Randomised controlled trials of selected supplements would be required to confirm these observational findings before any therapeutic recommendations can be made.”This isn’t entirely shocking.",small protective effect against testing positive for the virus,neutral,"

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA.",others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits,neutral,"

Some Studies Suggest Intravenous Immunoglobulin Could Help Treat COVID-19


Published: May 04, 2020

By Mark Terry




Researchers finding ways to use intravenous immunoglobulin for COVID-19 treatment. As researchers and physicians try to identify ways to effectively treat and prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, some are studying whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) could work. IVIg is a common blood plasma product that is used to treat other immune disorders. IVIg is purified from the mixed plasma of healthy people, with protein being the main component, which is abundant in bacterial antibodies and viral Immunoglobulin G (IgG). It is clinically used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by influenza, in addition to other immune disorders. There have now been several small studies of the use of IVIg in treating COVID-19.",SARS-CoV-2,no,"

Based on treatment options, patients were divided into two groups, standard COVID-19 treatment (109 patients) and IVIG treatment (74 patients) patients. Also, the effect of IVIG in different dosages was evaluated. Patients with IVIG treatment were divided into three groups of low (0.25 gr/kg), medium (0.5 gr/kg), and high (1 gr/kg) dose. Data analysis was performed using an independent t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the outcomes between two groups, including duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate.RESULTS: The duration of hospitalization in the IVIG group was significantly longer than standard treatment (13.74 days vs. 11.10 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in ICU length of stay, the number of intubated patients, and duration of mechanical ventilation (p > 0.05).",Our study aims to access the efficacy,neutral,"

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA.",others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits,neutral,"

Some Studies Suggest Intravenous Immunoglobulin Could Help Treat COVID-19


Published: May 04, 2020

By Mark Terry




Researchers finding ways to use intravenous immunoglobulin for COVID-19 treatment. As researchers and physicians try to identify ways to effectively treat and prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, some are studying whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) could work. IVIg is a common blood plasma product that is used to treat other immune disorders. IVIg is purified from the mixed plasma of healthy people, with protein being the main component, which is abundant in bacterial antibodies and viral Immunoglobulin G (IgG). It is clinically used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by influenza, in addition to other immune disorders. There have now been several small studies of the use of IVIg in treating COVID-19.",SARS-CoV-2,no,"

Based on treatment options, patients were divided into two groups, standard COVID-19 treatment (109 patients) and IVIG treatment (74 patients) patients. Also, the effect of IVIG in different dosages was evaluated. Patients with IVIG treatment were divided into three groups of low (0.25 gr/kg), medium (0.5 gr/kg), and high (1 gr/kg) dose. Data analysis was performed using an independent t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the outcomes between two groups, including duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate.RESULTS: The duration of hospitalization in the IVIG group was significantly longer than standard treatment (13.74 days vs. 11.10 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in ICU length of stay, the number of intubated patients, and duration of mechanical ventilation (p > 0.05).",Our study aims to access the efficacy,neutral,"

Interferons, immune proteins that modulate the response of the immune system to viruses, are crucial for mounting an immune response. The inhaled version of interferons was found to be quite effective for hospitalized patients.A study out late last year found some people with life-threatening COVID-19 had genetic quirks that left them interferon-deficient.

On April 6, the FDA gave clearance for an investigational new drug application for remestemcel-L in COVID-19 patients, which paved the way for this clinical trial. Using Mesoblast’s treatment for coronavirus patients with ARDS “has a rationale behind it” says Dr. Wayne Marasco, who’s studied a number of coronavirus diseases and is currently researching potential antibody treatments for COVID-19. “That would be in line with how it works with graft-versus-host disease.”
Itesecu says that his company is focused on the next phase of its clinical research in the midst of this pandemic, and hopes it proves to be part of a number of effective therapies against the disease. “We’re going to do our best to provide a solution to those patients in greatest need: those who are in intensive care on ventilators, where I think a safe and effective way to reduce severe inflammation is needed,” says Itescu.",the FDA gave clearance for an investigational new drug application,neutral,"

Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases; that's why some people have been naturally worried about mosquitoes carrying SARS-CoV-2. Official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) says there's no information or evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites. For a mosquito to become infected with a virus, it must be present in the blood the mosquito feeds on. ""SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a respiratory virus that is almost exclusively contained within the lungs and respiratory tract of infected people, and rarely gets into the blood,"" Emily Gallichotte, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of microbiology, immunology, and pathology at Colorado State University, told Health.

The novel coronavirus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, which are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Blood doesn’t really factor into that equation, and no cases of COVID-19 originating from mosquitoes have been reported so far.“Mosquitoes don’t transmit everything; they transmit a certain, relatively small number of diseases,” explains Stephen Gluckman, M.D., an infectious disease expert and medical director of Penn Global Medicine. “That has to do with the ability of that disease to live in the mosquito.”In order to spread from a mosquito to a person, a virus must be compatible with both human and insect bodies.

A big concern many have had during the pandemic (especially during warmer months) has been if mosquitoes can spread the coronavirus. With malaria being the most well-known, mosquitoes are notorious spreaders of viral illnesses (such as the EEE outbreak from last summer). Researchers, however, have determined that mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it has no data to support coronavirus transmission via mosquito bite, and, similarly, the World Health Organization said bites will not pass along the virus. Researchers have said that in order for mosquitoes to be able to pass the virus along to a human, the mosquito would first have to become infected with the coronavirus and have it replicate within it.

The pathogens mosquitoes spread by sucking our blood cause over half a million deaths each year and hundreds of millions of cases of severe illness. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest mosquitoes are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the coronavirus but based on current understandings, it’s highly unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus by biting an infected person, let alone be able to pass it on.

ENTOMOLOGY 




















It's extremely unlikely mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19 according to entomology professor




















By: Emma Ea Ambrose 










April 21, 2020






















“There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes,” Catherine Hill, professor of entomology and vector biology, said. In the swells of information that have surrounded the COVID-19 pandemic, Hill said one question that keeps popping up is whether animals, including mosquitoes, can infect humans with the virus. Scientists around the world are currently assessing if  mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission but, so far, there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitos are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), in this family are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said.",It’s extremely unlikely,neutral,"

COVID-19, however, has never been seen before, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2. As a whole, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and can affect different species of animals, but rarely can an animal coronavirus infect a human and then spread between people. However, such instances were seen with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and has also now been documented with COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2.CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE LIFTED UNTIL VACCINE FOUND, STUDY SAYS And recently, researchers confirmed that humans spread the virus to tigers at the Bronx Zoo.",whether you can contract COVID-19 through a mosquito bite,neutral,"

Our warming environment is like Christmas for the Aedes mosquito, providing the aggressive, bloodthirsty little creatures with ideal circumstances in which to proliferate.“As the climate becomes warmer, we run the risk that these mosquitoes will spread into new areas, and with that the increased potential of mosquito-borne disease,” said Ryan C. Smith, an associate professor of entomology at Iowa State University.He cited the Aedes mosquito’s “strong human preferences” and the fact that they’re “aggressive daytime biters.”“While for the time being this is just a nuisance,” Smith said, “it is important from the perspective that these mosquito species have the potential to transmit a wide range of mosquito-borne viruses.”He cited an outbreak of the Zika virus in Florida in 2016. Zika has been linked to birth defects, brain disorders and other illnesses.“Aedes aegypti in Florida were able to promote Zika virus transmission in and around Miami once it was introduced by human travel,” Smith said.Which brings us back to COVID-19. As Akbari said, researchers wasted little time trying to determine if the virus could be spread by mosquitoes, including Aedes aegypti.The conclusion, as reported a year ago in the scientific journal Nature, is that it can’t, “even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host.”But Akbari and other specialists say we aren’t in the clear.

Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases; that's why some people have been naturally worried about mosquitoes carrying SARS-CoV-2. Official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) says there's no information or evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites. For a mosquito to become infected with a virus, it must be present in the blood the mosquito feeds on. ""SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a respiratory virus that is almost exclusively contained within the lungs and respiratory tract of infected people, and rarely gets into the blood,"" Emily Gallichotte, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of microbiology, immunology, and pathology at Colorado State University, told Health. Mosquitoes are very genetically different from humans.",COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites,no,"

Ahead, an expert sets the record straight.Can mosquitoes carry or spread COVID-19?Good news: There is currently no evidence that mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The novel coronavirus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, which are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Blood doesn’t really factor into that equation, and no cases of COVID-19 originating from mosquitoes have been reported so far.“Mosquitoes don’t transmit everything; they transmit a certain, relatively small number of diseases,” explains Stephen Gluckman, M.D., an infectious disease expert and medical director of Penn Global Medicine. “That has to do with the ability of that disease to live in the mosquito.”In order to spread from a mosquito to a person, a virus must be compatible with both human and insect bodies. But many respiratory viruses just don’t have the ability to replicate inside insects, Dr. Gluckman says, and SARS-CoV-2 (thankfully!)",the buzzing insects also carry and spread the coronavirus,no,"

Key Takeaways

A new study from Kansas State University shows that mosquitoes are not vectors for COVID-19.You should still protect yourself against mosquitoes, because they are currently carriers of dangerous diseases like West Nile and EEE. According to a new study from Kansas State University, mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, published in Scientific Reports on July 17, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 cannot reproduce within mosquitoes and cannot be transmitted to humans through a bite.﻿﻿﻿



The World Health Organization (WHO) previously stated that “there has been no evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes."" Scientists Urge WHO to Update Guidelines

A big concern many have had during the pandemic (especially during warmer months) has been if mosquitoes can spread the coronavirus. With malaria being the most well-known, mosquitoes are notorious spreaders of viral illnesses (such as the EEE outbreak from last summer). Researchers, however, have determined that mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it has no data to support coronavirus transmission via mosquito bite, and, similarly, the World Health Organization said bites will not pass along the virus. Researchers have said that in order for mosquitoes to be able to pass the virus along to a human, the mosquito would first have to become infected with the coronavirus and have it replicate within it. Testing multiple species of mosquitoes, none became infected with the coronavirus.",mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19,no,"

The pathogens mosquitoes spread by sucking our blood cause over half a million deaths each year and hundreds of millions of cases of severe illness. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest mosquitoes are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the coronavirus but based on current understandings, it’s highly unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus by biting an infected person, let alone be able to pass it on.

ENTOMOLOGY 




















It's extremely unlikely mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19 according to entomology professor




















By: Emma Ea Ambrose 










April 21, 2020






















“There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes,” Catherine Hill, professor of entomology and vector biology, said. In the swells of information that have surrounded the COVID-19 pandemic, Hill said one question that keeps popping up is whether animals, including mosquitoes, can infect humans with the virus. Scientists around the world are currently assessing if  mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission but, so far, there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitos are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), in this family are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said.",It’s extremely unlikely,neutral,"

COVID-19, however, has never been seen before, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2. As a whole, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and can affect different species of animals, but rarely can an animal coronavirus infect a human and then spread between people. However, such instances were seen with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and has also now been documented with COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2.CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE LIFTED UNTIL VACCINE FOUND, STUDY SAYS And recently, researchers confirmed that humans spread the virus to tigers at the Bronx Zoo.",whether you can contract COVID-19 through a mosquito bite,neutral,"

Our warming environment is like Christmas for the Aedes mosquito, providing the aggressive, bloodthirsty little creatures with ideal circumstances in which to proliferate.“As the climate becomes warmer, we run the risk that these mosquitoes will spread into new areas, and with that the increased potential of mosquito-borne disease,” said Ryan C. Smith, an associate professor of entomology at Iowa State University.He cited the Aedes mosquito’s “strong human preferences” and the fact that they’re “aggressive daytime biters.”“While for the time being this is just a nuisance,” Smith said, “it is important from the perspective that these mosquito species have the potential to transmit a wide range of mosquito-borne viruses.”He cited an outbreak of the Zika virus in Florida in 2016. Zika has been linked to birth defects, brain disorders and other illnesses.“Aedes aegypti in Florida were able to promote Zika virus transmission in and around Miami once it was introduced by human travel,” Smith said.Which brings us back to COVID-19. As Akbari said, researchers wasted little time trying to determine if the virus could be spread by mosquitoes, including Aedes aegypti.The conclusion, as reported a year ago in the scientific journal Nature, is that it can’t, “even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host.”But Akbari and other specialists say we aren’t in the clear. Next time, they say, things could be different.“As Aedes aegypti becomes more and more prevalent,” Akbari told me, “we could see transmission of more and more pathogens.”Basically, it’s just a matter of chance.“If a person infected with the dengue virus or another virus transmitted by these mosquitoes were to come to California, and that individual was bitten, then it is possible that diseases such as dengue could then be spread,” said Craig Montell, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at UC Santa Barbara.“Dengue causes a wide spectrum of disease,” says the World Health Organization.

CORONAVIRUSIsopropyl alcoholCoronavirushand sanitizerHow To Make Your Own Disinfectant To Kill CoronavirusYou may already have some of the necessary ingredients for DIY wipes and sprays that eliminate COVID-19 (and no, vodka is not one of them).By Casey BondMoney, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPostApr 14, 2020, 07:45 PM EDTThese days, even clean freaks are getting a run for their money. In order to keep the coronavirus at bay, it’s important to disinfect your kitchen, bathrooms ― even the air ― sometimes multiple times per day. But with the recent panic-buying that’s wiped store shelves clean of commercial disinfectants, you might not have the usual products on hand.Fortunately, you can make DIY hand sanitizer, disinfecting spray and wipes. Here’s what you need to know about making your own cleaning products that kill the coronavirus.Advertisement

Items You’ll NeedThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting your home that are crucial to follow when making your own disinfectants. For example, the CDC says that it’s important to use EPA-registered disinfectants that have been vetted for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and allow enough contact time on the surface for the disinfectant to work.There are just a handful of solutions you need for DIY cleaning products, according to Dean Davies, cleaning supervisor for Fantastic Services, which specializes in antiviral sanitization.",vodka is not one of them,neutral,"

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. ""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry,"" the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible. Sold-out hand sanitizer products has many people turning to DIY recipes for making their own. Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images

In its advice to the public on hand hygiene, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that sanitizing the hands with gel should take about 20 seconds.Active ingredientsThe scientists also tested ethanol and isopropanol — the active ingredients of each WHO-recommended formulation — in isolation and in varying concentrations. Their results suggest that either ethanol or isopropanol at a concentration of at least 30% vol/vol is sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.For comparison, the CDC recommend that hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers sold in pharmacies and shops typically have an alcohol concentration of around 60%.Homemade hand sanitizers made without the necessary skills, equipment, and medical-grade ingredients, however, may not contain alcohol concentrations high enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For example, pure rubbing alcohol, or “surgical spirit” in the United Kingdom, and vodka have alcohol concentrations of around 70% and 40%, respectively.But repeated use of rubbing alcohol on the hands can dehydrate the skin, causing inflammation and irritation. And vodka is unsuitable for making hand sanitizer, according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, because it is not the right grade of alcohol.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland — Fact checked by Hannah Flynn —  Updated on Jul 3, 2020Latest newsDementia: More walking, higher intensity activity may help protect brain healthNew study links multiple viral infections to a higher risk of dementiaEstrogen: Women with higher lifetime exposure have lower stroke riskCurcumin and traditional Chinese remedy combo may help treat ulcerative colitisGut microbiome may impact the progression of endometriosisRelated CoverageMaking hand sanitizer at home: What to knowMedically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHTDue to the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, some supplies may be limited, including hand sanitizers.",vodka is unsuitable,neutral,"

According to Dr. Alon Vaisman, an infectious diseases and control physician at the University Health Network, DIY hand sanitizer may be an effective way to prevent the spread of coronavirus if it’s made correctly, but it’s not ideal.“In the right hands, done with a great deal of caution, it may be helpful,” he said. “But people might not do it effectively. People might not know what they’re doing and make concoctions that aren’t effective … and might be costly to them.”“This isn’t a standardized or approved product and it shouldn’t be used in place of other things.”

In order to keep the coronavirus at bay, it’s important to disinfect your kitchen, bathrooms ― even the air ― sometimes multiple times per day. But with the recent panic-buying that’s wiped store shelves clean of commercial disinfectants, you might not have the usual products on hand.Fortunately, you can make DIY hand sanitizer, disinfecting spray and wipes. Here’s what you need to know about making your own cleaning products that kill the coronavirus.Advertisement

Items You’ll NeedThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting your home that are crucial to follow when making your own disinfectants. For example, the CDC says that it’s important to use EPA-registered disinfectants that have been vetted for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and allow enough contact time on the surface for the disinfectant to work.There are just a handful of solutions you need for DIY cleaning products, according to Dean Davies, cleaning supervisor for Fantastic Services, which specializes in antiviral sanitization.",vodka is not one of them,neutral,"

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. ""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry,"" the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible. Sold-out hand sanitizer products has many people turning to DIY recipes for making their own. Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images

In its advice to the public on hand hygiene, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that sanitizing the hands with gel should take about 20 seconds.Active ingredientsThe scientists also tested ethanol and isopropanol — the active ingredients of each WHO-recommended formulation — in isolation and in varying concentrations. Their results suggest that either ethanol or isopropanol at a concentration of at least 30% vol/vol is sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.For comparison, the CDC recommend that hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers sold in pharmacies and shops typically have an alcohol concentration of around 60%.Homemade hand sanitizers made without the necessary skills, equipment, and medical-grade ingredients, however, may not contain alcohol concentrations high enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For example, pure rubbing alcohol, or “surgical spirit” in the United Kingdom, and vodka have alcohol concentrations of around 70% and 40%, respectively.But repeated use of rubbing alcohol on the hands can dehydrate the skin, causing inflammation and irritation. And vodka is unsuitable for making hand sanitizer, according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, because it is not the right grade of alcohol.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland — Fact checked by Hannah Flynn —  Updated on Jul 3, 2020Latest newsDementia: More walking, higher intensity activity may help protect brain healthNew study links multiple viral infections to a higher risk of dementiaEstrogen: Women with higher lifetime exposure have lower stroke riskCurcumin and traditional Chinese remedy combo may help treat ulcerative colitisGut microbiome may impact the progression of endometriosisRelated CoverageMaking hand sanitizer at home: What to knowMedically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHTDue to the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, some supplies may be limited, including hand sanitizers.",vodka is unsuitable,neutral,"

Editor’s Note: This story was published before the World Health Organization declared novel coronavirus a pandemic and Canada’s chief health officer labelled the virus a “serious public health threat.” For the latest coronavirus news, click here. As concern over the novel coronavirus continue to rise in Canada and around the world, some stores have reported dwindling stocks of medical items like face masks, hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol.Public health officials say 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in Canada so far, with 18 cases reported in Ontario and eight in British Columbia. One presumptive positive case has been reported in Quebec.In an effort to prepare for the worst, some people are attempting to make their own hand sanitizer with recipes found online — but is this effective?

According to Dr. Alon Vaisman, an infectious diseases and control physician at the University Health Network, DIY hand sanitizer may be an effective way to prevent the spread of coronavirus if it’s made correctly, but it’s not ideal.“In the right hands, done with a great deal of caution, it may be helpful,” he said. “But people might not do it effectively. People might not know what they’re doing and make concoctions that aren’t effective … and might be costly to them.”“This isn’t a standardized or approved product and it shouldn’t be used in place of other things.”

Ribavirin







Last review completed on
April 19th, 2020


Therapy Description
Activity of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 has been demostrated in vitro (Wang 2020), although it was found to be 100-fold less potent than remdesivir and chloroquine. This may suggest the challenge of narrow therapeutic window for ribavirin. A mouse study (Barnard 2006) of SARS-CoV-1 had demonstrated higher levels of virus in lungs in those treated with ribavirin compared to no treatment. Treatment with interferon-α2b and ribavirin in macaques infected with MERS-CoV (Falzarano 2013) showed benefit of this combination. Combination of LPV/r and ritonavir demonstrated synergy in vitro against SARS-CoV-1 and clinical benefit in patients treated with combination compare to ribavirin alone in historical controls (Chu 2004). Review (Stockman 2006) reported most human clinical studies were inconclusive and some showed harm of ribavirin in treating SARS-CoV-1.",Ribavirin,no,"

This stops certain antiviral drugs like ribavirin from being effective. Fortunately, the coronavirus’ proofreading powers don’t block a similar drug, remdesivir. So remdesivir potently halts coronavirus replication and represents a promising drug option for COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir is also effective against other RNA viruses including Ebola virus and the coronaviruses SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). Scientists are currently assessing remdesivir in clinical trials in the United States and China.",remdesivir,no,"

Ribavirin can be used for COVID-19 (61), and it has also been recommended to use for COVID-19 via intravenous infusion (62), as it binds tightly with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and stops polymerase function (63). However, we need a randomized control trial to elucidate the antiviral potential of ribavirin.

Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted. Keywords:

Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted. Keywords:

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy

The idea is that alkalizing your body (by drinking juice or lemon water, which is acidic in its natural state) creates a less appealing environment for the novel coronavirus. But, unfortunately, the logic is wrong. According to WebMD, there’s no evidence that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or any other means does anything for coronavirus. In fact, it’s even contrary to medical science.

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy

The idea is that alkalizing your body (by drinking juice or lemon water, which is acidic in its natural state) creates a less appealing environment for the novel coronavirus. But, unfortunately, the logic is wrong. According to WebMD, there’s no evidence that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or any other means does anything for coronavirus. In fact, it’s even contrary to medical science. With no specific treatment for COVID-19, getting into good habits and strengthening your immunity against viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, by drinking warm lemon water may help reduce your risk of contracting the disease.",With no specific treatment,no,"
