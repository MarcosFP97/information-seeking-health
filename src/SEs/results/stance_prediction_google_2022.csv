So, what kind of tea bags should be used for wisdom teeth? According to a study in the Hindawi Journal that looked into the effect of green tea extract on the prevention of gingival bleeding after a tooth extraction, green tea contains polyphenol compounds and tannins that have antioxidant properties. These tannins can be significantly effective in stopping the bleeding of sockets caused by tooth extractions and reducing oozing.

IntroductionGingiva is a connective and epithelial tissue that covers the jaw bone around the teeth [1]. Usually, after tooth extraction, especially molars, bleeding occurs due to creation of tooth socket. The amount of bleeding differs based on the tooth type and extent of damage to the tissue and continues in some patient for 1 to 2 days, as the consequent blood clots are unstable and removed with a partial pressure [2]. Most of the time, bleeding is controllable; however, because of bleeding complications like sluggishness, lethargy, and anemia, prevention of bleeding after tooth extraction is mandatory.Several methods have been suggested to reduce the amount of bleeding including the use of anesthetics and materials with vasoconstrictive properties like epinephrine (1/1000), the use of chlorhexidine gel in the days before surgery to reduce the microbial load and topical inflammation [3], and the use of cellulose tampons [4] such as Surgicel tampon [5] and Gelatamp sponge [6], use of systemic preparations of tranexamic acid and vitamin K [7], and application of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue [8].Cellulose tampons stop bleeding to an acceptable extent during 10–15 minutes, but, due to high cost, there is no public access to it [4, 5]. The so-called “Gelatamp” sponges have also shown good effect on cessation of bleeding and reduction of tooth extraction side effects [6].",green tea extract contributes to significant decline in bleeding,neutral,"

Certain teeth simply cannot be saved. While it may not be your preferred choice, the unsalvageable tooth will typically need to be fully extracted. Extractions will cause some bleeding and gauze can control the bleeding. You also may want to place a tea bag on the extraction site to slow or control bleeding, especially if minimal bleeding continues for more than a day.

Follow the same instructions as you would with the gauze noted above. Ensure that a blood clot forms and stays within the tooth socket

Blood clots that form within the empty socket are an important factor within the healing process. You should be careful not to do anything to disrupt its formation. There are many steps to take to protect the developing blood clot within the first 24 hours after a tooth extraction. Avoid vigorous rinsing or spitting

They act as a protective bandage, controlling both swelling and bleeding. For that reason we ask you to “take it easy” the first day.If bleeding seems excessive, remove any blood clots that may have formed outside the tooth sockets, then bite on a dampened tea bag placed directly over the bleeding site. (The tannic acid in the tea helps blood clot.) If bleeding continues an hour after the tea bag is used, then moisten gauze and place in freezer for 20 minutes, then bite on the gauze for 30 minutes.

The acid is known for aiding in blood clot formation, so it may even be better than gauze for this purpose.You can use a tea bag in the same way you use gauze, but you want to be sure that the bag is cold. Using a hot tea bag may soothe your discomfort, but it can dislodge the blood clot and cause more problems than it solves.Ice Cube and Gauze TrickSome patients find more success with stopping their bleeding if they cool their mouth’s temperature. One trick is to wrap ice cubes in gauze and place them on the extraction site.You want to avoid sucking on the ice cube or biting it.Instead, allow them to remain in the gauze and sit on the extraction site. You want to avoid placing the ice cube directly on the socket, which is why using gauze is the right choice when adding ice cubes to the process.Why is Clotting Important?The first 24 hours of healing are very important for tooth extractions and will revolve around the blood clot. Since we’ve removed your tooth, it will leave an empty socket behind where your bone exists.Blood will fill this hole and stop air from reaching the bone.Allowing the clot to form and dry fills in the empty tooth socket and will protect your bone while the area heals.",The acid is known for aiding in blood clot formation,no,"

Can crystals heal?,https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html," Proponents of this technique believe that crystals act as conduits for healing — enabling positive, healing energy to flow into the body as negative, disease-causing energy flows out. But despite the fact that crystal healing has seen an upsurge in popularity in recent years, this alternative treatment is not popular with most medical doctors and scientists, many of whom refer to crystal healing as a pseudoscience. Scientifically speaking, there is no evidence that crystal healing can be used to cure diseases, because diseases have never been found to be the result of a so-called energy flow in the body. Furthermore, no scientific studies have shown that crystals and gems can be differentiated by chemical composition or color to treat a particular ailment. ""I am not aware of any [National Science Foundation]-supported studies into the healing powers of crystals,"" Peter Heaney, a mineral sciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, told the ""Washington Post (opens in new tab)"" in 2021.

Can crystals heal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/healing-crystals-what-they-can-do-and-what-they-cant," One common belief is that crystals interact with the body’s energy fields, also known as vibrational energy. The idea is that crystals can redirect and re-channel energy flow with their unique energetic vibrations, helping to unblock areas of the body or energy field that have become “stuck.”“Crystals have potent healing powers, and when we touch them, healing is immediately activated,” says cosmic energy healer Eva Antoniadou. As the crystal vibrations interact with the body’s natural energetic frequency, the body is said to be left feeling focused, relaxed, and clear. “Crystals absorb energy from pressure and movement and convert it into an electronic frequency,” says Polack. “It’s this frequency, unique to each type of crystal, that users are relying on when working with crystals, and given that many pain and anxiety relief devices work on similar principles, we do believe they can help in these areas.”Methods of treating pain and other disorders with electrical current include:radiofrequency ablation (RFA)electronic muscle stimulation (EMS)transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Compared to these therapies, any frequency a crystal might emit would be infinitesimal.

In short, the belief is that certain stones can help guide healing energy into the body, while ushering out negative, disease-causing energy. This supposedly occurs through your body’s energy field, or chakra; the energy is variably referred to as “qi,” “prana,” or “universal energy,” according to Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator at McGill Office for Science & Society in Montréal.Crystals are often incorporated into practices like reiki, a Japanese form of energy healing, and in specific crystal-healing practices like “crystal surgery,” wherein a practitioner uses crystals as tools for “operating” on the body’s energy field (don’t worry, it’s not an invasive practice—no scalpel required). In these treatments, practitioners attempt to “unblock” areas of our energy field that are “stuck.”But it’s not so easy to measure whether such bodily energy exists in the first place, Jarry says. Scientists can study other forms of energy, like gravity or the energy contained in food, because we can see an apple fall from a tree, and we can zoom in on the process of glucose from an apple breaking down into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for our cells.

If you’re plugged into the world of alternative medicine, you’ve probably heard about “crystals”— the name given to minerals (usually quartz) or fossilized resins that are believed to have beneficial health properties. Holding crystals or placing them on your body is thought to promote physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Crystals supposedly do this by positively interacting with your body’s energy field, or chakra.

Rather, the powers or vibrations people claim to feel from crystals are more likely to be a case of being susceptible to the power of suggestion, or the placebo effect. In saying that, the power of positive thought has been proved to reduce the risk of disease. For example, Johns Hopkins expert Lisa R. Yanek, M.P.H., found that people with a family history of heart disease who also had a positive outlook were one-third less likely to have a heart attack or other cardiovascular event within five to 25 years than those with a more negative outlook. Additional studies have found that a positive attitude improves outcomes and life satisfaction across a spectrum of conditions—including traumatic brain injury, stroke and brain tumors.

This type of relaxation helps aid general well-being and is particularly useful when treating stress and anxiety. It can also help ease tense muscles which can help improve physical pain and sleeping problems. On an emotional and spiritual level, crystals can help enhance self-esteem, encourage clarity and inspire a sense of peace and centredness.",Crystal healing is a complementary and natural approach,yes,"

“Crystal healing”,





                simply put, is the healing and balancing of one’s body,
                mind and energy through healing powers of
                crystals. Crystal
                  healing is a superstitious treatment, carried
                out through a number of methods ranging from intricate
                to very simple. Each crystal varies in healing qualities depending on
                the type of crystal and its shape. 1. Turquoise

In 1880, French physicist Pierre Curie (Marie Curie’s husband) discovered that putting pressure on various crystals – including quartz, topaz and tourmaline – created electricity. This phenomenon, called the Piezoelectric effect, is why crystals are used as essential elements in computers, TV screens, iPhones and satellites. Limited studies have indicated that crystals can increase the alkalinity of water – so the makers of Glacce water bottles, which expose H2O to stones such as obsidian and rose quartz, might be on to something.

Type II collagen is one of the main proteins in cartilage. It’s been suggested that taking collagen hydrolysate can improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis by stimulating your body’s production of joint collagen. Some studies have suggested that autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by taking a foreign antigen (a substance that causes your immune system to react to it) by mouth, which could dampen down your immune system’s reaction.

The standard of care focuses primarily on alleviating symptoms but medications prescribed for arthritis often have unwanted side effects.According to a recent review published in the journal International Orthopaedics, researchers have demonstrated that collagen protein supplementation can improve osteoarthritis symptoms.The review consisted of 5 separate randomized controlled trials published from 2009 to 2016, with a total of 519 patients. Treatment periods ranged from 10 weeks to 48 weeks. Treatment with collagen supplementation demonstrated a significant reduction of the total WOMAC index, a clinical tool used to assess the degree of arthritis (1) , and a significant reduction in stiffness and VAS score (a clinical “scoring” tool used to assess degree of pain) .The beneficial effects of collagen for the treatment and prevention of arthritis are not recognized by the conventional medical community. As described in my book, “The Collagen Diet,” collagen peptides that are broken into small fragments are the specific type of collagen that has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of degenerative conditions, including osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.When we ingest collagen peptides, they are further broken down into single amino acids and peptides consisting of 2-3 amino acids.

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet," Why has there been concern that cell phones may cause cancer? There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems: Cell phones emit radiation (in the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones would be of concern given how many people use them. Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health. However, the evidence to date suggests that cell phone use does not cause brain or other kinds of cancer in humans.",Cell phones emit radiation,neutral,"

Non-cancerous tumors of the brain, such as meningiomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the nerve connecting the brain to the ear (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas)
Tumors of the salivary glands

A few studies have also looked at possible links to other types of cancer. What do studies show? Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to determine if something might cause cancer:

Studies done in the lab (using lab animals or cell cultures)
Studies looking at groups of people

In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own to show if something causes cancer in people, so researchers usually look at both lab-based and human studies.

It's called non-ionizing radiation, and it's the same type you find in FM radio waves and microwaves.It’s different from ionizing radiation, which comes from things like X-rays and ultraviolet light.",no one can say for sure,neutral,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.mskcc.org/news/do-cell-phones-cause," He said it caused his wife’s brain tumor. Ever since, the question of whether cell phones cause cancer has buzzed quietly in the background as the technology has become omnipresent in our lives.Numerous studies of cell phone radiation and cancer have been conducted over the years to address the issue, but none has been definitive.To obtain more solid evidence, a team of scientists at the National Toxicology Program, a division of the National Institutes of Health, undertook an in-depth study. Their approach was to expose laboratory rodents to high doses of cell phone radiation over their entire life span and see if they developed cancer as a result. The study cost $20 million and took more than ten years to complete. Final results were released to the public in November 2018.

NTP scientists had exposed thousands of rats and mice (whose biological similarities to humans make them useful indicators of human health risks) to doses of radiation equivalent to an average mobile user’s lifetime exposure.The peer review scientists repeatedly upgraded the confidence levels the NTP’s scientists and staff had attached to the study, fuelling critics’ suspicions that the NTP’s leadership had tried to downplay the findings. Thus the peer review also found “some evidence” – one step below “clear evidence” – of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands.Not one major news organisation in the US or Europe reported this scientific news. But then, news coverage of mobile phone safety has long reflected the outlook of the wireless industry. For a quarter of a century now, the industry has been orchestrating a global PR campaign aimed at misleading not only journalists, but also consumers and policymakers about the actual science concerning mobile phone radiation. Indeed, big wireless has borrowed the very same strategy and tactics big tobacco and big oil pioneered to deceive the public about the risks of smoking and climate change, respectively.",radiation from mobile phones causes cancer,yes,"

After reading many animal toxicology studies that found that this radiation could increase oxidative stress — free radicals, stress proteins and DNA damage — I became increasingly convinced that what we were observing in our review of human studies was indeed a real risk. While Myung and his colleagues were visiting the Center for Family and Community Health, you reviewed case-control studies examining the association between mobile phone use and tumor risk. What did you find? Our 2009 review, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found that heavy cellphone use was associated with increased brain cancer incidence, especially in studies that used higher quality methods and studies that had no telecommunications industry funding. Last year, we updated our review, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, based on a meta-analysis of 46 case-control studies — twice as many studies as we used for our 2009 review — and obtained similar findings.",cellphone radiation could cause cancer,yes,"

Researchers took a comprehensive look at statistical findings from 46 different studies around the globe and found that the use of a cell phone for more than 1,000 hours, or about 17 minutes a day over a ten year period, increased the risk of tumors by 60 percent. Researchers also pointed to findings that showed cell phone use for 10 or more years doubled the risk of brain tumors. Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health conducted the research in partnership with Korea’s National Cancer Center, and Seoul National University. Their analysis took a comprehensive look at statistical findings from case control studies from 16 countries including the U.S., Sweden, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand.

These studies were not for heavy phone users. The findings of these studies are mixed, but overall, they do not show an association between cell phone use and cancer. Mobile technologies are improving all the time, so that the more recent generations emit substantially lower output power. Nevertheless, given the lack of evidence for heavy users, advising mobile phone users to reduce unnecessary exposures remains a good precautionary approach.”

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/cell_phones._faq.html, Some people wonder if cell phones can cause health problems. Here’s what you should know about cell phones and your health. Can using a cell phone cause cancer?There is no scientific evidence that provides a definite answer to that question. Some organizations recommend caution in cell phone use. More research is needed before we know if using cell phones causes health effects.

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.brainandlife.org/articles/how-safe-are-cell-phones," Some scientists argue no plausible biological mechanism exists by which cell phone radiation could cause cancer. ""It's impossible for cell phones to cause cancer because the electromagnetic fields they generate cannot break chemical bonds between molecules,"" says Gary Arendash, Ph.D., a research professor at the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. That process, he explains, is thought to be key to increasing cancer risk. ""UV light from the sun causes skin cancer, for example. But cell phones provide radiation that is thousands of times weaker than UV rays and X-rays—it's similar to that generated by a one-watt flashlight. This is too weak to cause cancer.""",It's impossible,no,"

In addition, we did not consider ipsilateral and contralateral use of the cellular phones, which is beyond the scope of our study. Lastly, although we reported exposure-response relationships between the cellular phone use and the cancer risk, it would be ideal to investigate those associations based on the actual time spent on cellular phones provided by the mobile telecommunication companies. However, most studies did not use those data. Further studies using the exact data on the time spent on cellular phones are warranted to confirm our findings.5. ConclusionsIn sum, the updated comprehensive meta-analysis of case-control studies found significant evidence linking cellular phone use to increased tumor risk, especially among cell phone users with cumulative cell phone use of 1000 or more hours in their lifetime (which corresponds to about 17 min per day over 10 years), and especially among studies that employed high quality methods.",increased tumor risk,neutral,"

Hi Dale, Some people find WD-40 can help with arthritis, not as a treatment but by being a helping hand for many every day activities. Activities such as helping sliding doors glide easier, unsticking difficult to open windows, keeping scissors and garden tools working smoothly to name a few. Reply

I remember hearing about using WD-40 on stiff knee joints a few months ago and many people say it helps lubricate thier knee joints. People swear by it, saying before they used WD-40 thier knees felt stiff and hurt, but after spraying WD-40 pain and stiffness went away.I think the whole things crazy and GP's advise is not to use it as it contains petroleum-related products that could irritate the skin. There a news article about how WD-40 helps arthritus and a 70-year-old retired sales manager from Stamford, Lincs, says: Its been an absolute godsend for me, WD-40 has given me a hell of a lot of relief, A few weeks ago, I was even running around the garden with my grandson. I havent been able to do that for about three years.  The Daily Mail Online article published on the 21 October 2013 that you can read by clicking on the link below.",WD-40 helps arthritus,yes,"

SymptomsMosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren't covered by clothing. Symptoms include:

An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite
A painful spot that looks like a hive and forms within 24 hours after a bite
Small blisters

A severe reaction to mosquito bites can cause:

A large, swollen, inflamed area
A hive-like rash
Swelling around the eyes

Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults.

Can mosquito bites make you sick?,https://www.mosquitomagnet.com/articles/symptoms-you-shouldnt-ignore-if-youve-been-bitten-by-a-mosquito," Since mosquito bites are usually an inconsequential annoyance, you might not even connect your headache or fever to the mosquito bite you had three days before. If you’re experiencing symptoms or sickly feelings, knowing that you were bitten and passing this information along to your doctor can lead to the right diagnosis — especially if you have been exposed to a mosquito-borne illness. Symptoms to Look for: The three most common symptoms of mosquito-borne illnesses are:

Fever
Fatigue
Headache

Whether you have recently traveled somewhere where outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses are common or you’ve recently been bit at home, if you’re experiencing any of these symptoms – visit your doctor, even if the mosquito bite has completely healed. Diseases You Can Catch From Mosquitoes: What are some of the most common mosquito-borne illnesses? Watch out for the following symptoms, especially if you have traveled anywhere where there are outbreaks:

Mild headaches: Having a mild headache is considered a moderate reaction to a mosquito bite, normally appearing in those who have a weakened immune system. You can experience slight pain or tension, but it is not usually persistent and can be relieved used conventional painkillers or home solutions. If your headache intensifies or is prolonged, it might be a sign of a more serious illness and you should consult your doctor as soon as possible


Low fever: A mild or low fever is a symptom that can sometimes occur, normally when the immune system is struggling to fight off an invasive pathogen. You might find that your temperature is slightly, but not alarmingly, higher than usual. This symptom should begin to diminish within a few days but if it persists or worsens, you should speak to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a more serious, mosquito-borne illness. Serious mosquito bite symptoms

To control and treat malaria, early diagnosis is crucial.West Nile virus: Most people with West Nile Virus show no symptoms, although some develop a fever or other flu-like symptoms. For a small number of people with the virus, a serious illness develops in the nervous system.Zika virus: This is a generally mild condition that initially causes fever, joint pain, and rash. The initial symptoms of Zika usually pass after 1 week, but the disease can lead to congenital anomalies if a woman becomes pregnant after receiving a mosquito bite.Yellow fever: This virus causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.

Not everyone bitten by a mosquito carrying a virus will develop symptoms. New research suggests the worse our reactions to mosquito bites, the more likely it is we’ll get sick. The scientists allowed the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, to bite laboratory mice and then injected the mice with Semliki Forest virus (an African mosquito-borne virus that generally causes mild symptoms in humans) via syringe. Other mice were only injected with the virus. What they found was that the immune cells that rushed to the bite site as part of an inflammatory response helped the virus replicate and spread. Mice without mosquito bites had substantially lower rates of infection.",more likely it is we’ll get sick,neutral,"

Can mosquito bites make you sick?,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insect-bites-and-stings/," Read more about treating insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice
Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if:

you're worried about a bite or sting 
your symptoms do not start to improve within a few days or are getting worse 
you've been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes 
a large area (around 10cm or more patch of skin) around the bite becomes red and swollen 
you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness 
you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a high temperature, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms



When to get emergency medical help
Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as:

wheezing or difficulty breathing 
a swollen face, mouth or throat 
feeling sick or being sick
a fast heart rate 
dizziness or feeling faint 
difficulty swallowing
loss of consciousness 

Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings
There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should:

remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees – don't wave your arms around or swat at them 
cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers 
wear shoes when outdoors 
apply insect repellent to exposed skin – repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective 
avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants – these can attract insects 
be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served 

You may need to take extra precautions if you're travelling to part of the world where there's a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about preventing insect bites and stings.",there's a risk of serious illnesses,neutral,"

Am I more at risk if my relatives have cancer? Some types of cancer can run in families. For example, your risks of developing certain types of breast cancer, bowel cancer or ovarian cancer are higher if you have close relatives who developed the condition.This doesn't mean you'll definitely get cancer if some of your close family members have it, but that you may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with other people.It's estimated that between 3 and 10 in every 100 cancers are associated with an inherited faulty gene.Cancers caused by inherited faulty genes are much less common than those caused by other factors, such as ageing, smoking, being overweight and not exercising regularly, or not eating a healthy, balanced diet. Most cancers develop as a result of a combination of risk factors, which in some cases can include family history.Some types of cancer are less likely to be genetic, such as cervical cancer and lung cancer.It's only likely that a cancer gene is present in a family if:there are 2 or more close relatives on the same side of the family (your mother's or your father's side) with the same type of cancer, or with particular types of cancer that are known to be linked – for example, breast and ovarian cancer or bowel and womb cancercancers are occurring at young ages (before the age of 50)a close relative has had 2 different types of cancer (rather than 1 cancer that has spread)You should contact your GP if some close family members have developed the types of cancer mentioned above and you're worried that you might develop cancer yourself. They'll ask about your family history, and if they think there's a chance you have an increased risk of developing cancer, they'll refer you to a genetic counsellor, family cancer clinic or a cancer specialist.Cancer Research UK has more information about family history and inherited cancer genes

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.genomemedical.com/education-cards/what-types-of-cancer-can-run-in-families-because-of-genetics/," Although cancer is common, only 5-10% of it is hereditary, meaning an individual has inherited an increased risk for cancer from one of their parents. This inherited risk for cancer is caused by a small change (called a mutation) in a gene, which can be passed from one generation to the next in a family. When someone inherits this type of gene mutation from a parent, they have an increased risk to get a certain type (or types) of cancer. Some cancers that can be hereditary are:

Breast cancer
Colon cancer
Prostate cancer
Ovarian cancer
Uterine cancer
Melanoma (a type of skin cancer)
Pancreatic cancer

Family members share genes and may, therefore, share cancer gene mutations. Relatives with the same cancer gene mutation usually share an increased risk to get cancer. Sometimes, a single gene mutation that increases the risk for cancer can increase the risk for more than one type of cancer.",only 5-10% of it is hereditary,neutral,"

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/inherited-cancers," In contrast, the term “inherited cancer” is used to refer to familial cancers in which a genetic cause has been identified.The children of parents with an inherited cancer genetic mutation have a 50 percent chance of also having the mutation. If you have several family members who had cancer or some family members with cancer at a relatively young age (younger than age 50) talk to your doctor about genetic testing for yourself and your family. What makes Yale Medicine unique in its approach to inherited cancers?Yale Medicine cancer genetics specialists work closely together to identify possible genetic causes of cancer as early as possible. Ongoing research at Yale Cancer Center helps inform physicians of the latest treatments used to intercept cancer, such as new drugs or surgical procedures.

All cancer is triggered by altered genes. However, only five to 10 per cent of cancers are actually hereditary. Heredity may sometimes appear to be the reason for a cancer, especially when the same types of cancers run in families.

Genes and cancer



















Does cancer run in families? Some inherited mutations make a person more likely to develop certain types of cancer. This means a gene mutation that is linked to cancer may run in a family. If you inherit a gene mutation like this from one of your parents , it does not mean you have cancer. More damage (acquired mutations) still needs to happen before a cancer can develop. The inherited gene mutation may allow this damage to build up faster.",Some inherited mutations,neutral,"

How are cancer genes inherited? Genetic conditions can be passed through a family in several ways. We have two copies of every gene because we inherit one copy from our mother and one copy from our father. In turn, one copy of each gene is passed on to a child. For some mutations, called autosomal dominant, inheriting one copy of a mutated gene is enough to increase the risk of developing cancer. When a person has an autosomal dominant mutation, there is a 50% chance that the mutation was inherited from their mother and a 50% chance that the mutation was inherited from their father.",Genetic conditions can be passed through a family in several ways,neutral,"

OVERVIEW

Approximately 5-10% of all cancers are hereditary. An additional 10-30% of individuals may be at increased risk because they have close family members who also had cancer, suggesting a familial link, even though no specific hereditary link was found. There are many types of familial cancers. For example, in certain families, women have a higher propensity to develop breast and/or ovarian cancer. This is known as Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome (HBOC), which is often caused by an inherited mutation in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene (BRCA1/2). Harmful variants in BRCA1/2 may lead to an increased chance of developing other cancers as well, such as fallopian tube, peritoneal, melanoma, pancreas, and/or prostate cancer.",Approximately 5-10% of all cancers are hereditary,yes,"

Although many cancers happen randomly, there’s a lot you can do to lower your risk with a healthy lifestyle.There’s even some evidence that nutrition and lifestyle choices may impact the way certain genes behave. For example, one study from the University of California, San Francisco, found that after 3 months of eating healthfully and exercising regularly, men with early stage prostate cancer had less activity in genes that play a role in whether cancer tumors form, while certain cancer-fighting genes were more active.The bottom line?

Are vaccines linked to autism?,https://cpp-hov.netlify.app/getting-vaccinated/vaccine-faq/do-vaccines-cause-autism," The role of vaccines has been questioned, along with other possible risk factors for ASD, such as genetic predisposition, advanced parental age, and other environmental factors. Vaccines have perhaps received more scrutiny than any other speculated cause of ASD, and most scientists, physicians, and public health researchers have come to the conclusion that there is no association between vaccines and autism. [6] Some, however, still question whether vaccines play a role in ASD development. And so, public health and medical establishments continue to address these concerns. The MMR HypothesisThe story of how vaccines were questioned as a cause of autism dates back to the 1990s. In 1995, a group of British researchers published a cohort study in the Lancet showing that individuals who had been vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) were more likely to have bowel disease than individuals who had not received MMR.",there is no association between vaccines and autism,no,"

Relative to the total number of people with ASD, very few parents actually report a dramatic loss of skills associated with a specific vaccination. However, parents who choose not to vaccinate their child (hoping to protect against autism) expose their child to other health concerns. And unfortunately, some of these unvaccinated children develop ASD anyway. Because professionals cannot provide parents a definitive explanation for the onset of autism in their child, any parent questioning the role of vaccines is understandable, but science does not support a link.

No link between autism and childhood vaccinationsWe don’t know exactly what causes autism, but there are many theories. Some theories have good evidence, but other theories are unproven, with little or no scientific evidence behind them.One of these unproven theories is that autism is caused by childhood vaccinations, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunisation. Another theory is that the mercury-based preservative (thiomersal) that was once used in vaccinations is to blame.Although these issues were of particular concern in the 1990s and early 2000s, many studies have been conducted since then. We now know that there is no scientific evidence that either the MMR vaccine or mercury is involved in the development of autism.In other words, vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism.There’s no one proven answer to the question of what causes autism. But causes might include brain development and genetic factors.MMR and autism: discredited theoriesIn 1998, researcher Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a paper in the medical journal The Lancet describing an apparently new syndrome linking developmental disorders (like autism) and bowel problems in children who had previously been developing typically.In 8 of only 12 cases studied, parents linked the beginning of the behaviour difficulties with the MMR vaccination.The researchers stated that they did not prove a link between the MMR vaccine and the new syndrome.

Can baking soda help to cure cancer?,https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/baking-soda," The findings are complicated.There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer. It’s important to remember that cancer grows quite well in healthy tissue with normal pH levels. Additionally, naturally acidic environments, like the stomach, don’t encourage cancer growth.Once cancer cells begin to grow, they produce an acidic environment that encourages malignant growth. The goal of many researchers is to decrease the acidity of that environment so that the cancer cells aren’t able to thrive.A 2009 study published in Cancer Research found that injecting bicarbonate into mice reduced tumor pH levels and slowed the progression of metastatic breast cancer.The acidic microenvironment of tumors may be related to chemotherapeutic failure in cancer treatment. Cancer cells are difficult to target because the area around them is acidic, though they’re alkaline. Many cancer drugs have trouble passing through these layers.Several studies have evaluated the use of antacid drugs in combination with chemotherapy.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed for the treatment of acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).",There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer,neutral,"

Can Baking Soda Help Fight Cancer? By Contributing Writer  - June 08, 2018 
                                
Chances are you’ve used baking soda to cook, freshen up your refrigerator and brighten your smile, but a study published in the journal Cell says this cheap, simple substance may help chemotherapy attack cancer. Chemotherapy works by destroying actively growing cells, but tumors often cut off the oxygen supply of cells inside of them. This causes the cells to shut down, making it difficult for chemotherapy to work. Scientists at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Moffitt Cancer Center looked at breast and colon cancers in mice and saw an increase in cell activity after giving the mice water mixed with baking soda, also known as bicarbonate soda.","cheap, simple substance may help chemotherapy attack cancer",neutral,"

   Summary  

Baking soda is an alkaline mineral (meaning it can neutralize acidity) that is used in a variety of ways. Since cancer cells flourish in acidic environments, some people believe that baking soda may help neutralize acidity in the body to help fight against cancer. Baking soda does not prevent or cure cancer, but animal studies and small trials suggest it may help make chemotherapy and other cancer treatments more effective. Though baking soda shows promise as a complementary treatment, the lack of human clinical trials means that you must approach its use with caution. A Word From Verywell

(Raghunand 2003) This type of treatment has been found to “enhance the anti-tumor activity” of other anticancer drugs. This is very similar to the recently published research of injecting O2 directly into tumors where such direct administration of Oxygen also facilitated the action of chemotherapy. This year these same researchers reported that bicarbonate increases tumor pH (i.e., make it more alkaline) and also inhibits spontaneous metastases (Robey 2009).

Baking soda, the simple household product familiar to everybody, may revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer, researchers at Israel’s Technion Institute have discovered. A graduate research student at the Technion Institute has found a revolutionary solution for the treatment of breast cancer, showing that sodium bicarbonate – baking soda – can increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment because this natural substance changes the acidity of the cancerous tumor and thus increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy. “Many studies show and emphasize the importance of the environment of the tumor in supporting cancer cells and the ability of the cells to penetrate nearby tissues and send metastases to other organs of the body,” explained Dr. Hanan Abumanhal, a resident of northern Israel who got her PhD degree last week at the prestigious institution. Dr. Abumanhal knew that environmental changes in the cancerous tumor tissue can affect the response of cells to treatments and encourage the development of resistance to anti-cancer treatment. “That is why it is important to develop a synergistic treatment that changes the entire environmental balance and thus ‘suffocate’ the tumor,” she explained. Dr. Abumanhal focused on a particularly aggressive version of breast cancer, a version created from a combination of mutations and therefore relatively resistant to existing treatments.",may revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer,neutral,"

Could baking soda improve cancer treatment? This cheap and simple intervention may eventually improve current cancer treatments.Share on PinterestBaking soda could help to boost immunotherapy.Within tumors, large portions are deprived of oxygen. Scientists know that these hypoxic regions tend to be the most resistant to treatment.If a cell is unable to access adequate oxygen, it slows down and enters what is known as a quiescent state.The molecular switch mTORC1 is responsible for assessing the situation before telling the cell whether or not it should divide.If mTORC1 is not present, the cell’s internal processes are shut down. Deep within tumors, mTORC1 activity is almost non-existent.Baking soda, acid, and cancerNew research delves deeper into this mechanism and finds an incredibly simple way to reverse it: baking soda.The study took place at the Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania, both of which are located in Philadelphia.

That allows chemotherapy and other treatments to find and destroy cancer cells or, as Dang puts it, “bring them out into daylight, so you can see them and target them.”
While this isn’t the first time that baking soda has been investigated as a potential aid to cancer therapy, it’s the first study to reveal how and why it’s able to help. “The excitement here is this very simple concept that has been around for a while now has some mechanism behind it,” Dang said.

	Baking soda had previously been reported to enhance cancer immunotherapy by one of the coauthors of the new study, Robert Gillies, Ph.D., of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, though the mechanism underlying the effect was unclear. In the current study, the Ludwig scientists emphasized the importance of the peripheral scattering of lysosomes in acidic conditions, an effect that has been observed in other studies, though not in the context of mTORC1 activation, which appears to be governed by the spatial positioning, or repositioning, of the mTORC1 signaling elements. These mechanistic details are relevant to the study of cancer because researchers have long known that quiescent cells cannot typically be killed by chemotherapy. Notably, Dang and his team also found that T-cell activation, which is essential to most immunotherapies, is similarly compromised under acidic conditions. “We started out with a question about oxygen starvation and the circadian clock, and we ended up discovering a new mechanism by which acidic conditions in tissues shut off a lot of things—including the cell’s molecular clock,” muses Dang.

If a squat exercise is causing you knee pain, it could be due to improper posture and form. Making a few small changes while squatting can actually prevent knee pain and protect your joints from more serious injuries, like sprains or tendonitis. Squatting with incorrect posture can cause strains, Dr. Enad says. To avoid these injuries, he suggests not to hunch too far forward during a squat or to stand too stiff, which can cause pain. ""Focus on squatting movements where the hips shift back rather than straight down,"" says professional strength and conditioning coach Jerry Handley, owner and head coach at Viking Performance Training.

Research agrees that forces inside the ACL and PCL (two major ligaments in the knee) decrease the more the knee is bent. Theoretically, if there were an issue, it’d be with pressure on the meniscus or the patellar, because those two areas have more contact the deeper the squats go.

Alexander Russoniello, M.D. There are many reasons why squatting may cause pain, from a temporary injury to an age-related chronic condition. If pain is intense and unexpected when you squat, or if it has advanced from minor twinges to a more dramatic, stabbing pain, see your doctor to learn what’s causing the problem. “Don’t let knee pain keep you from the activities that you enjoy,” says Alexander P. Russoniello, M.D., Chair of Orthopedics at JFK University Medical Center. “Some people with knee pain may bow out of things that they love doing, but inactivity may make the pain worse.”

Are squats bad for knees?,https://www.healthline.com/health/knee-arthritis-exercises-to-avoid," As long as you’re able to practice with minimal knee joint discomfort, it’s safe to include squats in your exercise routine.People with arthritis may find the most benefit in wall squats, since squatting against the wall can help reduce your risk of putting unnecessary or incorrect pressure on your knees.To do a basic squat:Stand with your back against a wall. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your heels about 18 inches away from wall.Keep your knees in line with your heels, not out in front of your toes.Breathe in and exhale as you sit down or “squat.” Your buttocks shouldn’t drop any lower than knee level.Keep your abdominal muscles tight and ensure that your back is pressed flat against the wall.Push up through your heels — not the balls of your feet — and inhale as you stand up.“Keep the knee over the ankle and not over the ball of the foot,” Bell cautions.“If you begin to experience intense pain at any point — more than your typical knee pain — you should stop the practice for the day. “Be sure to give the move another try during your next practice. You’ll find that your pain threshold increases as you build up muscle strength.”How to practice deep lungingFor people with knee osteoarthritis, lunging poses the same benefits and risks as deep squatting. Lunges are a great way to improve your overall leg and hip strength, but they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly.The trick, Bell says, is to make sure your knee doesn’t extend past your ankle.You may also find it helpful to practice lunges while holding on to the back of a chair or table for added support.To do a basic lunge:Grab on to your support, if needed.Step forward with one leg.",they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly,neutral,"

Are squats bad for knees?,https://kevinleenfitness.com/are-squats-bad-for-your-knees/," However, if you want to reduce the load placed on the knees:

Bend from the hips slightly sooner (think “hips back”)
Place the barbell slightly lower on your back (“low bar”). This encourages you to load the hips more
Widen your stance by a few more inches

To sum up about whether squats are bad for your knees:The answer is no provided you learn and use decent form.Can squatting with bad form be bad for your knees? The answer is yes! References:

Whether you’re setting records in the gym or going for a run, you’ve likely experienced knee pain. In fact, chronic knee pain affects about 25% of adults, according to the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. It’s one of the most common sports– and workout-related injuries there is, and that pesky pain can hinder even the toughest athlete from getting reps in on the squat rack. “Most commonly, the knee pain people refer to in the gym has to do with the anterior (front) part of the knee,” says David Otey, C.S.C.S., a personal training manager at Equinox.",If your knees hurt,neutral,"

4 Reasons Squatting Is Great for Knee Health 






 

										July 9, 2022					



 


Knee 








Squatting often gets a bad reputation because it can be associated with knee pain. However, if you have a good base of mobility and strength in your core, hips, thighs, feet, and ankles, then squatting can be a powerful exercise to develop leg and core strength and prevent knee problems. For both men and women, maintaining strength in your legs and core is essential for living a healthy and active life. As we age, maintaining good muscle mass and overall strength are necessary to prevent injuries and preserve mobility. Learning or improving your squat technique is one of the most effective movements for improving multiple areas of strength within your body. If you have knee pain, they should be part of your rehabilitation program once your pain subsides and you have developed prerequisite mobility and strength in your legs and core.",Squatting often gets a bad reputation,neutral,"

Are squats bad for knees?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23821469/," The aim of this literature review is to assess whether squats with less knee flexion (half/quarter squats) are safer on the musculoskeletal system than deep squats. A search of relevant scientific publications was conducted between March 2011 and January 2013 using PubMed. Over 164 articles were included in the review. There are no realistic estimations of knee-joint forces for knee-flexion angles beyond 50° in the deep squat. Based on biomechanical calculations and measurements of cadaver knee joints, the highest retropatellar compressive forces and stresses can be seen at 90°. With increasing flexion, the wrapping effect contributes to an enhanced load distribution and enhanced force transfer with lower retropatellar compressive forces.",squats with less knee flexion,neutral,"

They include:ACE inhibitorsAlpha-blockersCalcium channel blockersARBsACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors -- such as Capoten, Lotensin, Prinivil, and Zestril for example -- widen blood vessels and increase blood flow.

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004343/," The currently available ones inhibit l-type channels in humans and seem to have a neutral effect on erectile function (47). Possibly this is because this channel is linked with nNOS activation from cholinergic nerve endings into the penis, which is important for NO release and consequently erection. However, although this channel is inhibited, nNOS from nitrergic nerves will be activated, allowing the erectile process to begin. Another class of antihypertensive drugs is the ACE inhibitors. They act by mimicking the structure of the ACE substrate, directly blocking Ang II formation and at the same time increasing bradykinin levels. The net results are reduced vasoconstriction, decreased sodium and water retention, and increased vasodilation through bradykinin.As a future antihypertensive treatment, there is theoretical evidence that gene therapy may produce long-lasting antihypertensive effects by influencing the genes associated with hypertension.",seem to have a neutral effect on erectile function,neutral,"

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://www.forhims.com/blog/does-lisinopril-cause-ed," Start visitLearn moreDo Other ACE Inhibitors Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Several other ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and other heart health issues. These include benazepril (Lotensin®), enalapril (Vasotec®), candesartan (Atacand®), fosinopril (Monopril®) and others.In general, erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect of ACE inhibitors. Other medications for high blood pressure, including alpha-blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), also rarely contribute to ED.Is it Safe to Use ED Medication with Lisinopril?Currently, the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction are PDE5 inhibitor medications, such as sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), vardenafil (Levitra®) and avanafil (Stendra®).These medications work by increasing the rate of blood flow to the erectile tissue of your penis, making it easier to get and maintain an erection when you’re sexually aroused. Because PDE5 inhibitors and anti-hypertensive medications both improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, there’s a risk of interactions when ED medications are used with some common medications for high blood pressure. For example, many medications for ED can interact with organic nitrates and nitrites, as well as alpha-blockers used to treat high blood pressure and/or heart failure. Our guide to Viagra and nitrates provides more information on these interactions and their often severe health risks.Research suggests that ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, on the other hand, do not increase the risk of side effects with ED medications such as sildenafil.If you currently use lisinopril or other medication to control your blood pressure, it’s important to inform your healthcare provider about this before using any ED medications.How to Maintain Healthy ErectionsIf you’re prescribed lisinopril or similar medication to treat high blood pressure, there are several things that you can do to improve your erections and sexual health naturally:Keep active.",erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect of ACE inhibitors,no,"

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://rexmd.com/learn/does-lisinopril-cause-erectile-dysfunction," The researchers attribute the initial decline in sexual interaction to the psychological effects of hypertension diagnosis and first treatment, and conclude that the ""low incidence of sexual dysfunction with ACE inhibitors [is] probably due to the fact that these drugs work through channels other than the sympathetic nervous system in lowering [blood pressure]."" What Does Cause Erectile Dysfunction? While it seems that the connection between lisinopril, ACE inhibitors, and erectile dysfunction is slim at best, there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction. In general, conditions that negatively impact the strength of blood flow or volume will have a negative impact on erections. The most common physical issues that are connected to erectile dysfunction are high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. For every underlying condition or ""co-morbidity"", your risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases; however, erectile dysfunction is not just a physical condition.",there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction,neutral,"

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/blood-pressure-drugs-and-ed-what-you-need-to-know," However, other BP drugs, such as alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angioten-sin-receptor blockers, rarely cause ED. Some research even suggests the effect of blood pressure drugs may be more psychological than physical. When ED occurs after a man begins to take a new medication, it's possible that anxiety about his health, rather than the medication, may trigger the problem. And being aware of possible side effects may make a man more likely to recognize them as abnormal. According to Harvard Special Health Report Erectile Dysfunction, one study in the European Heart Journal looked at men newly diagnosed with heart disease, but without ED, who started treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol (Tenormin). Some of the study participants were told about the sexual side effect of the blood pressure drug, and ED was reported by almost one-third of the participants.",rarely cause ED,neutral,"

Methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. To study a relatively homogeneous population, patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were recruited: men aged 40 to 49 years, all married, with a newly diagnosed, never treated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥95 mm Hg) and without sexual dysfunction symptoms. Patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction or stroke, secondary hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, renal failure (serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL), diabetes mellitus, or any relevant chronic disease were excluded from the study. All patients gave their informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee.The study design consisted of a 4-week run-in period on placebo, followed by a 16-week active treatment period, during which the patients were randomly treated daily with 20 mg lisinopril or 100 mg atenolol.

ACE inhibitors do not seem to be associated with erectile dysfunction (Nicolai, 2014). ARBs
ARB stands for angiotensin II receptor blockers. On the surface, that might sound pretty similar to ACE inhibitors, but they work differently. ACE inhibitors decrease the amount of angiotensin II in the body, while ARBs work by blocking angiotensin II from attaching to receptors on cells (Barreras, 2003). Remember that angiotensin raises blood pressure, so blocking the receptor for that hormone lowers blood pressure.

Is morphine addictive?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00082/full," Some groups demonstrated that preconditioning with morphine alleviated cerebral ischemia injury through activating the mTOR pathway (Arabian et al., 2018b) or mitochondrial KATP channels (Arabian et al., 2018a). However, repeated use of morphine will lead to various side-effects, such as antinociceptive tolerance, dependence, and addiction.Morphine AddictionLong-term treatment with morphine for the management of chronic pain will result in tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine. In order to overcome tolerance, a higher dose of morphine is often required for the maintenance of analgesia, which will result in the development of severe side-effects, including respiratory depression, withdrawal symptoms, and rewarding effects with a high risk of relapse (Eidson and Murphy, 2019). Morphine addiction has become a major public health issue. An increasing number of studies have revealed that several brain regions, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hippocampus (Hipp), are involved in morphine addiction (Kim et al., 2016). Although mechanisms underlying morphine-mediated processes remain the subject of much debate, morphine stimulation activates G protein-coupled opioid receptors and then induces significant molecular changes inside the cell, such as an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and activation of potassium channels (Qu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019).",Morphine addiction,yes,"

Is morphine addictive?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353755/," Although some studies suggest that the addictive potential of morphine decreases when it is used to treat neuropathic pain, this has not been studied in a SCI model. Accordingly, the present studies investigated the addictive potential of morphine in a rodent model of SCI using conditioned place preference (CPP) and intravenous self-administration paradigms. A contusion injury significantly increased the expression of a CPP relative to sham and intact controls in the acute phase of injury. However, contused animals self-administered significantly less morphine than sham and intact controls, but this was dose-dependent; at a high concentration, injured rats exhibited an increase in drug-reinforced responses over time.

Morphine addiction
Description
Morphine is an alkaloid from the plant extracts of opium poppy. Although morphine is highly effective for the treatment of pain, it is also known to be intensely addictive. We now know that the most important brain-reward circuit involves dopamine (DA) -containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and their target areas in the limbic forebrain, in particular, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and frontal regions of cerebral cortex. Morphine can cause indirect excitation of VTA dopamine neurons by reducing inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABAergic neurons. The chronic use of morphine is characterized by adaptive changes in neurons and neuronal communication; such adaptations (e.g., 'superactivation' of adenylyl cyclase) must underlie altered behaviour associated with morphine dependence and withdrawal syndrome, as well as drug-induced craving and relapse to drug use.",it is also known to be intensely addictive,neutral,"

"
Is morphine addictive?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/morphine-treatment/how-addictive," As morphine is taken or abused consistently, these changes become more ingrained. Morphine may become the main way a person is able to feel pleasure; thus, a dependence may form. From Abuse and Dependence to Addiction
Not everyone who develops a dependence on morphine may become addicted to it, but it is highly likely. When someone uses a drug for recreational purposes (i.e., beyond the scope of a legitimate prescription), the risk for becoming addicted to the drug increases. Injecting, snorting, or smoking morphine sends the drug rapidly across the barrier between the brain and blood, and circumvents any extended-release properties, sending the entire dosage into the bloodstream at once. Not only does this raise the risk for a potentially fatal overdose from suppressed respiration rates, it also may lead more quickly to dependence and addiction.",it is highly likely,neutral,"
yes
"
Is morphine addictive?,https://www.ashleytreatment.org/morphine-addiction-effects/," Consequences of morphine addiction
Morphine addiction occurs after a chemical dependence has formed — although not everyone with morphine dependence will go on to develop addiction. Abusing morphine recreationally, such as by snorting, smoking, or injecting the drug, increases the risk of addiction and overdose. Addiction to morphine involves compulsive use of the drug that leads to numerous consequences, impacting physical, mental and behavioral aspects of one’s life. Once addicted to it, the individual will experience harsh withdrawal effects when the morphine wears off. These include:

Nausea
Vomiting
Stomach cramps
Chills
Excessive yawning
Excessive tearing of the eyes
Dizziness
Sweating
Loss of appetite
Muscle aches
Irritability

FuerstJuice is good food and does not contribute to disruption of glucose-insulin homeostasis, as long as its 100% real fruit juice, according to a new study.A comprehensive data analysis suggests that 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, or insulin resistance, according to a new study.The findings are consistent with previous research indicating that 100% fruit juice is not associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and support a growing body of evidence that 100% fruit juice has no significant effect on glycemic control.Juice is good foodPure, 100% fruit juices can be nutrient-dense foods providing potassium, magnesium, folate, calcium, vitamins A and C, and soluble fiber, as well as an array of bioactive substances, including carotenoids and flavonoids. “Nutritional guidance encourages consumption of fruit as part of a balanced and healthy diet, although guidance often recommends limited consumption of fruit in the form of juice citing concerns over a lack of fiber and the potential for excessive energy intake. Juices also tend to have moderately high-glycemic index ratings, indicating a relatively rapid and high post-prandial glucose response as compared with foods with a lower glycemic index,” stated the researchers, led by Mary M. Murphy of the Center for Chemical Regulation & Food Safety in Washington, DC.Diets lower in these types of simple carbohydrates may be relevant for the prevention and management of some chronic diseases, including type 2 DM.The researchers published their results online December 15, 2017 in Journal of Nutritional Science.A systematic review quantitatively summarized results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of 100% fruit juice on glucose–insulin homeostasis. Using data from 18 RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (16 studies), fasting blood insulin (11 studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 7 studies) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; 3 studies) between the 100% fruit juice intervention and control groups.The results show 100% fruit juice, as compared with the control group,  had no significant effect on:Fasting blood glucose (−0.13 mmol/L)Fasting blood insulin (−0.24 pmol/L)HOMA-IR (−0.22) or HbA1c (−0.001)Results from stratified analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100% fruit juice and the measures of glucose control.“The available RCT indicate that repeated intake of 100% fruit juice does not have a significant effect on glycemic control or measures of insulin resistance,” the researchers stated.",not associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus,neutral,"

H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, MA and Fudan University in Shanghai, China, suggests that all sugary drinks, including natural fruit juices and artificially sweetened beverages, could increase diabetes risk.However, the study, which appears in the journal Diabetes Care, also offers some hope. It notes that people can decrease this risk by replacing sugary drinks of any kind with non-sweetened beverages, such as water, tea, and coffee.“The study provides further evidence demonstrating the health benefits associated with decreasing sugary beverage consumption and replacing these drinks with healthier alternatives like water, coffee, or tea.”First author Jean-Philippe Drouin-Chartier, Ph.D.Sugary drinks linked to 16% increase in riskDrouin-Chartier and colleagues analyzed data collected over 22–26 years from 76,531 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study between 1986–2012, 81,597 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II between 1991–2013, and 34,224 men from the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study, enrolled between 1986–2012.The researchers gave the participants questionnaires that asked them how often they consumed certain foods and beverages. By analyzing the results, the study authors found out how often participants drank certain sugary drinks and were able to calculate any changes in their drink consumption patterns.The researchers found that people who increased their total intake of soft drinks with added sugars and naturally sweet fruit drinks by over 4 ounces (oz) per day over 4 years saw an associated diabetes risk increase of 16% over the following 4 years.However, those who increased their total intake of artificially sweetened beverages — such as diet soda — by the same quantity over the same period saw an associated 18% increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.These associations remained in place even after the researchers adjusted for confounding variables, including body mass index (BMI), different dietary changes, and relevant lifestyle habits.The investigators caution, however, that the finding regarding artificially sweetened beverages may be unreliable because it remains unclear which way the association runs. They explain that people who know that they are already at high risk of developing diabetes may switch from sugary drinks to diet sodas to try and mitigate that risk.Moreover, the study authors also point out the risk of surveillance bias in their research. This refers to the fact that people who are at high risk of developing diabetes are more likely to undergo screenings for diabetes, therefore receiving a diagnosis sooner than other individuals.Overall, the research suggests that people might want to consider caution about their intake of sweet drinks of all kinds.",could increase diabetes risk,neutral,"

Juice consumption led to an 8 percent increase.“Fluids pass through the stomach to the intestine more rapidly than solids, even if nutritional content is similar. For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole fruits,” said Qi Sun, one of the study’s authors.Sysy Morales, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for 23 years, cautioned readers about the new study on her blog Diabetes Daily.She noted the metrics were taken on participants’ blood sugar levels after they had fasted. She said the participants were healthy and should show normal blood sugar levels after fasting.She added the study does seem legitimate, but she noted that the sugar in even “natural” fruit juice is still fructose.The American Diabetes Association agrees with Morales.“This meta-analysis examined 16 studies, none of which included people with diabetes, and none of which measured blood glucose levels soon after consuming juice — only fasting blood glucose levels,” the organization said in its statement.Defending the researchDespite the criticism, Murphy defends her team’s research. “These results are suggesting a very neutral effect in the diet, which is consistent with other research,” said Murphy.Murphy argues that there are still plenty of individuals who would benefit from 100 percent fruit juice.“We would never encourage individuals to get all of their fruit servings from juice, but certainly many people fall short of their fruit and vegetable servings, and 100 percent juices may be a way to help reach that 100 percent of that recommended intake,” she said.Research that is “industry funded” has been the target of consumer groups in recent years.A major study funded by cranberry giant Ocean Spray in 2016 about the benefits of cranberry juice consumption to treat urinary tract infections was called out by members of the media as “smoke and mirrors.”Ocean Spray continues to fund research and, in a subsequent interview with Healthline, stood by their work, as well as pledged to continue investigating the health benefits of cranberries.However, Murphy said not all industry research is the same. “Funding source isn’t synonymous with quality of a study,” she said.“Good quality studies can be funded by industry.",Juice consumption led to an 8 percent increase,neutral,"

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.thespikeapp.com/blog/can-i-drink-fruit-juice," · Diabetes,Type 1 Diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes,Carbohydrates,Blood SugarFruit juice contains a large amount of sugar which raises blood sugar levels very quickly. Therefore, people with diabetes are usually best to avoid drinking fruit juice.As a general rule, eating whole fruit is healthier than drinking fruit juice or fruit smoothies.Once regarded as a healthy drink, recent research indicates that that regular consumption of fruit juice may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What's in fruit juice? Aside from vitamin C and calcium, fruit juice contains:Calories - 250ml glass of unsweetened orange juice typically contains around 100 calories, compared to the 60 calories in an actual orangeFructose (a form of sugar) - half a pint of fruit juice contains more sugar than the World Health Organization recommends ideally having in a day (30g of sugar for men, 24g for women)A lack of fiber - juice always contains less fiber than whole fruit and highly processed juices may not contain any fiber How does fruit juice affect blood sugar? Sugar levels in fruit juice can cause a significant spike in blood sugar levels, increasing the risk of hyperglycemia (too high blood sugar levels).The glycemic index, which is used to reflect the impact on blood sugar levels of individual foods, places orange juice between 66 and 76 on a scale of 100. This makes fruit juice a high GI drink and high GI foods and drinks are best avoided by people with diabetes under most circumstances.One situation in which fruit juice can be useful is to raise blood sugar quickly in response to hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar).",regular consumption of fruit juice may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,yes,"

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://defeatdiabetes.org/resources/healthful-eating/healthy-beverages/fruit-juice/," Fruit juices can still be loaded with many important micronutrients, especially vitamins and minerals, that are not broken down during the process of juicing, and this is especially true when blended from whole fruits. However, though fresh fruit juices with no added sugar are certainly recommendable in comparison to sugary drinks like sodas and packaged and processed fruit beverages with added sugar or made from concentrate, the main conclusions to take away from this post are that fruit juices overall have less fiber and a significantly higher glycemic load than the whole fruits they are derived from, and are often consumed in addition to solid foods, not in substitution. Therefore, their frequent consumption can potentially increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. For diabetics and those at high risk for developing diabetes, as well as individuals looking to maintain overall health, eating whole fresh fruits, and drinking healthful beverages like water and unsweetened coffee and tea, are the best options for regulating blood glucose levels and maintaining a healthy weight.Resources and Further Reading2013 study revealing many aspects of why fruit juices increase risk of developing diabetes as opposed to whole fruits: http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001A study about sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juices and sodas and incidence of type 2 diabetes: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/3/517.longA guide that gives some solid recommendations on diabetes prevention, including limiting fruit juice intake and explanations about glycemic index and load: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#referencesGlycemic and Glycemic Load guide from Harvard: https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foodsSugar-sweetened beverages such as packaged and processed fruit juice, and diabetes incidence in African American women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663160?dopt=Citation

People who ate at least two servings each week of certain whole fruits — particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples — reduced their risk for type 2 diabetes by as much as 23% in comparison to those who ate less than one serving per month. Conversely, those who consumed one or more servings of fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 21%. The researchers found that swapping three servings of juice per week for whole fruits would result in a 7% reduction in diabetes risk. The fruits’ glycemic index (a measure of how rapidly carbohydrates in a food boost blood sugar) did not prove to be a significant factor in determining a fruit’s association with type 2 diabetes risk.

100% fruit juice was not associated with risk for prediabetes or significant effects on glucose metabolism markers such as fasting glucose and insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and HbA1C in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort.39An analysis of over 54,000 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study reported that the intake of total flavonoids was associated with lower risk for incident diabetes, likely mediated by decreased body fat in those who had the highest intake of flavonoids. A sub-analysis found that 100% orange juice had no adverse impact on the risk for incident diabetes.38
Orange Juice and Blood Glucose Levels
In recent years, studies around 100% orange juice and blood glucose levels have demonstrated a decreased fasting glucose (in men) following consumption,19 or no effect on blood glucose or insulin.20,21,31 A recent study in overweight and obese adults at risk for diabetes showed that 100% orange juice was not different than water on blood glucose or insulin responses when consumed with a meal, even though the orange juice group consumed higher total carbohydrates.32 Even adults drinking high amounts of 100% orange juice (20 to 25 ounces daily) beyond what is recommended for two to three months had no changes in markers of glucose metabolism.22,23 Furthermore, in a cross-over intervention study, consumption of soda resulted in a higher daylong glycemia, higher blood glucose variability, and lower insulin secretion compared to 100% orange juice even though the beverages were matched for sugar content. This study suggests glucose metabolism is different with added-sugar beverages than with 100% orange juice.33 A small acute study in healthy young women reported no difference in glucose or insulin response when comparing consumption of raw oranges with 100% orange juice or 100% orange juice sweetened naturally with nectar (all matched for total sugars), suggesting that orange juice had no differential glucose or insulin response compared to whole fruit.34
Orange Juice Compared to Other Beverages
Additionally, 100% orange juice may have a distinct advantage over sugary beverages. For example, two independent clinical studies comparing 100% orange juice to a glucose drink or water consumed alongside a high-fat/high carbohydrate meal noted more gradual rises in blood glucose and insulin with orange juice when compared to sugary water.24-25
A cohort modeling study found that substituting 100% fruit juice for sugar sweetened beverages resulted in a significant decreased risk for several cardiometabolic markers, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Modeling a substitution of 100% juice for whole fruit did not result in adverse impacts on any cardiometabolic risk factor. These results suggest that although 100% fruit juice and sugar sweetened beverages have similar sugar content, they are not comparable with regard to cardiometabolic risk and that 100% fruit juice and fruit may be comparable regarding their impacts on cardiometabolic risk.36
Orange Juice and Insulin Sensitivity
100% orange juice has also been shown to have no adverse effect on insulin sensitivity in clinical studies with various participants who were at higher risk of diabetes:
Overweight men with elevated cholesterol consuming 250mL (~8oz) of 100% orange juice daily for 12 weeks demonstrated no adverse effects on measures of insulin sensitivity, body composition, or other indices of metabolic syndrome.26Obese adults on a reduced-calorie diet and consuming 500 mL of orange juice daily for three months had HOMA-IR(insulin sensitivity), blood glucose, insulin, and blood lipids either improve or stay within healthy ranges while not hindering weight loss.27Obese children consuming 250 mL of mandarin juice twice a day for four weeks supplementing a hypo caloric diet demonstrated decreased insulin levels and HOMA-IR, which was not observed in the control group.28HOMA-IR was not significantly different in healthy young women immediately following consumption of whole oranges or 100% orange juice (matched for total sugars).",did not increase the risk of diabetes,neutral,"

Fructose from whole fruit doesn’t add to your intake of free (or added) sugar, but in fruit juice or a smoothie it does.What is free (added) sugar?Free (added) sugar includes the sugars added to foods by manufacturers, eg in cakes, chocolates, jam, some pasta sauces, fizzy drinks and breakfast cereals. It also includes the sugar found in fruit juices, smoothies and honey.A recent report by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), stated that we need to reduce our intake of free (added) sugars by half.The report recommends that we should consume no more than 5 per cent of our energy from free sugar. This means the maximum daily intake of free (added) sugar should be:19g, equal to 5 cubes or 5 tsp of sugar, for children (aged 4 to 7)24g, equal to 6 cubes or 6 tsp of sugar, for children aged (7 to 10)30g, equal to 7 cubes or 7 tsp of sugar, for children (over 11) and adultsEating too much free (added) sugar contributes towards obesity, tooth decay and also puts people at risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps fail to help rheumatoid arthritis, says York research
Posted on 16 September 2013
Copper bracelets and magnet wrist straps have no real effect on pain, swelling, or disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis, according to new findings from a study conducted at the University of York. In the first randomised controlled trial to study the effects of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps on rheumatoid arthritis, 70 patients with active symptoms each wore four different devices over a five-month period, reporting on their pain, disability, and medication use throughout the study. Participants also provided blood samples, after wearing each device for five weeks, in order to monitor changes in inflammation. What these findings do tell us is that people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness
Dr Stewart Richmond

The research published in PLOS ONE, show that both the standard magnetic wrist strap and the copper bracelet provided no meaningful therapeutic effects beyond those of a placebo, which was not magnetic and did not contain copper. Dr Stewart Richmond, a Research Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study, said: “It’s a shame that these devices don’t seem to have any genuine benefit. They’re so simple and generally safe to use.",fail to help rheumatoid arthritis,no,"

Do magnetic wrist straps help with arthritis?,https://japractice.co.uk/2016/02/do-copper-bracelets-help-with-arthritis/11866," There was not. The trial adds to a previous disappointment about the benefits of wearing metals in this way. A previous study looked at magnetic bracelets. It was the single randomised, placebo-controlled trial on the use of magnet therapy for rheumatoid arthritis that had been conducted before the new experiment on different kinds of bracelet. Dr. Stewart Richmond, who also led the 2013 study from the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York, wrote in the published paper for magnetic bracelets: “The results of this trial, which compared strong versus weak magnets strapped to the knee, showed that there was no statistical difference in pain outcomes between experimental and control groups.”
And about the latest findings from comparing copper-only, magnetic and placebo bracelets, Dr. Richmond writes: “It’s a shame that these devices don’t seem to have any genuine benefit. They’re so simple and generally safe to use.”
But he goes on to say that “people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness.”
Using copper bracelets for pain relief
When we see the sales descriptions for copper bracelets, sold within a wider industry for magnetic wristbands estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, we find that the information is often:

Impressive – “worn for healing by mankind for centuries” or “made from the finest pure copper”
Accurate – “copper is essential for our bodies” or “the metal has a natural ability to conduct heat.”

Researchers conducted the first randomised placebo-controlled trial on the use of both copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps for pain management in osteoarthritis – the most common form of the condition. The devices are used worldwide for helping to manage pain associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. The results of this trial conflict with those from previous studies, by showing that both magnetic and copper bracelets were ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine.",ineffective,no,"

Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/want-a-stronger-core-skip-the-sit-ups," Now plank exercises, in which you assume a position and hold it, are the gold standard for working your core, while classic sit-ups and crunches have fallen out of favor. Why the shift? One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back - they push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort. Second, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles. Finally, activities of daily living, as well as sports and recreational activities, call on your muscles to work together, not in isolation.",sit-ups are hard on your back,yes,"

From celebrity trainers working in the trendiest Manhattan gyms to the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis and the US Army training exams, sit-ups are developing a bad reputation. Scientists have discovered that the moves, once a staple of basic workout routines, don't reduce waistline circumference or trim belly fat. Sit-ups are also not the best way to strengthen your core or to keep it flexible and strong for the long run.Last week, the US Army announced that after decades of requiring two-minute sit-up tests, it would phase out that portion of its fitness test by the end of 2020. Instead, the Army says it'll make room for some fitness tasks found to be more useful for soldiers' combat readiness, like deadlifts, power throws, and drag-and-carry moves, The Washington Times reported.It's a change that Tony Maloney, a trainer and exercise physiologist at the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, can get behind.

Avoiding spine flexion is not necessary for everyone; it really depends on how you spend the rest of your days. If you are like the majority of people out there sitting at a computer all day, you are constantly sitting in a flexed position. So for someone like this the last thing we want them to do is go exercise by sitting or flexing the spine even more. Now if you are an individual who stands all day or spends most of the day on your feet then flexion type exercises may not be so bad, and in fact may be encouraged. Top 4 tips for getting started

He gave the example of belly dancers, whose movements he has studied: They flex their spines repetitively without high incidence of injury. “The problem occurs when you flex over and over again with load from higher muscle activation or external objects held in the hands.”If you’ve ever been told to lift with your legs, this is why. When a person’s spine curves and strains in order to move weight through space—like when a bunch of third graders flail through a set of sit-ups—the movement stresses their spinal disks.

Do they give you a taut six-pack across your abdomen or does a flat stomach depend more on diet and general exercise than a specific routine? A review of all the research conducted on sit-ups reports evidence that they do improve flexibility and muscle strength and that in dogs flexing the spine has been shown to help the delivery of nutrients to the discs which could prevent stiffness.So far, so good. But to get the desired six-pack does take an awful lot of work. In a small randomised controlled trial in Illinois in 2011 one group did daily abdominal exercises while the lucky control group did none. After six weeks detailed measurements were taken and it was found that the sit-ups made no difference to waist size or the amount of fat around their stomachs.Some people may be genetically predisposed to suffer back pain from sit-ups (Credit: Getty Images)Many sportspeople do sit-ups as part of a raft of exercises which aim to improve their core stability, but research from Thomas Nesser from Indiana State University suggests that improving your core stability doesn’t necessarily result in better athletic performance.Whether or not they provide you with precisely the physique or fitness you desire, could sit-ups bring unintended consequences such as back pain?",whether they might even be bad for you,neutral,"

 Why Sit Ups Might be Bad for Your Low Back			 June 20, 2019/in Uncategorized /by Dennis McGee, DCMany of our patients are surprised to learn that sit ups can be bad for the low back. Sit ups and crunches are a common exercise done to strengthen the abdominal muscles, but researchers tell us that sit ups can damage the lumbar discs and they can even strengthen the wrong muscles.

During a sit up, the lumbar spine bends forward. This forward bending causes increased compression on the lumbar discs. The typical sit up creates about 700 pounds of compressive force on the intervertebral disc.

Sit-ups strengthen your core, which will pay dividends in your day-to-day life. For instance, the core strength you develop from regular sit-ups will help you develop a healthy posture. Good posture requires that the muscles around your spine be balanced and strong to provide equal support to your body — this state is known as “neutral spine position.” Good posture isn’t just attractive; it’s necessary for good health. The benefits of good posture are:

Reduced lower back pain
Fewer tension headaches
Increased energy
Better neck and shoulder health
Lower risk of uneven wear on your joints
Increased lung capacity 
Improved circulation and digestion
Reduced jaw pain
Better form during your workouts

In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality.

Their stuttering was directly connected to being forced to change writing hands at a young age
It had a dramatic negative effect on them, often lasting their whole lives
In some case at least, once they changed back to writing left-handed their stuttering stopped

Now this is only anecdotal evidence but it is pretty clear! There has been research over the years that has found the percentage of stutterers who are left handed is much higher than the general population but that was not specifically linked to forced hand change (and would depend whether the people who had been changed were still classed as “left-handers” in the research!). There was also one piece of research as far back as 1940 that actually indicated that lefthanders were LESS likely to be stutterers (but again definitions can cause a problem as the lefthanders who were   forced to change and then stuttered may well have been counted as right-handers!). We have not been able to find any solid research about this and on the British Stammering Association website it is not mentioned apart from very briefly in a couple of contributed articles, again with no actual research background.",definitions can cause a problem,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.press.jhu.edu/newsroom/stuttering-and-retraining-left-handed-children-mid-century-us," All 16 had reverted to writing with their natural hand and, according to the authors, their stuttering either ceased or was substantially ameliorated. Other researchers, including Orton, reported similar findings. Reviewing the past two decades of research on “the study of handedness and its relation to speech,” renowned London neurologist W. Russell Brain (1885–1966) reported in The Lancet in 1945 that “there is considerable evidence correlating stuttering with anomalies of handedness.”
Although most experts no longer see a direct cause and effect between hand switching and stuttering, they nevertheless oppose forcing left-handers to convert to right-handed writing. Despite the “early and impressive statistical reports” psychologist Lauren Julius Harris, writing in 1990, concluded that the evidence that retraining caused stuttering was weak. Still, he admitted that we “know little more on this question [than] in the 1930s” because studies since then “have ignored the question of hand training and have focused on the broader question of whether speech disorders are more common in left-handers generally.”
I hope my forthcoming book will reawaken interest in determining whether there is a link between left-handedness and stuttering, not least of all because, unlike in the U.S. and Europe, most of the planet’s left-handers remain subjected to discrimination and retraining.

From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness.",stuttering,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_against_left-handed_people," A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary. [11]

Forced use of the right hand[edit]
Owing to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including learning disorders, dyslexia,[12] stuttering[13][14][15] and other speech disorders. [16] Shifts from left- to right-handed are more likely to be successful than right to left, though neither have a high success rate. Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones. [17] Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere.",stuttering[13][14][15] and other speech disorders,neutral,"

spatial disorientation (uncertainty concerning the left and right)
disorders in fine motor skills that manifest themselves in handwriting
disturbances in speech (ranging from stammering through stuttering)

These primary consequences can then transform into various differing secondary consequences:

inferiority complexes
insecurity
introversion
overcompensation through heightened performance
contrariness; an oppositional and provocational manner; (e.g. the class clown in school; and the persistent, compulsive wise-cracker in adulthood)
various distinctive disorders in behavior
bedwetting and nail-biting
emotional problems lasting into adulthood with neurotic and/or psycho-somatic symptomology
disorders in the personality profile

Of course, all of the primary and secondary difficulties listed above could also appear without the converting of handedness and they are just as prevalent in left-handers as in right-handers. However, as has been found in practice, through the additional converting of handedness these difficulties, are incalculably increased. Thus, the converting of handedness negatively intervenes into and inhibits the course of the cerebral processes. It drives people to continually use more energy to mobilize their intelligence than left-handed or right-handed people who have not been disabled by the consequences of converting would find necessary. The level of intelligence itself is not diminished.",they are just as prevalent in left-handers,neutral,"

Another difficulty for researchers is that handedness isn’t always cut and dried. While some people use one hand exclusively for all tasks, others tend to swap depending on the activity; for example, some people write with their left hand but open jars with their right. It was once believed that a right-handed person has general dominance on the right side of their body, which means their favoured foot, eye and ear are also on their right side.

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/9/3271," The location found in our study suggests that forced preference for right-hand writing had greatest impact on the striatal territory that provides an interface between executive and cognitive control of skilled movements. We argue that a forced switch of handedness represents an early and persistent environmental modulator of maturation of the basal ganglia, which itself is genetically determined and only complete in the third decade of life (Steen et al., 1997; Sowell et al., 1999; Snook et al., 2005). Morphometric studies in children aged 7–16 have described a substantial loss of striatal and pallidal volume during normal development (Sowell et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2000), likely because of pruning processes. Studies in genetically caused disorders found a relative size increase of these structures compared with controls (Binkofski et al., 2007; Gothelf et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning in the territory of the putamen that integrates executive and cognitive aspects of motor control. In converted left-handers, individual variations in the volume of the left midputamen correlate with the acquired dexterity of handwriting.",environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning,neutral,"

Famous lefty super geniuses include Albert Einstein, Aristotle, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin and Sir Isaac Newton, according to lefthandersday.com . Some suggest that “left-handed genius” stems from being forced to use both sides of the brain more often, allowing lefties to process large amounts of information more readily, according to anythinglefthanded.co.uk , but the evidence to support that claim is largely contradictory. In fact, the most recent study by Joshua Goodman, an associate professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, found lefties scored about 10 to 12 percent less than righties on “measures of cognitive skill”, even after controlling for health as babies and family background.5 (Several studies in the 1970s and 80s linked birth stress to handedness, but more recent reports are less conclusive.) Looking at five large studies of individuals in the U.S. and United Kingdom, and data on education and employment, Goodman further found lefties also had more behavioral and speech problems and were more likely to have learning disabilities.

Dehydrated individuals can quickly reach excessive levels of sodium in their urine. Thus, by drinking urine you will be consuming even more sodium, and higher levels of sodium in your body quickly lead to feeling thirstier. Conclusion: drinking urine in these circumstances is a bad idea as your body quickly develops a negative feedback loop in which, despite drinking fluids, you feel thirstier.To summarize:Drinking urine will not improve a person’s health. In some cases, it may even worsen health issues.Anyone seeking natural remedies should consult a doctor or another healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about the subject.When access to water is scarce, it is important to seek a healthy source, such as clear rainwater, condensation, or water in food, especially water-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables.Drinking urine may make dehydration worse and intensify any side effects.

The study, published in the medical journal Cogent Medicine, looked specifically at the effects of fascia manipulation on cellulite in adult women. Fascial manipulation is a type of manual massage treatment typically employed for pain relief, according to Northern Edge Physical Therapy. In certain cases, the vigorous nature of fascia manipulation can cause bruising and injury, and FasciaBlaster has faced lawsuits as a result.Advertisement

Can massage get rid of cellulite?,https://www.lipotherapeia.com/the-peach-factor-blog/cellulite-massage," And, of course, working on muscles is totally pointless for our purposes.What cellulite massage can offer and what it can’tMany types of massage can indeed boost circulation and lymphatic drainage and consequently partially help PREVENT low-grade inflammation, fibrosis and some fat accumulation too.A real cellulite massage can additionally REDUCE fibrosis, low-grade chronic inflammation and to some extent also help boost skin firmness.But no cellulite massage can really reduce cellulite fat.So massage has its limitations, especially in relation to technology-based treatments, such as deep-acting, high-power radiofrequency/ultrasound cavitation.But for those who do not have access to such treatments, who do no want to pay the higher cost or who simply do not like technology-based treatments, a good cellulite massage can play an important role in cellulite prevention and reduction.Deep tissue massage for celluliteAnd since we mentioned working on muscles and deep fascia, let’s talk about deep tissue massage first. Deep tissue massage, also known as remedial massage or sports massage, works on muscles and deep fascia. These are the tissues where all the techniques used for deep tissue massage aim to affect, in order to restore balance on the musculoskeletal system.Because deep tissue massage is supposed to be a stronger type of massage, as opposed to the swedish/relaxation variety, people think that it can help cellulite too - at least more than swedish massage.Even though by working with a lot of pressure on muscles does somewhat affect the hypodermis, it still is not specific enough to offer any good results with cellulite, so deep tissue massage is not an effective cellulite technique.Great for the muscles and overall circulation/lymphatic drainage, not that amazing for cellulite.Swedish massage for celluliteSwedish massage is just too light to have even any half-decent effect on cellulite.Swedish massage is:great for mental relaxation for some people (and highly irritating for people who like deeper massage)kinda helpful for muscular relaxationdecently helpful for circulation improvementbut really pointless for cellulite.Clearly a much more vigorous and specific treatment is needed.Thai massage for celluliteThai massage is based on point pressures and stretching.The point pressures are just too “pointy” to affect the entire cellulite surface. Also they are not specific to the hypodermis either.The stretches are nice for the muscles but wouldn’t do anything for cellulite.And both point pressures and stretches would boost circulation to a small extent, but not to a large extent, and neither in any specific way to affect cellulite.So, all in all, Thai massage may be an overall nice type of bodywork/massage for mental and muscular relaxation, but not for cellulite removal. (MLD) Manual lymphatic drainage massage for celluliteLymphatic drainage massage is the elephant in the room when it comes to cellulite massages. Mention cellulite massage and everyone thinks ‘lymphatic massage’.But is all the hype justified?Three-four decades ago in continental Europe, and twenty years ago here in the UK, the only game in town when it came to cellulite massage was lymphatic massage:partly because that’s people believed that “cellulite is all toxins and water retention, you know”partly due to the unjustified cure-all, legend status manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) has attained among manual therapistsAnd partly because to some extent it does help cellulite - the keyphrase here being “to some extent”Manual lymph massage does help boost circulation and lymphatic drainage in people with lymphoedema (clinical water retention) better than any other technique, simply because these people need that special type of massage.But for the vast majority of the population who do not have clinical problems with water retention, the circulation boosting / lymphatic drainage that MLD offers can also be offered equally effectively even with the most rudimentary massage, including swedish and deep tissue.It can also be achieved with mechanical massage, such as pressotherapy.",no cellulite massage can really reduce cellulite fat,yes,"

The suctioning maneuvers break up the fat deposits while the massage strokes push the fat deposits and retained water through the body so they can be eliminated by the lymphatic system, helping the body get rid of both excess fat and liquids. As lymphatic drainage massage affects the more superficial tissues that cause cellulite, the result is a smoother, more even skin tone in the areas where a client has cellulite. The strokes used in Miracle Sculpt are unique in that they use a suctioning and massage strokes together to not only reduce inflammation and bloating but also break up fat deposits, significantly reducing the appearance of cellulite.

Research Report


Cannabis (Marijuana) Research Report
Is marijuana addictive? Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. Recent data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of marijuana use disorder.18 People who begin using marijuana before the age of 18 are four to seven times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder than adults.19
Marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence—in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. People who use marijuana frequently often report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness, and/or various forms of physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to 2 weeks.20,21 Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.22,23
Marijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the person cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted. Those studies suggest that 9% of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it,24,25 rising to about 17% in those who start using in their teens.26,27
In 2015, about 4.0 million people in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder;3 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment for their marijuana use.28

Can you become addicted to weed?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/marijuana-rehab/is-it-addictive," Yes, marijuana can be addictive.8 Although not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it, it is possible to develop a marijuana addiction or a cannabis use disorder. In 2020, approximately 14.2 million people aged 12 or older met the diagnostic criteria for a cannabis use disorder within the past year.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder, with a higher risk for people who begin using marijuana before the age of 18.5,7 Marijuana accounts for nearly half of admissions into substance use treatment for youth between the ages of 12 to 17.7
An individual who regularly uses marijuana may develop a cannabis use disorder, where cannabis use becomes uncontrollable and begins to impact normal functioning, such as failure to fulfill role responsibilities at home or work, physical dependence, and health problems.9
Cannabis use disorder can range from mild, to moderate, to severe. Severe forms of cannabis use disorder are often referred to as marijuana/cannabis addiction due to compulsive drug use behavior despite the negative impact it has on aspects of an individual’s life, including significant impairment across life domains—like interpersonal relationships, work and/or school performance, and negative effects on psychological and physical health.8,9
Withdrawal symptoms, an indicator of physiological dependence, can occur when an individual who has used cannabis frequently—such as daily or almost daily—abruptly stops using cannabis or significantly reduces their use.9 Withdrawal from marijuana can cause significant discomfort and distress, which may lead the person to return to marijuana use to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.9
 

Why Is Marijuana Addictive? Chronic cannabis use is associated with physiological changes in the brain that may contribute to the continued use of marijuana. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, appears to be responsible for marijuana’s reinforcing properties and a primary contributor to marijuana addiction.10,11 Results from empirical studies have shown that THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. Alterations in dopamine signaling or levels of dopamine are generally associated with other drugs of addiction.10
Signs of Marijuana Abuse and Addiction
Signs that a loved one might be using marijuana may include changes to their overall demeanor—such as being unusually giggly or uncoordinated—finding it hard to remember things that just happened, or finding marijuana-related paraphernalia like pipes, rolling papers, and vape pens in their possessions.7,12

While marijuana is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States, many people have the same question: Is marijuana addictive? The answer is yes, it can be. However, that doesn't mean everyone who uses the substance will become addicted. Most people who use marijuana do not become addicted to weed.

For some, marijuana use poses a substantial likelihood of developing an addiction.The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently released data that suggests that 30 percent of those who use marijuana may have some degree of “marijuana use disorder.”They add that people who use marijuana before age 18 are 4 to 7 times more likely to develop this use disorder than adults.Researchers estimated that 4 million people in the United States met the criteria for marijuana use disorder in 2015. Of them, 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment.The use disorder, according to researchers, can morph into an addiction when the person can’t stop using the drug even when it interferes with their daily activities.The Canyon, a treatment center in Malibu, California, lists 10 signs that someone might have an addiction to marijuana. Among the signals is a growing tolerance for the drug’s effects, as well as using more marijuana than they initially intended to use.Who becomes addicted to marijuana and why?Genes are one strong predictor of developing an addiction, said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California.Studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory. They have higher rates of an addiction co-occurring, which means that if one of them develops an addiction, the other is at greater risk for developing one, than fraternal twins raised apart.But family ties may also help some people avoid progressing to a state of addiction.“When we look at the criteria for addiction, it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior,” explained Carl Hart, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York and author of “High Price,” in a 2016 interview with Healthline. “It has a lot to do with responsibility skills… It’s not perfect, but when you look at the people who are addicted, and you look at people who have jobs and families, they have responsibilities, they’re plugged into their societies, they have a social network, the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs, families, social networks.”Those who don’t become addicted also tend to have more options.“Most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good,” said Gantt Galloway, PharmD, executive and research director of the New Leaf Treatment Center and senior scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, in a 2016 interview with Healthline.“Those who have fewer choices, who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships… those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction.”Mental health conditions, which have both genetic and environmental causes play a large one in a person’s chance of developing an addiction.“Mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction,” said Stalcup.",those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive,neutral,"

      The vegan diet
    
  






A vegan diet is based on plants (such as vegetables, grains, nuts and fruits) and foods made from plants.Vegans do not eat foods that come from animals, including dairy products and eggs. Healthy eating as a vegan
You can get the nutrients you need from eating a varied and balanced vegan diet including fortified foods and supplements. For a healthy vegan diet:eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every daybase meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates (choose wholegrain where possible)have some fortified dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options)eat some beans, pulses and other proteinseat nuts and seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids (such as walnuts) every daychoose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat in small amountshave fortified foods or supplements containing nutrients that are more difficult to get through a vegan diet, including vitamin D, vitamin B12, iodine, selenium, calcium and irondrink plenty of fluids (the government recommends 6 to 8 cups or glasses a day)If you choose to include foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar, have them less often and in small amounts.See The Eatwell Guide for more information about a healthy diet. The Eatwell Guide applies to vegetarians, vegans, people of all ethnic origins and those who are a healthy weight for their height, as well as those who are overweight.The only group The Eatwell Guide is not suitable for is children under the age of 2, as they have different needs.

One way in which this claim could be examined is by focusing on mortality differences between vegans and others. The problem, however, is that no studies exist of populations where omnivores share similar genetic profiles, similar lifestyle patterns, and similar social and environmental factors with a significant number of vegans. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies—that is, studies which compare, usually over a long time, those who remain healthy with those who become ill—from the UK, Germany, California, the USA, the Netherlands, and Japan, including 124,706 participants, compared vegetarians with omnivores and found that all-cause mortality was 9% lower amongst vegetarians (T.

Effects of avoiding dairyVegans also avoid dairy products, which some studies suggest may slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer (34).On the other hand, there is evidence that dairy may help reduce the risk of other cancers, such as colorectal cancer (35, 36). So, avoiding dairy may not be the factor that lowers vegans’ overall risk of cancer.It’s important to note that these studies are observational. They make it impossible to pinpoint the exact reason vegans have a lower risk of cancer.However, until researchers know more, it seems wise to focus on increasing the amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes you eat each day while limiting your consumption of processed, smoked, and overcooked meats.SummaryCertain aspects of the vegan diet may offer protection against several types of cancer, including prostate, breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers.A vegan diet is linked to a lower risk of heart diseaseEating fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and fiber is linked to a lower risk of heart disease (37, 38, 39).Well-planned vegan diets generally include all these foods in amounts higher than the standard Western diet.Observational studies comparing vegans with vegetarians and non-vegetarians report that vegans may benefit from up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure (40).Vegans may also have a lower risk of dying from heart disease, though more studies are needed to understand the relationship (40, 41).What’s more, several randomized controlled studies report that vegan diets are much more effective at reducing blood sugar, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels than the diets they are compared with (11, 12, 42).This may be particularly beneficial to heart health, since reducing high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels may reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 46% (43). A well-balanced vegan diet includes plenty of whole grains and nuts, both of which are good for your heart (44, 45).SummaryVegan diets may benefit heart health by significantly reducing the risk factors that contribute to heart disease.A vegan diet can reduce pain from arthritis A few studies have reported that a vegan diet has positive effects in people with different types of arthritis.One small study randomly assigned people with arthritis to either continue eating their omnivorous diet or switch to a whole food, plant-based vegan diet for 6 weeks (46).Those on the vegan diet reported higher energy levels and better general functioning than those who didn’t change their diet (46).Several other studies suggest a vegan diet may help improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including pain, joint swelling, and morning stiffness, but the relationship needs further investigation (47, 48).The vegan diet’s higher antioxidant, probiotic, and fiber content, as well as its lack of certain trigger foods, could be responsible for these benefits (47, 48).SummaryVegan diets based on antioxidant-rich whole foods may significantly decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Vegan recipe ideasNow that you’ve seen the potential benefits, you might be wondering how to add more plant-based meals to your rotation.

These chronic illnesses cost the UK around £9bn a year; veganism may be the solution.“There’s growing evidence that reduced consumption of animal products, coupled with an increase in plant-based foods, seems to be good for our health,” says Rogerson. “This is perhaps due to these foods containing lot of antioxidant phytonutrients and nitrates, while some animal products contain lots of pro-inflammatory fats and lead to the production of a metabolite called TMAO, which has been linked to cardiovascular problems.”The anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based foods is thought to be the reason why vegan diets appear to relieve symptoms of some auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Once more, the use of illegal skin lightening creams highlights the dangers of Hydroquinone

A recent study conducted by researchers working at the Medicines and Consumer Safety division of the Scientific Institute of Public Health and the Department of Toxicology and The Dermato-Cosmetology and Centre for Pharmaceutical Research in Brussels, Belgium, entitled “In vitro Dermal Absorption of Hydroquinone: Protocol Validation and Applicability on Illegal Skin-Whitening Cosmetics”, which was published in the Journal of Skin Pharmacology and Physiology in 2016, has highlighted the serious dangers of hydroquinone penetrating the blood stream by skin absorption with a cumulative toxic effect with daily applications. Hydroquinone is classified as a drug and is banned for the use in cosmetic products in Europe and in many countries such as Japan, Australia and several African states. Nevertheless, it is still too often found in formulations of depigmenting creams sold online all over the world. The main reason being, that sale of such creams represents a multi-billion dollar market. Sadly although HQ does depigment the skin, this ingredient poses a serious public health risk. Hydroquinone (HQ) is a substance which is naturally present in plants and foods such as coffee, cranberries, and blueberries for example, and which isn’t dangerous to consume when ingested occasionally and in small quantities with the foods we eat.",Hydroquinone is classified as a drug and is banned,neutral,"

The Concern About Hydroquinone New York dermatologist Jacob Levitt, MD explains that the main concern about over-the-counter hydroquinone is unmonitored overuse. “The concern is that this would lead to exogenous ochronosis, which is relatively rare but difficult to treat in darker skinned individuals.

This is particularly true for BIPOC patients, who are often disproportionately affected by dyschromia.With an FDA-approved formulation and inclusion on the Bulk Substances list for compounding, many experts feel it’s unlikely that the FDA will entirely remove hydroquinone from the U.S. market anytime soon. But the controversy surrounding the drug has spurred efforts to find safe and effective alternatives to treat hyperpigmentation.A Brief History of Hydroquinone1978: As the first step in creating an official monograph, an FDA advisory panel proposes recommendations for regulating skin bleaching products. Based on evidence presented, the panel suggests that hydroquinone be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) in concentrations of 1.5 percent to 2 percent and labeled to discontinue use after two months if no improvement is made.1982: After public comments, the FDA proposes a tentative final monograph (TFM). The agency rejects an appeal from industry to allow concentrations up to 4 percent hydroquinone based on study findings showing no significant difference in efficacy between 2 percent and 4 percent. The FDA agrees with the panel’s conclusion that high concentrations of hydroquinone with exposure to the sun may cause disfiguring effects.1999: The International Agency for Research and Cancer (IARC) determines that hydroquinone is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans due to inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.2001: The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone due to concerns about leukoderma-en-confetti and exogenous ochronosis.2006: Based on additional research and data, the FDA decides to reverse its recommendation and proposes to classify hydroquinone as not GRASE, effectively withdrawing the tentative final monograph for the skin bleaching category.",The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone,yes,"

In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned for use in skin lightening products since January 2001. Its use in skin lightening has been associated with leukoderma-en-confetti, a condition that is characterized by confetti like depigmented areas of the skin, and ochronosis. Prior to the ban, Hydroquinone was the most common ingredient in skin lighteners. However, its use was limited to localised areas of the skin such as age spots under the European Cosmetic Regulation. Eventually, it became evident that it was being used on larger areas and that its use was linked to the above conditions plus other possible health risks.

Clinical safety of hydroquinone
The banning of hydroquinone in over-the-counter products in Europe was due to the concerns of ochronosis and not due to the potential carcinogenic potential. The fear of hydroquinone causing permanent discolouration and ochronosis were the main reasons behind the ban. Ochronosis is caused by the over-application of the hydroquinone. It is the duration and the percentage of the hydroquinone used that determines the occurrence of ochronosis. Ochronosis was first reported by Findlay et al. in South African Bantu women who applied hydroquinone in high concentrations and for a long period of time.10 Most of the cases reported in the USA are from the use of 2% hydroquinone.11 Hydroquinone is a major metabolic by-product of benzene.",The banning of hydroquinone in over-the-counter products in Europe,yes,"

Considering the risks to human health associated with its application, hydroquinone has been banned from cosmetics in Europe since 2001 [40] and its use in skin-lightening cosmetic formulations is currently illegal (see the “Regulations” section for more details). Cosmetics containing hydroquinone have also been banned in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.Several researchers have focused their attention on the mechanisms of depigmentation produced by hydroquinone. It has been shown that hydroquinone inhibits the activity of the tyrosinase enzyme by blocking the oxidation of tyrosine to DOPA and the subsequent oxidation of DOPA, causing the cessation of melanin synthesis; hydroquinone treatment decreases the number of melanised melanosomes and leads to the formation of abnormally melanised melanosomes, which eventually die [42]. Recently, Aspengren et al.

During World War II, British Royal Air Force pilots first began using radar to target and shoot down enemy planes. In an effort to keep this new technology a secret, the visual accuracy of the pilots — especially at night — was attributed to eating carrots. This led to a longstanding propaganda campaign that promoted carrots for better eyesight.

To keep eyes healthy, include these foods in your diet. You likely grew up hearing that you should eat your carrots because they’re good for your eyes. It is true that carrots, as well as other orange-colored fruits and vegetables, can improve eye health thanks to the beta-carotene they contain. But they’re not the only foods you should eat to keep your eyes healthy. Other nutrients in addition to beta-carotene, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, zinc, vitamins C and E and omega-3 fatty acids, help protect your eyes, especially as you age.

High levels of formic acid cause a range of different effects including something called acidosis, where the acidity of your blood gets too high and a number of organs (like the kidney) begin to malfunction.

BackgroundMethanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is a volatile, colorless, flammable fluid [1]. It is also known as wood alcohol because it is distilled from wood. Methanol is considered highly toxic and is usually only used for industrial purposes. However, it is sometimes used as an inexpensive and illegal counterfeit alternative to ethanol, especially in countries where ethanol consumption is restricted. Homemade alcoholic beverages are consumed as cheaper and more cost-effective underground ethanol substitutes [2, 3].

AbstractMethanol ingestion is an uncommon form of poisoning that can cause severe metabolic disturbances, blindness, permanent neurologic dysfunction and death. While methanol itself may be harmless, it is converted in vivo to the highly toxic formic acid. The diagnosis is sometimes elusive and requires a high index of suspicion. Because antidotal treatment is available it is important to recognize methanol poisoning promptly. The presence of metabolic acidosis associated with an increased anion gap and increased osmol gap are important laboratory findings.","can cause severe metabolic disturbances, blindness, permanent neurologic dysfunction and death",neutral,"

Previous outbreaks of methanol poisoning in Iran in 2007, 2013 and 2018, resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.2–4 The most recent outbreak, and perhaps the most significant, coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. Our records show a dramatic increase in cases of methanol intoxication in March and April 2020; as of 16 April 2020, there have been 797 cases of methanol poisoning with 97 deaths in the Fars province, Iran, reported by the Head of Emergency Medical Service of the Fars province.5 These numbers, from a single province, supersede the previous largest report from the whole country (768 intoxicated subjects) in 2018,4 and there are similar reports of methanol poisonings in several other centres throughout the country during this period.Unlike prior outbreaks, the current outbreak of methanol poisoning appears to be due to the belief that consumption of disinfectants and sanitizers, specifically, alcohol, would be beneficial in preventing the COVID-19 infection. This is supported by several cases of methanol poisoning in children resulting from a desperate attempt by parents to prevent or cure the infection. When facing a serious health threat, refractory to the available remedies, such irrational decision making is anticipated, leading to quack cures and dubious prophylactic measures.6 Appropriate public education is mandatory to fight the misinformation that is being spread through social media about the alcohol and other similar disinfecting agents. This is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality and also to protect an already exhausted healthcare system from excess burden during a devastating pandemic.References↵

Is methanol poisonous?,https://www.vinmec.com/en/news/health-news/why-can-methanol-alcohol-cause-poisoning/," 3. Alcohol preparation methods cause high methanol content leading to poisoning
 Using materials with wood residue (cellulose): Normally, ethanol is distilled from rice or cane sugar, so it is not toxic. However, some distilleries use molasses that is not clean of residues (cellulose contains cellulose in bagasse), leading to the phenomenon that during distillation fermentation, the residue decomposes to produce methanol. If using bagasse or using molasses with residue to make alcohol, the methanol content in the alcohol will be high, easy to cause acute alcohol poisoning; Production of alcohol from poor quality ethyl alcohol: A large amount of alcohol on the market is prepared by mixing alcohol with water. On average, 1 liter of alcohol can make 3 liters of alcohol without the effort or cost of making wine by distillation. More dangerously, many owners of alcohol production facilities use poor quality alcohol (cheap, high content of methanol, aldehyde, acetone) so when making alcohol, there will be high content of methanol, aldehyde, acetone.",easy to cause acute alcohol poisoning,neutral,"

Methanol is non-toxic, but its metabolites (formic acid, methanol) are incredibly toxic. The main toxic effects do not become apparent until methanol is metabolized to formic acid and accumulates to toxic levels. Therefore, clinical symptoms typically evolve within 6 to 24 h but can be postponed to 72 to 96 h if ethanol is co-ingested (7).

Methanol poisoning by ingestion is a global problem, and it is closely related to high morbidity and mortality [3]. Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase subsequently oxidizes formaldehyde to formic acid, which accounts for the associated anion gap metabolic acidosis and end-organ damage [4]. Therefore, methanol ingestion can be fatal. Pure methanol lethal dose is estimated to range from 300 to 1000 mg/kg [5]. Although the recommendations of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology practice guidelines on the treatment of methanol poisoning are already 20 years old [6], they are still valid because mass poisonings with beverages containing methanol occur all over the world [7,8,9].",methanol ingestion can be fatal,neutral,"

visual disturbances characterized by optic neuritis and eventual blindness 1,3 
CNS features such as a headache, dizziness, fatigue, and eventual permanent neurological dysfunction 1-3

gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 1,4

About one in 250 women had undergone an MRI during pregnancy, one in 1,200 during the first trimester and one in 3,000 with gadolinium contrast. Health of the babies was followed from birth until they were 4 years old.Having an MRI during the first trimester was not tied to an increased risk of stillbirth, newborn death, cancer, congenital defects or hearing loss in the children.Only 397 women had gadolinium contrast MRIs during pregnancy, compared to more than 1.4 million without any MRI in this comparison.Connective tissue or infiltrating skin conditions like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were about 36 percent more common in babies born to the gadolinium group than the no-MRI group, according to the results in JAMA. More broadly, rheumatological and inflammatory conditions were similarly increased by about 45 cases per 1,000 children per year.There were seven stillbirths or newborn deaths in the gadolinium group compared to 9,844 in the no-MRI group, so while still rare, these outcomes were twice as common in the gadolinium group, the authors note.An adult body processes and clears gadolinium contrast materials through the urine, but a fetus exposed via the placenta will continually urinate and ingest the same material in the amniotic fluid until birth, Ray said.“The theory was that you can recirculate gadolinium over and over again, and this brings that theory a little bit closer to a clinical point,” he said.Gadolinium can usually be avoided during pregnancy, but “in a woman who is pregnant, if she really needs gadolinium then she’s the priority,” he said.“Potential risk versus benefit should always be assessed when an imaging study is recommended,” said Dr. Dorothy Bulas, professor of pediatrics and radiology at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. “This study is reassuring and helps support the use of MRI at any gestation if there is a valid indication for the exam,” she said by email.“The study also supports the need to avoid gadolinium in the pregnant patient unless the maternal benefits truly outweigh the potential fetal risks that were noted in this large study cohort,” Bulas added.Current contrast media guidelines already incorporate appropriate safety concerns, said Dr. Karen Oh of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland, who was not part of the new study.“Doctors should continue to provide appropriate prenatal care and utilize MRI when indicated; and women should ask and receive explanations for indications for studies during pregnancy, have their questions answered appropriately, so that they can feel comfortable with the care they are receiving,” Oh told Reuters Health by email.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Pregnant women may be exposed to MRI contrast agent

 Aug 20, 2019




By Carolyn Crist
(Reuters Health) – Women who don’t realize they’re pregnant when they undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be exposed to a chemical that might not be safe for the fetus, a new report warns. The chemical, a dye called gadolinium contrast media, is used in about 30% to 45% of MRI scans in the U.S. to help enhance differences in internal organs, soft tissues, blood vessels, and bones. “It is known that gadolinium contrast crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation,” said lead study author Steven Bird of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The safety of gadolinium-based contrast agents, or GBCAs, in pregnant women “has not been established, and their use during pregnancy is not recommended unless essential to the health of the woman or fetus,” Bird told Reuters Health by email. “Available data from cohort studies and case reports have revealed inconsistent findings regarding the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes.”

Bird and colleagues used the FDA-funded Sentinel Distributed Database to analyze data from nearly 4.7 million pregnancies in that resulted in live births between 2006 and 2017.",may be exposed to a chemical that might not be safe for the fetus,neutral,"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very safe and most people are able to have the procedure.But in some instances an MRI scan may not be recommended.When your doctor refers you for an MRI scan, tell them if:you think you have any metal in or on your bodyyou're pregnant or breastfeedingyou've ever had an allergic reaction to a contrast agentyou have kidney problemsThe strong magnets used during the scan can affect any metal implants or fragments in your body.There's no evidence that MRI scans are a risk for pregnant women, but whether you'll be offered one depends on why you need it.A doctor can discuss with you whether an MRI scan or contrast agent (dye) is suitable for you. If you do have an MRI scan, the radiographers will make sure it's as safe as possible for you and your baby. Metal implants or fragments
Having something metallic in your body doesn't necessarily mean you can't have an MRI scan, but it's important for medical staff carrying out the scan to be aware of it.They can decide on a case-by-case basis if there are any risks, or if further measures need to be taken to ensure the scan is as safe as possible.For example, it may be possible to make a pacemaker or defibrillator MRI-safe, or to monitor your heart rhythm during the procedure.You may need to have an X-ray if you're unsure about any metal fragments in your body.Examples of metal implants or fragments include:a pacemaker – a small electrical device used to control an irregular heartbeatan implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – a similar device to a pacemaker that uses electrical shocks to regulate heartbeatsmetal plates, wires, screws or rods – used during surgery for bone fracturesa nerve stimulator – an electrical implant used to treat long-term nerve paina cochlear implant – a device similar to a hearing aid that's surgically implanted inside the eara drug pump implant – used to treat long-term pain by delivering painkilling medication directly to an area of the body, such as the lower backbrain aneurysm clips – small metal clips used to seal blood vessels in the brain that would otherwise be at risk of rupturing (bursting)stents, filters and vascular coils – small metal devices that are surgically implanted in blood vesselsmetallic fragments in or near your eyes or blood vessels (common in people who do welding or metalwork for a living)prosthetic (artificial) metal heart valvespenile implants – used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence)eye implants – such as small metal clips used to hold the retina in placean intrauterine device (IUD) or coil – a contraceptive device made of plastic and copper that fits inside the wombartificial joints – such as those used for a hip replacement or knee replacementdental fillings and bridgestubal ligation clips – used in female sterilisationsurgical clips or staples – used to close wounds after an operationtattoos or permanent make-upobjects such as bullets or shrapnelbreast expanders – used after a mastectomyinsulin pumps and glucose monitors – electronic devices used by some people with diabetes


Tattoos
Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal, but most tattoos are safe in an MRI scanner.Tell the radiographer immediately if you feel any discomfort or heat in your tattoo during the scan. Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/10/guidelines-for-diagnostic-imaging-during-pregnancy-and-lactation," There are no precautions or contraindications specific to the pregnant woman. Magnetic resonance imaging is similar to ultrasonography in the diagnosis of appendicitis, but when MRI is readily available, it is preferred because of its lower rates of nonvisualization 6. Although there are theoretical concerns for the fetus, including teratogenesis, tissue heating, and acoustic damage, there exists no evidence of actual harm. With regard to teratogenesis, there are no published human studies documenting harm, and the preponderance of animal studies do not demonstrate risk 1. Tissue heating is proportional to the tissue’s proximity to the scanner and, therefore, is negligible near the uterus 1 7. Finally, available studies in humans have documented no acoustic injuries to fetuses during prenatal MRI 1.",there exists no evidence of actual harm,neutral,"

Exactly how exercise works in improving your cholesterol levels is still not totally clear. Although there have been studies examining the effects of exercise on cholesterol, these studies have also been coupled with other cholesterol-lowering lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet or losing weight. Recent studies examining the effect of exercise alone reveal a few ways that exercise may help improve your cholesterol levels:



Lipoprotein particle size. Some studies have shown that exercise can change your LDL (aka bad cholesterol).﻿﻿ Smaller lipoproteins, such as small, dense LDL, have been associated with contributing to cardiovascular disease but having larger LDL particles do not carry this same risk. Studies have shown that moderate exercise can increase the size of your LDL particles, which can help to reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

The liver, in fact, makes all the cholesterol you need. Some people generate too much of their own cholesterol, and high cholesterol can be genetically inherited.But cholesterol also comes from animal-based foods, such as meat, poultry and full-fat dairy products.

Further, the authors suggested that additional physiological systems benefited from resistance training, making it potentially more effective.Yang et al.

Or you can change the resistance / strengthening activity from weight training to calisthenics. But the intensity should be kept the same to have an effect on your cholesterol levels.Sometimes having a variety of activities in an exercise programme helps in adherence but it is not necessary. It ultimately depends on the natural inclination of the individual.Other health benefits of exerciseBesides improving your cholesterol numbers, the overall health benefits of exercise are immense.When you exercise, you are also getting many other cardiovascular benefits, like a lower blood pressure and a diminished risk of heart attack and stroke. Exercise has also been shown to contribute to a lower risk of cancer. Of course, it also promotes weight loss as well as an overall sense of well-being.Be sure to heed your doctor’s advice concerning exercise and cholesterol management, and take your prescribed medication regularly.Ref: ​​​​​T12

Can chewing gum help lose weight?,https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/health-talk-can-chewing-gum-help-you-lose-weight/," There are several theories why chewing gum may support weight loss, but research doesn’t show strong results.One often-quoted study found that chewing gum may burn about 11 calories an hour. This could be compared to the small extra daily calorie burn found in people who tap their toes or otherwise “fidget” all day, and it is unlikely to produce weight loss. Others propose that the act of chewing may lead to changes in digestive hormones that decrease hunger, thus making it easier to cut calories for weight loss. This makes sense in theory, but short-term controlled trials haven’t shown the expected hormonal change.Chewing gum may aid weight loss by replacing overeating for some. Participants in one controlled study showed a ten percent drop in mid-afternoon snacking when they chewed gum 15 minutes each hour after lunch.

Much of the cataract-producing damage caused by the sun’s UV rays can be prevented by wearing proper sunglasses. Studies show that wearing UV-blocking sunglasses when you’re young helps reduce the risks of developing cataracts as you age. The key is selecting sunglasses that provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. UVA and UVB are the variations of ultraviolet rays that can be damaging to your eyes. Many people take UV protection for granted when buying sunglasses, but just because the lenses are tinted dark, doesn’t mean they’re equipped to protect your eyes from UV rays. A reliable pair of UV-blocking sunglasses will have UV protection embedded in the lenses rather than just a coating on the lenses.",can be prevented by wearing proper sunglasses,neutral,"

                Can Sunglasses Help Prevent Cataracts? May 6, 2022


     











Medically reviewed by Susan Kerrigan, MD and Marianne Madsen




A cataract is an area in the lens of the eye, made up of clumps of protein, that clouds vision and diminishes eyesight. Cataracts are common in older Americans. By age 75, half of all white Americans and around 40 percent of black Americans will have developed cataracts.","

Can sunglasses help prevent cataracts?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/cataracts/prevention/," (2)There are, however, steps that may reduce your cataract risk:1. Protect Your Eyes From Harmful Ultraviolet RaysWearing sunglasses that protect your eyes from ultraviolet (UV) rays may help prevent or slow the development of cataracts.Ultraviolet B rays are especially harmful to your eyes, so it’s important to look for glasses that provide this protection specifically.It’s a good idea to wear protective sunglasses any time you’re outside during daylight, not only when the sun is especially bright or shining at an angle that disturbs your vision.If you’d rather not wear sunglasses outside or are looking for protection when you’re indoors, you can also wear regular clear glasses with a UV-blocking coating.Talk to your doctor about your options and the benefits of each type of protective glasses. (1,2)2. See an Eye Doctor Regularly to Know Your Cataract StatusWhile visiting your eye doctor won’t directly prevent cataracts, it can help you stay aware of your cataract status and learn about measures that could help prevent or manage the condition.And once you’ve started to develop cataracts, it’s important to track your condition through regular appointments. Talk to your doctor about how often you should be stopping by for an office visit.Generally, adults over age 60 should have a comprehensive eye exam at least every two years, according to the National Eye Institute. Doing this can also help screen for conditions like macular degeneration and glaucoma, which can require treatment that may be complicated by having cataracts.",RaysWearing sunglasses that protect your eyes from ultraviolet (UV) rays,neutral,"

Vision loss happens slowlyMost cataracts are found in people over the age of 60, but changes to the eye start happening around the age of 40, and cataracts can occasionally occur in babies or young children. Loss of transparency develops slowly, causing a gradual and painless decrease in vision. In addition to blurriness, changes experienced can include:

Glare, particularly at night
Frequent changes in your vision prescription
A decrease in colour intensity
A yellowing of images
Improved close-up vision for farsighted people, or reduced distance vision for nearsighted people

Risk factors also include some medications (e.g., steroids), systemic diseases such as diabetes, eye injuries, smoking and close family history of cataracts. Treatment and preventionEyeglasses or contact lenses can usually correct slight vision changes caused by early cataracts, but they cannot sharpen vision once a cataract is severe. Once one has developed, there is no cure except to have the cataract surgically removed. Canadians can help protect themselves against cataracts by reducing exposure to ultraviolet light by wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, not smoking, and ensuring regular eye exams with their eye doctor.",Canadians can help protect themselves against cataracts by reducing exposure to ultraviolet light,neutral,"

Ultraviolet (UV) light or exposure, such as prolonged sun exposure without using sunglasses, as well as smoking can increase your risk of developing a cataract. To reduce your risk of cataracts or slow their progression, you should:

Wear sunglasses to minimize UV damage. Look for sunglasses that block 99-100% of UV light (both UV-A and UV-B rays). Wearing a hat or other sun protection can also minimize exposure to UV rays. Avoid or quit smoking, which is associated with significantly higher risk of cataracts

When too much UV light tries to enter your eye, your body will instinctively try to prevent it.

Can sunglasses help prevent cataracts?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/sunglasses-help-prevent-eye-disease," Protection around the eyesAnother factor to consider is that sunglasses help protect the skin around the eyes — areas where it can be hard to apply sunscreen.The AAO advisory recommends buying oversized shades to help protect these areas as well as to cut down on UV rays entering from the sides.For those who want to make sure their shades offer adequate UV protection, the best option is to seek out a UV light meter to test how well the lenses block out UV rays. These meters are commonly found at optical shops.Wearers of contact lenses can easily wear a pair of nonprescription sunglasses to help protect their eyes. But it’s also worth noting that many brands of contact lenses also offer UV protection.“Most rigid gas permeable hard lenses have an ultraviolet filter, which is helpful in protecting from UV rays,” says McLaughlin.“Good sunglasses will certainly help protect the eyes in terms of reducing UV exposure,” concludes McLaughlin. “This will help protect the eyes in terms of lowering the progression of cataracts.

Older adults with cataracts and those who are light-sensitive may find that they need to wear sunglasses more than they used to. This is because light passing through aging corneas and lenses is scattered to a greater degree. This scattering effect can be alleviated with sunglasses with polarized lenses.

Harmful UV light rays from the sun can speed up the growth of your cataract, but opting for UV filtering sunglasses can slow this down, allowing your eyes and the sensitive skin around them to remain protected.

And while we tend to associate cataracts with age, spending a lot of time in the sun is also a risk factor. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, about 10% of cataract cases can be attributed to UV exposure. It’s thought that the eye’s lens absorbs UV light. A 2014 study published in Journal of Biological Chemistry found that UV light harms lens proteins, causing damaging oxidative reactions, possibly leading to cataract formation. “Wearing sunglasses to prevent premature cataract formation is a good idea,” says Jessica S.

According to a 2014 study funded by the U.S. National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, UV radiation can damage proteins in the eye’s lens. Over time, this damage can raise a person’s risk for cataracts, which impair vision.","Markham Heid

The current study also could be comparable with the French study, which reported professional exposure to sunlight might increase 63% of posterior subcapsular cataract, but frequent use of sunglasses might offer a 40% decrease in the risk of posterior subcapsular cataract [24]. Based on such evidence, encouraging the public to use hats, sunglasses and umbrellas during period of high UVR is therefore beneficial, effective, and imperative.Interestingly, knowledge and attitudes toward sunlight protection did not necessarily translate into behavior of practices of ocular protection under harsh daylight as noticed in the current study. Although sunglasses can be used to protect eyes from UVR to reduce risk of cataract, the actual percentage of individuals to wear sunglasses for sunlight protection might be suboptimal.

HIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study Finds






Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuScienceNewsHIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study FindsResearchers have found new clues to the deadly disease's origins.ByStefan LovgrenPublished June 12, 2003• 7 min readShareTweetEmailScientists now say that the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which is believed to have been transmitted to humans to become HIV-1—the virus that causes AIDS—didn't start its life in chimps.Instead, it was a product of separate viruses jumping from different monkey species into chimps, where they recombined to form a hybrid virus, according to a new study.Researchers believe the chimpanzee virus is a hybrid of the SIVs naturally infecting two different monkeys, the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) and the greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans). Chimps eat monkeys, which is likely how they acquired the monkey viruses. The hybrid virus then spread through the chimpanzee species, and was later transmitted to humans to become HIV-1.The study suggests striking parallels between SIV infection of chimps and HIV infection of humans. Just as chimps acquired viruses from two different sources, humans are infected by two distinct AIDS viruses: HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2, which humans acquired from sooty mangabey monkeys. ""Because of the similarity between chimpanzees and humans, any virus that successfully adapts to spreading among chimps would be a candidate for a further jump to humans—a potential HIV-3,"" said Paul Sharp of the Institute of Genetics at University of Nottingham in England, who led the study.The discovery also spotlights how many of our most virulent viruses were transmitted across species.

The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since its discovery in 1983. Its origin in wild primates-the apes and monkeys-has long been accepted, but the question remained-which ones, and how could it have been transmitted? The first question is answered by a report in Nature: Beatrice H. Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and colleagues [from the USA, France and the UK] provide the most persuasive evidence yet that HIV-1 entered the human population from the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, our nearest living relative.From their analysis, it is now almost certain that HIV-1 entered the human population from chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which lives in equatorial west Africa, in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, where the HIV-1 virus is thought, on other evidence, to have emerged in humans.Chimpanzees, like many other primates, harbour simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). These closely resemble HIV but appear to co-exist far more successfully with their animal hosts, pointing to an ancient association between virus and host.",wild primates-the apes and monkeys,neutral,"

Interestingly, close simian relatives of HIV-1 and HIV-2 were found in chimpanzees (Huet et al. 1990) and sooty mangabeys (Hirsch et al. 1989), respectively. These relationships provided the first evidence that AIDS had emerged in both humans and macaques as a consequence of cross-species infections with lentiviruses from different primate species (Sharp et al. 1994).",AIDS had emerged in both humans and macaques,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.beintheknow.org/understanding-hiv-epidemic/context/origin-hiv-and-aids," HIV is thought to have occurred after people ate chimps that were carrying the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). HIV is a type of lentivirus, which means it attacks the immune system. SIV attacks the immune systems of monkeys and apes in a very similar way. This suggests HIV and SIV are closely related, and that SIV in monkeys and apes crossed over to humans to become HIV. Where and when did HIV start?Studies of some of the earliest known samples of HIV provide clues about when it first appeared in humans and how it evolved.

In Africa, HIV–the virus that causes AIDS–had jumped from chimpanzees to humans sometime early in the 20th century. To date, the earliest known case of HIV-1 infection in human blood is from a sample taken in 1959 from a man who’d died in Kinshasa in what was then the Belgian Congo.

HIV likely arose from blood contact when humans handled bushmeat from SIV-infected apes. In some ways it’s surprising that HIV’s chimp precursor hasn’t cropped up more often, said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Michael Emerman. The birth of SIVcpz “was a very unusual event, because it only happened one time that we know of in evolutionary history,” said Emerman, who studies the viral, chimp and human evolutionary steps that ultimately allowed HIV to come into the world. “And we know that there are lots of exposures, because chimpanzees eat a lot of monkeys and a lot of these monkeys have their own version of these SIVs.”
In a study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Pathogens, Emerman and his colleagues describe their findings on the chimp genes that may normally protect chimps from monkey-borne SIVs — and could be the critical immune blockade that was breached only once, when SIVcpz arose.

And a study in 2019 in the medical journal, Lancet, showed that an anti-viral treatment effectively halted the spread of HIV.Where Did AIDS Come From? Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then led to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home.",Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html," The majority of HIV researchers subscribe to the bushmeat theory and raise several arguments against the OPV theory. Hahn's recent research confirming that HIV-1 M and N arose from Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps in Cameroon presents one problem: The Kisangani lab is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it's home to a different subspecies of chimp than the one that was the source of HIV-1 M and N. However, it is possible that the chimps used in the Kisangani experiments were not from the area. In the spring of 2006, Hooper found a paper indicating that at least one of eight chimps at the Kisangani lab was a Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The 1959 sample also presents a problem for the OPV theory. Judging by how fast the virus mutates, it had already diverged significantly from its SIV ancestors by the time doctors extracted it from a patient.

This chimpanzee of West-African origin was infected with three different HIV-1 isolates. The animal eventually developed AIDS, and subsequent analysis showed that a recombinant HIV-1 strain had emerged. Three other chimpanzees that were afterwards infected with this recombinant strain all developed signs of AIDS-like disease [46]. This set of experiments shows that viruses that have been edited in the human population, and that are re-introduced into their original host species, can cause AIDS. Thus, escape from immune control in chimpanzees is possible in exceptional cases, even within a species considered to be relatively resistant.Control of AIDS development in humans: an introduction to the MHCIn HIV-1-infected human cohorts, certain individuals do not progress towards AIDS.",chimpanzees can develop AIDS,neutral,"

strains but shared key features: All came from Pan troglodytes troglodytes
chimps that originated in central west Africa; all are genetically 70 percent
to 90 percent identical to human AIDS viruses; and in no case did the viruses
appear to sicken the chimps or cause any illness. So it's probable, experts now say, that HIV-1 did come

human over the last four or five decades.","HIV-1 did come

Chimpanzees may have evolved resistance to HIV precursor



          11 December 2019        





                  Simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey- and ape-infecting virus that HIV originated from, may have influenced the genetics of chimpanzees, finds a new UCL-led study. The virus is a leading contributor to differences between chimpanzee subspecies, according to the findings published in PLOS Genetics.While chimpanzees are not badly affected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the researchers say the findings suggest that some subspecies may have evolved a degree of tolerance to the virus.“Unlike humans, who when infected by HIV suffer devastating health consequences, chimpanzees can remain healthy when infected with the SIV virus,” said the study’s senior author, Dr Aida Andrés (UCL Genetics Institute and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology).“This suggests that chimpanzees may have evolved biological mechanisms to limit the virus’ pathogenicity - that is, the virus’ ability to cause disease.”By analysing the genomes of four subspecies of chimpanzees living in Africa, the research team found that the genetic variants that evolved uniquely in eastern chimpanzees were disproportionately related to immune responses, particularly to the response to infection by SIV.The strongest selective pressure (any factor contributing to how subspecies have evolved differently) that the authors could identify was on immune system function, believed to be due to adaptation to SIV, as the virus appears to have significantly contributed to genetic differences between subspecies.“Only two subspecies of chimpanzees seem infected by the virus in the wild (central and eastern chimpanzees) and it is precisely those two subspecies that accumulate genetic changes in genes related to SIV infection,” said Dr Joshua Schmidt, the first author of the paper (UCL Genetics Institute, now at the University of Adelaide).Co-author Dr Sergi Castellano (UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology), said: “As the genes we identified may have contributed to a reduction of the pathogenicity of SIV in chimpanzees, it would be interesting to study them in humans infected by HIV.”Chimpanzees, humans’ closest relatives, are in danger of extinction, and transmissible disease is among the top threats, so the findings may also be relevant to conservation efforts.The study involved researchers at the UCL Genetics Institute, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (Barcelona), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, and Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (Barcelona), and was supported by Max Planck Society, Wellcome, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research and the NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre.","HIV originated from, may have influenced the genetics of chimpanzees",neutral,"

And it is—unless you drink too much of it. Though most people look out for the signs of dehydration, experts say overhydration can be equally as dangerous. Drinking too much water generally results in nothing worse than a frequent flier pass to the restroom—but under certain circumstances, it can cause extreme illness and even death, says Austin DeRosa, MD, urologist with UCHealth Cancer Center in Highlands Ranch, Colorado and chair of robotic surgery at the University of Colorado Medicine.

Normal kidneys can release up to a quart of fluid every hour. If you drink more than that, you’ll retain the excess water in your body, which causes a condition known as hyponatremia and can be hazardous to your health.

While it may seem like good advice, drinking too much water can lead to a myriad of problems, including brain damage, and dilute the blood stream, leading to water poisoning.‍What Happens When You Drink Too Much Water?Excessive water intake will increase the level of water in the bloodstream, and dilute your blood sodium concentration. When this happens, your body cannot function properly as the electrolytes meant to deliver oxygen and nutrients throughout your organs can no longer balance the level of fluids in your cells.Compulsive water drinking may damage brain cells, and cause a disruption in your brain functions. As excess water enters the bloodstream, cells begin to swell and burst, causing mild symptoms such as a headache, to life threatening symptoms such as shortness of breath.

   Is it possible to drink too much water? In short, yes: There is such a thing as drinking too much water—but why is that bad? ""Kidneys can excrete up to 28 liters of fluid in a day, but only one liter an hour,"" says Christina Lang, MD, internal medicine and pediatric physician at UCHealth in Fort Collins. ""Drinking more than this can lead to water intoxication and electrolyte imbalances."" According to Natasha Trentacosta, MD, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, overhydration is often seen in athletes if they drink an excessive amount of water.

Drinking water is essential to keeping the body healthy and functioning properly. However, there's such a thing as drinking too much water too fast, aka water intoxication.Water intoxication occurs when you drink so much water that the kidneys can't eliminate it fast enough, so it begins to dilute electrolytes — primarily sodium — in the blood. Although it's rare, water intoxication can lead to death if not treated immediately.Here are the symptoms of water intoxication and how it is generally treated. How much is too much water?Water intoxication is a dangerous and severe condition because blood sodium levels drop rapidly, causing neurologic changes like hallucinations and confusion.Important: Drinking too much water can lead to hyponatremia, which occurs when blood sodium levels drop below 134 mEq/L.

During water toxicity, excess water migrates to sites in the body with increased solute concentration due to osmosis. This site is often inside the cell, and during water intoxication, cells begin to swell.The danger increases when neurons in the central nervous system begin to swell as this increases pressure inside the enclosed cranium which leads to symptoms of confusion, lethargy, headache, drowsiness, and under certain circumstances seizures or coma.

Is too much water bad for you?,https://time.com/5646632/how-much-water-to-drink/," In some rare cases, excessive water consumption can even be harmful. “In athletes or people who are exercising for hours, if they’re only drinking water, they can throw out too much sodium in their urine, which leads to an imbalance in the body’s sodium levels,” explains Nieman, who has spent a chunk of his career investigating exercise-related hydration. Doctors call this imbalance “hyponatremia,” and in some cases it can be deadly. In this scenario, sports drinks and other beverages that contain nutrients and sodium are safer than plain water. While hyponatremia and excessive water consumption aren’t big concerns for non-athletes, there are better ways to keep the body and brain hydrated than to pound water all day long. Sipping water (or any other beverage) a little bit at a time prevents the kidneys from being “overloaded,” and so helps the body retain more H2O, Nieman says.",excessive water consumption can even be harmful,yes,"

It's easy to overlook, but choosing healthier drinks is a key part of getting a balanced diet.Many soft drinks, including instant powdered drinks and hot chocolate, are high in sugar.Food and drinks that are high in sugar are often high in calories, and having too many calories can make you more likely to gain weight.Some energy drinks are high in both sugar and caffeine. Checking the nutrition labels on soft drinks such as fruit juices and fizzy drinks can help you make healthier choices.The Eatwell Guide says we should drink 6 to 8 cups or glasses of fluid a day. Water, lower-fat milk and sugar-free drinks, including tea and coffee, all count.Find out more about food labels

Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.Find HIV testing services near youThe only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.It's important to be aware that:emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hoursan early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to othersBoth positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV testhome testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few daysIf your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load.",HIV cannot,no,"

Although reference books assert that HIV does not transmit through sweat, to our knowledge, there is no systemic study which this statement is based upon. This study aims to investigate the potential of sweat to transmit HIV infection.METHODS:This study included 31 treatment-naive HIV RNA-positive patients who were in the acute phase of the infection and 26 subjects with a negative HIV RNA test who had received antiviral treatment. A total of 57 sweat samples collected from intact skin areas were prospectively evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HIV RNA. HIV RNA levels in the blood samples were also noted.RESULTS:HIV RNA was not detected by PCR in any sweat sample taken from HIV-infected HIV RNA-negative and -positive subjects.CONCLUSION:The findings obtained in this study suggest that sweat by itself has no potential for transmitting HIV infection.Keywords: HIV, HIV transmission route, polymerase chain reaction, sweatHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a worldwide health problem [1]. Although the worldwide incidence of HIV infection has decreased, the prevalence of HIV infection has increased with the increased life expectancy among patients receiving antiviral treatment (ART) [2].Many studies reported that HIV was mainly transmitted through parenteral exposure, sexual activity, and body secretions, such as saliva and semen [1–3] A high HIV RNA level in blood is the greatest risk factor for the transmission of HIV [4] Risk of transmission can be reduced through early diagnosis, protection and decreasing HIV RNA levels by early treatment [5].HIV-positive individuals get in contact with others in their daily lives.",HIV does not transmit through sweat,no,"

HIV is not spread in such settings where exposures are repeated and prolonged and can involve contact with an infected person's body fluids, so it is even less likely to be spread in other casual social settings, such as schools and offices. Saliva, sweat, tears, urine, or feces
HIV cannot be spread by sharing drinking glasses or by casual kissing. The risk of spreading the virus through ""deep"" kissing in which large amounts of saliva are exchanged is extremely low. Only one unproven case has ever been reported. No cases of HIV spread have ever been reported after a person has come in contact with the sweat, tears, urine, or feces of an HIV-infected person.",No cases of HIV spread have ever been reported,neutral,"

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.thewellproject.org/hiv-information/hiv-transmission," When a person living with HIV is taking HIV drugs and their viral load has stayed at undetectable levels (not enough HIV in their bloodstream for a test to measure), that person cannot sexually transmit HIV to a partner. This is called treatment as prevention, and is often represented in the HIV community by the simple phrase “undetectable equals untransmittable,” or ""U=U."" For more information on this development, see our fact sheet Undetectable Equals Untransmittable: Building Hope and Ending HIV Stigma. HIV is also spread through contact with the body fluids below. However, usually only health care workers come into contact with these fluids. They are:

Cerebrospinal fluid around the brain and spinal cord
Synovial fluid around the joints
Amniotic fluid around a developing fetus (or baby in the womb)

HIV is not spread through contact with these body fluids:

Sweat
Tears
Saliva (spit)
Feces (poop)
Urine (pee)

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids," HIV is most commonly transmitted through vaginal or anal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include:
using a contaminated needle, syringe or other equipment to inject drugs
transmission from a mother to her child before, during or shortly after birth however, with medical treatment it is possible to prevent the virus from being passed on by a mother to her child
through blood transfusions however, since 1985 all blood donated in the UK must be screened for HIV - screening policies in the developing world may not be as rigorous, so there is a possible risk of developing HIV if you receive a blood transfusion in certain parts of the world
through oral sex or sharing sex toys
HIV cannot be transmitted from:
kissing
being sneezed on by someone with HIV
sharing baths, towels or cutlery with an HIV-infected person
swimming in a pool or sitting on a toilet seat that someone with HIV has used
animals or insects such as mosquitoes
Saliva, sweat and urine do not contain enough of the HIV virus to infect another person. Finding out you are HIV positive
People who are at increased risk
HIV can affect anyone but people who are at a higher risk include:
men who have had unprotected sex with men
women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men
people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived in, or travelled in, Africa
people who inject drugs
people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs
people who have another sexually transmitted infection
people who have received a blood transfusion while in Africa, eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, Asia or central and southern America
Protecting yourself from HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles, syringes or other injecting equipment. Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. You should use condoms for oral, vaginal and anal sex and pieces of latex (dental dams or plastic wrap) which act as a barrier, for oral sex on the vagina or anus.","Saliva, sweat and urine",neutral,"

Bites from other animals, like a dog, cat, or snake, also can’t transmit the virus.Through salivaIf an HIV-positive person spits in food or drink, there’s no risk of getting HIV because saliva doesn’t transmit the virus.UrineHIV can’t be transmitted via urine. Sharing a toilet or coming into contact with the urine of an HIV-positive person doesn’t pose a risk of transmission.Dried blood or semenHIV can’t survive for very long outside the body. If there is contact with blood (or other bodily fluids) that has dried or has been outside the body for a while, there isn’t a risk for transmission. How HIV is transmittedA person living with HIV can only transmit the virus through certain bodily fluids if they have a detectable viral load.

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/congenital-hiv," HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is the virus which, when untreated, becomes AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The virus attacks the body's immune system, especially white blood cells called CD-4 cells (also called ""T-cells""). Your immune system is what fights against infections to keep your body healthy and T-cells play a key role in keeping a person protected from infections. If your immune system is weakened, it can't protect your body and you can easily get sick. AIDS/HIV:
can be spread from mother to unborn baby, but the risk of passing the virus to your baby can be reduced
cannot be transferred through sweat, saliva or casual contact with someone who is infected

Your periods have not returned. Your baby is exclusively and frequently fed from your breasts- this is especially important to remember when your little one begins sleeping through the night.

Can a woman get pregnant while breastfeeding?,https://www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/ovulation/can-you-get-pregnant-while-breastfeeding/," You may have heard from a friend that nursing can serve as a form of birth control — and while that’s not entirely untrue, it’s not the whole story either.Can you get pregnant while you’re breastfeeding?The simple answer is yes. Although breastfeeding offers some protection from ovulation, the monthly occurrence where you release a mature egg from one of your ovaries, it is possible to ovulate and become pregnant prior to getting your first period.The key players here are the hormones oxytocin and prolactin, which are responsible for milk production and the let-down reflex. Increased levels of these hormones actually suppress the brain from making the main hormone that stimulates the ovary to grow an egg each month. When a mother is breastfeeding exclusively, or even on a consistent basis, it is less likely that she is going to ovulate at all until she starts to wean.That doesn’t mean that you won’t ovulate or conceive. The ""protective"" effect of breastfeeding becomes progressively less effective the longer it's been since you delivered your baby.

Yes, it's possible to get pregnant any time from about three weeks after giving birth. This is true even if you're breastfeeding and haven't had a period yet. Many women are less fertile while they're breastfeeding, especially in the early weeks and months. This is because breastfeeding reduces your levels of certain hormones (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and luteinising hormone), which are needed for ovulation and pregnancy. The more your baby breastfeeds, the lower your hormone levels will be, and the less likely you are to become pregnant. If your baby is under six months and exclusively breastfeeding day and night, your chances of conception are low.",it's possible to get pregnant any time from about three weeks after giving birth,neutral,"

However, this is not universally true for all women and should not be relied upon as a reliable method of contraception. When breastfeeding can act as birth control: the LAM method
One form of natural contraception brought about by breastfeeding is the lactational amenorrhea method, or LAM. (Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation.) This method is grounded in the scientific belief that exclusive breastfeeding suppresses a woman’s fertility, thereby preventing pregnancy. LAM can be a very effective family planning method as long as certain conditions are met:

the woman’s period has not returned since she gave birth
the baby is exclusively breastfeeding on demand and is not eating any other foods or liquids
the baby is less than 6 months old

If the mother and baby meet all of these conditions, the chance of pregnancy is very low (less than 2%, according to World Alliance for Breastfeeding).",you can’t get pregnant,no,"

Some Statins Appear to Increase Dementia in Patients With Mild Cognitive Issues

By staff


Does the use of some of the most commonly prescribed statins significantly increase the risk of developing dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment?Research presented at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2021 Annual Meeting advises that positron emission tomography (PET) scans of lipophilic statin users revealed a highly significant decline in metabolism in the area of the brain that is first impacted by Alzheimer's disease when those cholesterol-lowering drugs were used in certain circumstances.In other words, according to the University of California at Los Angeles authors, taking lipophilic statins—which include atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and pitavastatin—appears to more than double those patients’ risk of developing dementia compared with those who do not take statins. While hydrophilic statins focus on the liver, lipophilic statins are distributed to tissues throughout the body.“There have been many conflicting studies on the effects of statin drugs on cognition,” said Prasanna Padmanabham, project head of the statins and cognition in the molecular and medical pharmacology student research program at UCLA. “While some claim that statins protect users against dementia, others assert that they accelerate the development of dementia. Our study aimed to clarify the relationship between statin use and subject’s long-term cognitive trajectory.”The study team looked at several factors:• Neuropsychological status at baseline, • Relatively high versus low serum cholesterol levels at baseline• Statin use versus nonuse • Among users, type of statin used. “The present analysis focuses upon outcomes of subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), comparing users of statins with known moderate (atorvastatin) or high (simvastatin) lipophilicity and blood-brain barrier penetrance (LS), to non-users (nonS), or users of other statins (OS),” the authors explain.Participants were enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative at over 50 North American sites. The patients were then grouped into those above (n = 103) or below (n = 200) the median cholesterol level of the nonuser subjects (206 mg/dl).Researchers report that, while serum cholesterol levels at baseline ranged widely (101-358 mg/dl), among all eMCI subjects, the average baseline cholesterol levels did not significantly differ between those who converted to dementia within 96 months as opposed to those who did not.After excluding statin users with less than 96 months of use, the below-median cholesterol group consisted of 157 patients—67 nonusers, 72 on lipophilic statins, and 18 on other statins; within that group, according to researchers, average serum levels also did not differ between those who did (166 mg/dl) and did not (171 mg/dl) convert to dementia.","

This study compared 900 statin users and 5000 non-users from the UK Biobank. Results showed that the effects of statins vary significantly with age. Indeed, individuals over 65 showed an improvement in reaction time whereas individuals under 65 displayed impairment in working memory. The same study has shown both age groups of statin users benefited from statin treatment, but the benefit was stronger in individuals under 65, suggesting that statin therapy in midlife could be more beneficial for cognitive function (Alsehli et al., 2020). The modifying effect of age on the association between statin and AD has been supported by other studies including statin types and sex covariates.",the effects of statins vary significantly with age,neutral,"

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://scitechdaily.com/does-statin-use-for-cholesterol-control-cause-cognitive-decline-dementia/amp/," The Food and Drug Administration released a warning in 2012 about cases of apparent short-term cognitive impairment with statin use, while acknowledging that the cardiovascular benefits outweigh their risks. However, systematic reviews have shown insufficient evidence on the impact of statins and research has shown mixed results, with some showing a neurocognitive benefit of statins and others reporting a null effect. According to the researchers of this study, since statins are widely used among older adults and expected to increase in use, determining the effects of statin therapy on cognition in older individuals is vital to help clinicians weigh their benefits against associated risks. “With statins being increasingly prescribed to older adults, their potential long-term effects on cognitive decline and dementia risk have attracted growing interest,” said Zhen Zhou, PhD, Menzies Institute for Medical Research at the University of Tasmania in Australia and lead author of the study. “The present study adds to previous research by suggesting that statin use at baseline was not associated with subsequent dementia incidence and long-term cognitive decline in older adults.” Researchers of this study analyzed data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. ASPREE was a large prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial of daily low-dose aspirin, which included 19,114 participants 65 years old or older with no prior CVD event, dementia or major physical disability, between 2010 and 2014 from Australia and the U.S. One of the key selection criteria of ASPREE was that participants had to have a score of <78 for the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination test, a screening test for cognitive abilities, at enrollment.",systematic reviews have shown insufficient evidence on the impact of statins,no,"

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63035-2," In fact, we identified that statin effects varied in quality, strength and appearance depending on user age. Specifically, statins improved reaction time in older persons and fluid intelligence in both age groups, while leading to a working memory decline in middle-aged users.A concern when considering variable outcomes of studies of statin cognitive effects is weaknesses in study design, specifically a confounding effect through reverse causation and selection bias (extensively discussed in Power et al.3). Reverse causation could result from including subjects with already prevalent cognitive impairment or from drop-out of statin users that discontinued their medication. In both cases, the cognitive status of the individuals might have an influence on their statin use rather than their statin use having an influence on cognitive function. Also, in both cases, this could result in false positive results on statin beneficial effects or false negative results on statin detrimental effects. In order to avoid such bias, we only included subjects without disease background that could account for cognitive problems, and excluded statin discontinuers from the time of discontinuation.",Reverse causation could result from including subjects with already prevalent cognitive impairment,neutral,"

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-016-0877-8," Several case reports and case series have suggested a potential association between statins and cognitive impairment [2].With the increased diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, the prescription of statins has also increased. Because cholesterol is heavily implicated as a causative factor in the formation of amyloid plaques, a reduction in cholesterol formation is postulated to slow plaque formation [3]. Statins are also reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. There are several studies and meta-analyses [3] confirming the benefits of statin use on cognitive impairment.Within the population receiving statins, there is a high proportion with memory loss and associated cognitive symptoms owing to the strong correlation of vascular risk factors, like diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, with vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia. Statins are used to control vascular risk factors that may contribute to dementia, and there is emerging evidence that statins may play a protective role in improving memory problems in dementia [4, 5]. However, there is also increasing concern that statins may be a causative factor for cognitive problems, mainly memory problems [2], although this has not yet been reported as a side effect in the British National Formulary.The postulation that statins can cause cognitive decline is based on the fact that lipophilic statins like atorvastatin and simvastatin show increased crossing of the blood–brain barrier compared to hydrophilic statins (for example, pravastatin and rosuvastatin).",statins can cause cognitive decline,neutral,"

Examination of the FDA postmarketing surveillance databases revealed a low reporting rate for cognitive-related adverse events with statins that was similar to the rates seen with other commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications.Limitations:The absence of many well-powered RCTs for most outcomes resulted in final strengths of evidence that were low or moderate. Imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias also limited the strength of findings.Conclusion:Larger and better-designed studies are needed to draw unequivocal conclusions about the effect of statins on cognition.

However, they admitted that none of the major randomized trials with statins that they had reviewed systematically looked for cognitive decline and that the symptom could have been subtle. Therefore, the researchers concluded that no definitive statement about statins and memory problems could be made one way or the other. Another major review of research published in 2021 looked at 24 studies that included 1,404,459 people to see if statin use was linked to cognitive impairment. The researchers concluded that ""there was no evidence of adverse cognitive effects, including [the] incidence of dementia, deterioration in global cognition, or specific cognitive domains associated with statin use in individuals aged ≥60 years,"" but that ""studies should examine this association in studies with longer follow-up periods.""

Does Vitamin C prevent colds?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/," Some of the participants took the vitamin C over a period of several years.Research resultsThe studies showed that it wasn't possible to prevent colds by taking vitamin C every day over a longer period of time. But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. These results have now been confirmed by other researchers as well, especially regarding use in children. It didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women who started taking it only after they became ill.Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in connection with extremely cold temperatures.

Overall, experts have found little to no benefit from vitamin C for preventing or treating the common cold. In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shortened cold duration -- by 8% in adults and by 14% in children.In 2010, researchers looked at all studies and found that taking vitamin C every day did not prevent the number of colds that a person got.

For comparison, the RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.At that time, no reliable studies had proved this to be true.But in the following few decades, multiple randomized controlled studies examined whether the vitamin had any effect on the common cold.The results have been fairly disappointing.An analysis of 29 studies including 11,306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of catching a cold (1).However, regular vitamin C supplements had several benefits, including:Reduced cold severity: They reduced the symptoms of a cold, making it less severe.Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.A supplemental dose of 1–2 grams was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18% in children, on average (1).Other studies in adults have found 6–8 grams per day to be effective (2).Vitamin C appears to have even stronger effects in people who are under intense physical stress. In marathon runners and skiers, vitamin C alantost halved the duration of the common cold (1).Summary Although vitamin C supplements have no effect on the risk of catching a cold, they appear to reduce its severity and duration.How Does Vitamin C Reduce the Severity of Colds?Vitamin C is an antioxidant and necessary to produce collagen in the skin.Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, keeping skin and various tissues tough but flexible.A vitamin C deficiency results in a condition known as scurvy, which isn’t really a problem today, as most people get enough vitamin C from foods.However, it’s less known that vitamin C is also highly concentrated in immune cells and quickly depleted during an infection (3).In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens the immune system and increases the risk of infections (4).For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during an infection is a good idea.Summary Vitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells. It is depleted during infections, so a vitamin C deficiency may increase their risk.Other Nutrients and Foods That May HelpThere is no cure for the common cold.However, some foods and nutrients can help the body recover.",HelpThere is no cure for the common cold,neutral,"

Does vitamin C help prevent colds? According to a study published in the journal Nutrition , vitamin C helps maintain the integrity of the epithelial barriers in our bodies (which are all surfaces that prevent any external pollutants from entering our bodies) such as the skin and intestinal walls. Vitamin C also helps protect our skin from pathogens by strengthening its structure and enhancing its ability to ""scrape"" free radicals, and boosts our immune system's ability to detect and destroy microbes before they begin to pose a threat to our health. So in theory, vitamin C should protect us from these minor respiratory infections.

Mechanistically, it makes sense: vitamin C helps immune cells form and function, and it supports the physical barriers (such as the epithelial cells of your skin) that protect you from pathogens.

(Getty Images)There's been such enthusiastic support for some of the early findings of studies about coffee's role in weight loss that there's now a diet plan called the coffee lover's diet, which is laid out in a book of the same name by Dr. Bob Arnot, a physician and bestselling author of numerous diet and wellness books. That diet encourages drinking at least three cups of light-roast coffee per day, while restricting calories with an eating plan that looks a bit like the Mediterranean diet to lose weight.Other high-profile celebrity diet gurus have also recently pushed green coffee bean extract, a pill-based supplement, to help people lose weight. A 2017 study conducted in Iran found that women with obesity who took 400 milligrams per day of this supplement for eight weeks while following a low-calorie diet lost more weight than those on the same diet who did not take the extract. The extract comes from unroasted green coffee beans and contains caffeine and other components of coffee that may promote weight loss. The use of this supplement has been deemed a fad by some nutritionists.However, there is something to the idea that coffee and its constituent components could help support weight loss.“There have been various studies looking at the effects of coffee consumption for weight loss,” says Katherine Mitchell, an oncology dietitian at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G.

Coffee is a great way to start your morning and the hot mug warms up your hands when it’s cold outside. But could the caffeine in that cup also help you lose weight? Claims of Weight Loss With Caffeine  

When it comes to the connection between caffeine and weight loss, there are three common claims:



Research suggests that consuming caffeine can jumpstart your metabolism and help you burn fat. One study, for example, found that in the three hours after consuming coffee, metabolic rates were significantly higher in those who drank coffee than those who did not. Another common belief is that caffeine boosts your energy level. The theory here is that the energy boost will make you more motivated to exercise, help you exercise for a longer time, or both.", caffeine,neutral,"

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://coffeegems.co.uk/blogs/blog/is-coffee-good-for-weight-loss," The evidence is not straightforward, as the impact of coffee on weight loss can vary depending on how it is consumed. Carried by curiosity, we explored different ways in which a cup of coffee can potentially support weight loss, as well as some potential risks. How coffee contributes to losing weight:
Caffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that increases your metabolic rate by boosting your body's production of adrenaline. This results in a temporary increase in your heart rate and the amount of energy your body burns, even when you're at rest. This can help you burn more calories throughout the day, leading to weight loss. Appetite suppression: Caffeine can suppress your appetite by altering the levels of certain hormones in your body, such as ghrelin and leptin.",a cup of coffee can potentially support weight loss,yes,"

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/four-cups-of-coffee-modest-loss-of-body-fat/," Previous observational studies have linked drinking coffee with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, yet coffee’s effects on blood sugar metabolism have not been well defined. In the current study, coffee did not affect the study participants’ sensitivity to insulin – the hormone that regulates sugar levels in the blood. The study did yield an unexpected result: Drinking coffee was associated with a modest loss of body fat. According to a January 13, 2020 HealthDay News article, Derrick Alperet, a study coauthor and research fellow in the Department of Nutrition, and colleagues think that the fat loss may be due to the caffeine in coffee increasing the drinker’s metabolism, which may burn more calories and cause a decrease in body fat.

According to Healthline, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to weight loss. However, it can be used as a low-calorie replacement in place of a high-calorie beverage. This can potentially promote weight loss. As for the other health benefits of lemon water, not only does it keep you hydrated, it also works wonders for the skin.

"
Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-water-for-weight-loss," Drinking it instead of higher-calorie beverages could help contribute to weight loss.It Can Keep You Hydrated From carrying nutrients to cells to transporting waste out of the body, drinking enough water to stay hydrated is a critical component of health.Maintaining adequate hydration is essential in everything from regulating body temperature to improving physical performance (5).Some evidence also suggests that staying hydrated can aid in weight loss.Research indicates that increased hydration may increase the breakdown of fats and enhance fat loss (6).Staying well-hydrated may also help reduce water retention, which can cause symptoms like bloating, puffiness and weight gain (7).Since the majority of lemon water is made up of water, it can help with maintaining adequate hydration.Summary: Drinking lemon water could help you stay hydrated, which reduces water retention and may increase fat loss.Drinking Lemon Water May Boost Metabolism Studies show that drinking enough water can potentially help increase your metabolism.Researchers suggest that good hydration enhances the function of mitochondria, a type of organelle found in cells that helps generate energy for the body (6).This leads to an increase in metabolism, which may lead to subsequent weight loss.Drinking water has also been shown to increase metabolism by inducing thermogenesis, a metabolic process in which calories are burned to produce heat.In one study, 14 participants drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water. Drinking water was found to increase their metabolic rate by 30% for 30–40 minutes (8).Another study looked at the effects of drinking water in 21 overweight children. Drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased metabolism by an impressive 25% for 40 minutes (9).Research on lemon water specifically is limited. However, because water is the main ingredient, it likely carries the same metabolism-boosting benefits as regular water.Summary: Studies show that drinking water could increase metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function and inducing thermogenesis.Lemon Water Can Make You Feel More Full Drinking water is often recommended as a fundamental part of any weight loss regimen, as it can promote satiety and fullness without adding calories.A 2008 study looked at the effects of water on calorie intake in 24 overweight and obese older adults.The study revealed that drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before breakfast decreased the number of calories consumed in the meal by 13% (10).Another study found that drinking water with a meal decreased hunger and increased satiety during the meal (11).Because lemon water is low in calories and can promote fullness in the same way as regular water, it can be an effective way to help reduce calorie intake.Summary: Regular water and lemon water can help promote satiety and fullness, which may decrease calorie intake and lead to weight loss.It Could Increase Weight Loss Due to its potential beneficial effects on metabolism, satiety and hydration, some evidence suggests that water (including lemon water) could enhance weight loss.In one study, 48 adults were assigned to two diets: a low-calorie diet with 16.9 oz (0.5 liters) of water prior to each meal or a low-calorie diet with no water before meals.At the end of the 12-week study, participants in the water group had lost 44% more weight than participants in the non-water group (12).Other research suggests that increasing water intake could help stimulate weight loss, independent of diet or exercise.A 2009 study measured water intake in 173 overweight women. It found that greater water intake was associated with a greater loss of body weight and fat over time, regardless of diet or physical activity (13).Though these studies focus specifically on regular water, the same results most likely apply to lemon water as well.Summary: Some studies suggest that drinking regular water or lemon water could increase weight loss, regardless of diet or exercise.Lemon Water Is Not Necessarily Better Than Regular Water Lemon water comes with a lot of potential benefits, from promoting hydration to increasing satiety.However, it’s important to note that these benefits all come from its main ingredient — water.Lemon water does contain some additional nutrients from the lemon juice, such as vitamin C and antioxidants, but these are unlikely to have any effect on your weight.Additionally, the alkalizing effect of lemon juice has no clear effects on weight.All that being said, lemon water may have some benefits for preventing kidney stones, due to the acids it contains (14, 15, 16) Summary: Lemon water may be beneficial for weight loss, but has no added benefits over regular water.How to Drink Lemon Water Lemon water is a highly customizable beverage and can be tailored based on personal preference.Recipes usually call for the juice from at least half a lemon mixed with a glass of water. To add more flavor, try adding in a few other ingredients.A few fresh mint leaves or a sprinkle of turmeric are delicious and healthy ways to spice up a glass of lemon water.Many people prefer to start their day with a refreshing glass of lemon water, but it can be enjoyed at any time of day.It can also be consumed hot, like tea, or with a few ice cubes added for a cool and invigorating drink.Despite claims that lemon water has greater benefits when consumed at certain temperatures, there is little evidence to support that it makes a difference.Summary: Lemon water can be customized based on personal preference, and it can be enjoyed hot or cold at any time of day.The Bottom Line Lemon water can promote fullness, support hydration, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.However, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to losing fat.That being said, it is tasty, easy to make and can be used as a low-calorie replacement for higher-calorie beverages.In this way, it could potentially help promote weight loss and improve health.How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Share this articleBy Rachael Link, MS, RD on June 11, 2017Read this nextCarbonated (Sparkling) Water: Good or Bad?By Franziska SpritzlerCarbonated (sparkling) water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas.",greater loss,neutral,"

Some of the energy expenditure was from heating the water to body temperature.¹¹When you drink cooler water, your body expends even more energy to heat it, so drinking a cool glass of lemon water regularly throughout the day could increase your metabolism, leading to weight loss.Lemon water helps you stay hydrated throughout the day, promoting weight loss by inducing increased lipolysis (fat breakdown). Animal studies have consistently shown that increasing hydration results in enhanced mitochondrial activity in fat cells, which causes lipolysis.¹²The lemon extract itself may also aid weight loss by suppressing weight gain and fat accumulation. Studies in mice on a high-fat diet showed that weight gain, fat accumulation, high cholesterol, high sugar levels, and insulin resistance were all significantly suppressed by lemon polyphenols.¹³Hesperidin, a flavonoid found in lemons, has been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism by lowering the production of VLDL, a bad type of cholesterol, and serum triglycerides.¹⁴ Triglycerides are essentially the extra calories you consume that you don’t burn, which are then stored in your fat cells. Reducing triglycerides assists with both weight loss and overall health.

Nicholas Deeter, DO, Ridgeview Clinics, shares that, “Processed meats are to colon cancer what smoking is to lung cancer.” Processed meats are known carcinogens. In fact, they are classified in the same group of carcinogens (Group 1) as tobacco and alcohol by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A diet high in red meats and processed meats—like bacon, hot dogs and deli meat—can raise your colorectal cancer risk significantly. To lower your risk, Dr. Deeter recommends eating less or no processed meats, likewise for red meat. “If giving up red meat is not realistic for you, start with small changes like cutting it out of your meals one day a week, eating smaller, three to four-ounce, portion sizes, and choosing local, organic, grass-fed meat,” he added.",—can raise your colorectal cancer risk significantly,neutral,"

Red meat, such as beef, lamb and pork, has been classified as a Group 2A carcinogen which means it probably causes cancer. Did you know if you’ve had cancer, maintaining a healthy diet can help prevent it from coming back? How red and processed meat increase cancer risk  Current research shows that there are certain chemicals in red and processed meats – both added and naturally occurring – that cause these foods to be carcinogenic. For example, when a chemical in red meat called haem is broken down in the gut, N-nitroso chemicals are formed and these have been found to damage the cells that line the bowel, which can lead to bowel cancer.

Although previous findings suggest that every 50 grams of processed meat a person eats daily increases his or her bowel cancer risk, the results of this study lowered the number of grams to 25 a day. “Our results strongly suggest that people who eat red and processed meat four or more times a week have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than those who eat red and processed meat less than twice a week,” said coauthor Tim Key, Cancer Research UK’s expert in diet and deputy director at the University of Oxford’s cancer epidemiology unit. According to Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, this doesn’t mean that people need to cut processed and red meat from their diets entirely.

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://utswmed.org/medblog/cancer-processed-meat/," If you ate hot dogs and bologna regularly as a kid (many of us did), that doesn’t automatically mean you’re doomed to develop colon cancer. However, if you ate lots of processed meat, very little vegetables and fruit, and grew up never exercising, that combination of bad habits will likely increase your risk for developing colon cancer. The risk increases further if you have a genetic disposition for the disease.That said, our lifelong dietary habits do affect our health as we age. You may have some cellular-level damage to your colon from years of eating processed meats. The chemicals in processed meat coat your colon and damage the cells.

Bacon intake was particularly associated with risk of colon cancer (proximal and distal) in women.The estimation of cancer risk associated with meat may be influenced by other dietary factors, as shown clearly in the “dietary pattern” studies cited above (20–22). In those studies, the intake of processed meat was associated with intake of French fries (or potatoes), sweets, cakes, desserts, snacks and alcoholic beverages: These high glycemic index diets, and alcohol intake, may be risk factors for colorectal cancer. In addition, high-meat diets have been negatively associated with food groups rich in antioxidants and fiber, components which have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (4).

Red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork – is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, and can form part of a balanced diet. But eating a lot of red and processed meat increases your risk of bowel (colorectal) cancer.That's why it's recommended that people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day cut down to 70g or less. This could help reduce your risk of bowel cancer.Other healthier lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a healthy weight, keeping active and not smoking can also reduce your risk.

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/03/report-says-eating-processed-meat-is-carcinogenic-understanding-the-findings/," At this point there is insufficient data to conclude whether those meats are safer than the “non-organic” meats. The media has reported that 50g/day consumption of processed meat can risk for colorectal cancer from an average 5 percent lifetime risk to 6 percent. This does not sound like much of an increase in risk. 50g processed meat is equivalent to about 6 slices of bacon or one hot dog. The 5 percent to 6 percent increase in risk of colorectal cancer reported in the media is a population average, but this estimate does not take into account that for certain subgroups (e.g., those who are also obese, are physically inactive or consume diets high in sugar, saturated fat etc., or are more genetically susceptible) the absolute risk can be higher. As mentioned above, high consumption of red and processed meat is associated with higher risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, not just colorectal cancers and high processed meat consumption is estimated to account for about 644,000 deaths worldwide.",This does not sound like much of an increase in risk,neutral,"

Can oil pulling heal cavities?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-benefits-of-oil-pulling," Could help reduce bad breathHalitosis, also known as bad breath, is a condition that affects an estimated 50% of the population (5).There are many potential causes of bad breath.Some of the most common include infection, gum disease, poor oral hygiene, and tongue coating, which is when bacteria become trapped on the tongue (9).Treatment typically includes the removal of the bacteria, either through brushing or by using an antiseptic mouthwash like chlorhexidine (10).Interestingly, one 2011 study found that oil pulling was as effective as chlorhexidine at reducing bad breath.In the study, 20 children rinsed with either chlorhexidine or sesame oil, both of which caused a significant decrease in levels of the microorganisms known to contribute to bad breath (11).Though more research is needed, oil pulling may be used as a natural alternative to reduce bad breath and could be as effective as traditional treatments.3. May help prevent cavitiesCavities are a common problem that stems from tooth decay.Poor oral hygiene, eating too much sugar, and a buildup of bacteria can all cause tooth decay, which leads to the formation of holes in the teeth known as cavities (4).Plaque can also cause cavities. Plaque forms a coating on teeth and is comprised of bacteria, saliva, and food particles. The bacteria begin to break down the food particles, forming an acid that destroys tooth enamel and causes tooth decay (4).Several studies have found that oil pulling can help reduce the number of bacteria in the mouth, preventing tooth decay.In fact, some research has found that oil pulling may decrease the number of harmful bacteria found in saliva and plaque as effectively as a mouthwash (7, 8).Decreasing these strains of bacteria through oil pulling could help prevent tooth decay and reduce the risk of cavity formation.4. Seems to reduce inflammation and improve gum healthGingivitis is a type of gum disease marked by red, swollen gums that bleed easily.The bacteria found in plaque are a major cause of gingivitis, as they can cause bleeding and inflammation in the gums (12).Fortunately, oil pulling may be an effective remedy to improve gum health and reduce inflammation.It works primarily by decreasing the harmful bacteria and plaque in the mouth that contribute to gum disease, such as Streptococcus mutans.Using certain oils with anti-inflammatory properties like coconut oil may also aid by reducing the inflammation associated with gum disease (13).In one study, 60 participants with gingivitis began oil pulling with coconut oil for 30 days. After 1 week, they had reduced amounts of plaque and showed an improvement in gum health (14).Another older study in 20 boys with gingivitis compared the effectiveness of oil pulling with sesame oil and a standard mouthwash.Both groups showed a decrease in plaque, an improvement in gingivitis, and a reduction in the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth (15).While more evidence is needed, these findings suggest that oil pulling may be an effective supplementary treatment to prevent plaque formation and promote healthy gums.5.",Decreasing these strains of bacteria through oil pulling could help prevent tooth decay,yes,"

Can oil pulling heal cavities?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198813/," ConclusionOil pulling is observed to bring improvement in oral hygiene when practiced correctly and regularly. Limited available research on effect of oil pulling on oral hygiene shows promising benefits of oil pulling procedure on oral cavity. However oil pulling does not replace dental therapy and is currently not recommended by American dental association.35 Extensive research on the role of this traditional, cheap and valuable remedy should be encouraged without bias. Based on currently available research it can be concluded that oil pulling when performed as recommended, can be safely used as an adjunct to maintain good oral hygiene and health along with the routine tooth brushing and flossing with promising positive results.Conflict of interestThere is no conflict of interest.FootnotesPeer review under responsibility of The Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University.References1.

Can oil pulling heal cavities?,https://www.valleyoakdentalgroup.com/oil-pulling-and-your-teeth-3-things-you-should-know," Adolescents who practiced oil pulling for 30 days exhibited a statistically significant decrease in gingival indices.However, researchers have not proven whether oil pulling removes enough bacteria to decrease the risk of cavities, nor have they compared the effectiveness to the brushing and flossing. While oil pulling could work well for those with relatively healthy teeth and gums, the technique doesn’t present a reliable cure for gingivitis and gum disease.In severe infections, the gums inflame, swell, and pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that even more bacteria can hide. As gingivitis progresses, these pockets increase from a healthy two or three millimeter depth to a four or five millimeter depth (or more).As the oils slide along the gum’s surface, they likely won’t fight or remove plaque lodged deep within the gums. Only a professional scaling (scraping) and root planning can clean tartar from below the gum line, so don’t skip out on your dentist appointment just yet. 3. It May Lead to Side Effects

With that in mind, it should be no surprise that recent studies have shown the benefit of coconut oil in the prevention of tooth decay.There is no question that oil pulling lessens the bacterial load in the mouth. As we all know, the mouth is the gateway to the body. When you consider the fact that a clean mouth may have between 1,000 and 100,000 bacteria on each tooth, and those that do not have a clean mouth may have between 100 million and a billion bacteria on each tooth, surely oil pulling can’t hurt?

Can oil pulling heal cavities?,https://askthedentist.com/oil-pulling-coconut-oil/," Oil pulling may help prevent and reverse cavities. By supporting a balance of good-to-bad bacteria in the mouth, oil pulling may help remineralize teeth and play a part in reversing cavities naturally. Your teeth are designed to rebuild (remineralize) themselves on an ongoing basis, but this remineralization is only possible in the presence of the proper nutrients and the absence of cavity-causing bacteria. Overgrowth of harmful bacteria in your mouth, such as Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), can lead to cavities, or “dental caries.”
Oil pulling with both sesame and coconut oils eliminates excessive S. mutans within the mouth just as effectively as the chlorhexidine found in prescription mouthwash. This effect only seems to occur after at least three weeks, though—just one reason why coconut oil pulling should be used as a long-term dental health solution, not a quick fix. While diet is key to healing cavities, coconut oil pulling might also play a useful role by correcting dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and keeping S. mutans in check.",oil pulling may help remineralize teeth,yes,"

GeneralThere is currently a lot of information online and in health magazines about the oral health benefits of “oil pulling”.“Oil pulling” involves swishing your mouth out with some type of edible oil (usually coconut or sesame oil).The technique is similar to how you would ordinarily use mouthwash; however with oil pulling it’s recommended that you swish the oil in your mouth for up to 5 to 20 minutes.Seems like a lot of time and effort, doesn’t it?Proponents of oil pulling claim that it has the following benefits to your oral health:Oil pulling can prevent tooth decay and cavities.It can fight gingivitis (help look after your gums).It can whiten your teeth.It can reduce bad breath.List of claimed benefits of oil pulling according to DrJockers.comNaturally, big claims require big evidence, so let’s take a look at how far we can actually say that oil pulling can have any of these oral health benefits.1) Oil pulling can prevent cavities.Those who say that that oil pulling can help prevent cavities and tooth decay claim that the oil can kill the harmful plaque bacteria that cause these problems.There actually have been a couple of clinical studies on this.Both studies suggested that oil pulling can reduce the amount of harmful bacteria in someone’s mouth, and that the extent to which it can do this is similar to regular mouthwash.Both of the studies claim that the active, anti-bacterial ingredient in the oils is lauric acid.The oil with the highest quantities of lauric acid is coconut oil.Therefore coconut oil is the best oil to use for oil pulling, as far as preventing tooth decay is concerned.Despite this, it is also very important to remember that the mechanical removal of bacteria is far more effective than trying to kill the bacteria with chemicals.This means that brushing is far more important in preventing tooth decay and cavities than any type of mouthwash (oil or otherwise) will ever be.Dentist’s verdict: Oil pulling can complement daily brushing to help prevent tooth decay, but it certainly is not essential and definitely should not be seen as the most important factor in preventing cavities. If you are to use oil pulling for this purpose, you should use coconut oil as it has high concentrations of lauric acid, which is the ingredient that actually reduces the amount of harmful bacteria in your mouth.2) Oil pulling can fight gingivitis and protect you from gum disease.Gingivitis is caused by plaque bacteria getting under the gum line.This is supported by the same theory that underlies the claim that oil pulling can help fight against tooth decay.Proponents of oil pulling argue that when you swish your mouth out with oil, it can get underneath your gum line and reduce the amount of inflammation-causing bacteria in contact with your gums.Again, there are a very small number of clinical studies supporting this.The active ingredient in the oil with regards to fighting gingivitis is, again, lauric acid.Therefore, the best oil to use for oil pulling (as far as looking after your gums is concerned) is coconut oil.Once more, it is important to stress that the bacteria that causes gum inflammation is far less resistant to mechanical, rather than chemical cleaning.Therefore oil pulling should not be seen as an alternative to flossing, rather it should complement regular flossing.Additionally, if you have symptoms of gum disease such as receding gums, or gums that regularly bleed during brushing, it is best to see a dentist or periodontist about this.Dentist’s verdict: Oil pulling with coconut oil can help with more mild forms of gingivitis when used in conjunction with flossing. This is (again) due to the lauric acid in coconut oil. It should not be seen as a way of treating more serious gum disease or as a replacement of flossing.3) Oil pulling can whiten your teeth.Most of the “evidence” for the ability of oil pulling to whiten your teeth comes from “before and after” shots of people’s teeth along with the claim that these results were achieved by oil pulling.Before and after photo of 49 day oil pulling treatment. Taken from this video.The above photo is an example of this.Please note that the video that this comes from is trying to sell oil pulling products…so make of that what you will.The best way to measure how far oil pulling can whiten your teeth is through clinically controlled studies comparing the changes in tooth shade of a group of people who do oil pulling against a group of people who do not.All other variables that may affect tooth shade, such as what people eat and drink, their other oral hygiene habits, and even how they breathe when asleep, need to be controlled.Currently, no such clinical study exists, so we will have to make do with evaluating the mechanism to which oil pulling can (apparently) whiten your teeth.Tooth stains can be broadly categorised into three groups:1) Extrinsic stains: these are stains to the outer surface of your tooth (enamel) usually caused by certain foods, drinks and smoking.2) Intrinsic stains: these are stains of the dentin, a tissue which lies below the enamel. This is usually caused by trauma.3) Age related stains: as you age enamel thins and dentin naturally darkens, the combination of this leads to darkened teeth as you get older.Now as oil pulling involves bathing the outer layer of your teeth in oil, it could only possibly fight extrinsic staining.The only possible way that oil pulling can lift these stains is if the stains are “fat-soluble”.If this is the case, then extended contact with oil may dissolve some of the stains off your teeth.So is there any evidence that extrinsic tooth stains are “fat-soluble”?Well let’s use the example of three common substances that cause extrinsic tooth staining: red wine, coffee and tobacco.In coffee and wine, the staining substance is tannin.",Oil pulling can prevent cavities,yes,"

no.

Here are some home remedies to prevent tooth cavities.1. Oil pullingOil pulling originated in an ancient system of alternative medicine called Ayurveda. It involves swishing a tablespoon of sesame or coconut oil around the mouth for around 20 minutes, then spitting it out. While some claims about oil pulling are not scientifically validated, research indicates that it can improve tooth health.

      Increasing fiber in the diet is one easy, straightforward lifestyle modification that can help prevent hemorrhoids. Fiber bulks up the stool, helping to keep you regular. It also works to prevent constipation, a significant risk factor for enlarged, painful hemorrhoids. Currently, it is recommended that women consume 25 grams per day, while men need around 38 grams per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods.

Eating a balanced diet, rich in fiber, is one of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make for your hemorrhoids. A balanced, high-fiber diet, together with plenty of fluids, softens the stool and increases its bulk, which will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids or worsen symptoms from existing hemorrhoids.

The Benefits of Fiber
Fiber prevents hemorrhoids in that it promotes healthy, regular bowel movements and relieves constipation. When we experience constipation, we are more likely to push and strain the area around the anus – which can lead to hemorrhoids. Since our bodies can’t break it down as easily as other nutrients, fiber increases the density and softness of our stools. This makes it easier for the matter to be pushed through the digestive tract.",it can certainly decrease your uncomfortable hemorrhoid symptoms,neutral,"

    Misconception
  Common misconceptions about fiber include the belief that eating too much fiber causes you to experience more hemorrhoids, and that too much fiber causes difficult or excess bowel movements. The actual cause of these problems is constipation, the result of eating too much fiber without increasing your water intake. Fiber adds bulk to your stool and absorbs water, which makes it easier to move along your digestive tract. If you do not have enough fluids in your system, your stool dries out, you become constipated and increase your risk of hemorrhoids, or worsen an existing hemorrhoid problem. Advertisement

Does a high fiber diet help with hemorrhoids?,https://www.trybonny.com/blogs/full-of-it-blog/hemorrhoids-prevention-and-fiber," Hemorrhoids High Fiber Diet 
For those who are unfamiliar with the H word, hemorrhoids are inflamed, swollen veins surrounding the anus or in the lower rectum, where the waste collects before it passes on as stool. Saturday Night Live / Via media.giphy.com
Though hemorrhoids, also called “piles,” aren’t typically a dangerous medical condition, they are extremely painful. There are two different kinds of hemorrhoids: internal and external hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids suck a little less than external hemorrhoids because they are typically painless. What you eat can help you ease the symptoms of hemorrhoids or even help you avoid them altogether.

Does a high fiber diet help with hemorrhoids?,https://troygastro.com/2021/10/21/things-to-eat-to-avoid-or-help-treat-hemorrhoids/," About half of the adults who are over 50 will have to deal with hemorrhoids at some time. Whether you want to try to prevent hemorrhoids, or are treating them, eating high fiber foods can make a difference. How can changing your diet help with hemorrhoid symptoms? For many people, eating more low fat, high fiber, and whole-grain foods helps prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids. Eating more fiber can provide several benefits including:

Increasing stool weight helps reduce the time it spends in the colon
Fiber increases water retention in the colon which results in softer stools that are easier to pass
It also decreases the pH levels in the colon which helps pass foods through the colon more quickly

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required that some prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs generally taken by mouth include warnings against drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit while taking the drug. Here are examples of some types of drugs that grapefruit juice can cause problems (interact) with:
Some statin drugs to lower cholesterol, such as Zocor (simvastatin) and Lipitor (atorvastatin). Some drugs that treat high blood pressure, such as Procardia and Adalat CC (both nifedipine).

Grapefruit's culprit chemical does not interact directly with your pills. Instead, it binds to an enzyme in your intestinal tract known as CYP3A4, which reduces the absorption of certain medications. When grapefruit juice blocks the enzyme, it's easier for the medication to pass from your gut to your bloodstream.

Can grapefruit interfere with medication?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589309/," The current trend of increasing numbers of newly marketed grapefruit-affected drugs possessing substantial adverse clinical effects necessitates an understanding of this interaction and the application of this knowledge for the safe and effective use of drugs in general practice.Key points
Currently, more than 85 drugs have the possibility of interacting with grapefruit; of these drugs, 43 have interactions that can result in serious adverse effects. Drugs that interact with grapefruit have all of the following characteristics: they are administered orally, they have very low to intermediate absolute bioavailability, and they are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4). All sources of grapefruit and certain related citrus fruits can irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4 in the gastrointestinal tract; to prevent this interaction, affected drugs should not be consumed with any of these fruits during the treatment period, or noninteracting alternative medications should be prescribed. Older patients have the greatest possibility of ingesting grapefruit and interacting medications and are the most vulnerable to the adverse clinical consequences.Supplementary Material

There's evidence that they can be effective.A 2021 review found people who used e-cigarettes to quit smoking, as well as having expert face-to-face support, can be up to twice as likely to succeed as people who used other nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum.Using an e-cigarette can help you manage your nicotine cravings. To get the best out of it, make sure you're using it as much as you need to and with the right strength of nicotine in your e-liquid.You will not get the full benefit from vaping unless you stop smoking cigarettes completely.Getting expert help from your local Stop Smoking Service gives you the best chance of quitting smoking for good.Find your local Stop Smoking ServiceHow do I choose the right e-cigarette for me?There are different types of e-cigarette, including vape pens, vape bars, pod devices, mods, and cigalikes.

People living with diabetes are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (29, 30, 31, 32). Unlike refined sugar products such as candy and cake, the carbs in fruits like bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (33).For most people with diabetes, fruits — including bananas — are a healthy choice.However, some people who are following low carb diets need to watch their total carbohydrate intake to stay within their daily carb allotment. This means foods higher in carbs, including bananas, have to be limited on low carb diets.If your doctor says you can eat bananas, it’s important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of a banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.SummaryFruits like bananas are healthy foods that contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

The radiofrequency EMF given off by Wi-Fi is a type of non-ionizing radiation. The level of radiofrequency EMF emitted from a Wi-Fi device must comply with the Canadian standards established for radiocommunication devices. Health effects of Wi-Fi
There are no health risks from exposure to radiofrequency EMF from Wi-Fi devices in your home, in schools or other areas accessible to the public. These devices must meet standards to ensure they do not exceed radiofrequency EMF exposure limits. While some of the radiofrequency EMF emitted by Wi-Fi is absorbed in your body, the amount largely depends on:

the strength of the signal
how close your body is to a Wi-Fi enabled device

Measurements of the radiofrequency EMF level from multiple Wi-Fi sources and Wi-Fi enabled devices operating at the same time in the same room were far below the human exposure limits in Safety Code 6. Based on the current scientific evidence the level of radiofrequency EMF emitted from Wi-Fi devices is not harmful to health.",There are no health risks,no,"

(Moskowitz has collected much of that research here.) He mentions neurodevelopmental issues, cancer, and reproductive harm—in both men and women—as some of those potential health concerns, especially for pregnant women and young children. The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified mobile phones as a “possible carcinogen,” which means there’s currently not enough research to say whether either causes cancer. Earlier this year, a rodent study found heavy exposures to cell phone radiation increased rats’ risks for some brain and heart tumors.

Is wifi harmful for health?,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10643389.2021.1951549," It is thus likely that complaints to have experienced detrimental effects when being exposed to WiFi are owing to a nocebo response. A recent experimental double-blind study using sham and real WiFi exposure demonstrated that negative expectations about the harmfulness of EMF may foster the occurrence of illusory symptom perceptions via alterations in the somatosensory decision criterion (Wolters et al., 2021).In conclusion, we found little evidence that WiFi exposure is a health risk in the everyday environment, where exposure levels are typically considerably lower than ICNIRP guideline values. Observational studies on long-term effects specifically focusing on WiFi are scarce and challenging to conduct given the little exposure contribution from WiFi to overall RF-EMF exposure. Experimental studies, although limited in numbers, did not provide evidence that WiFi exposure may be more problematic than other types of RF-EMF exposure in a similar frequency and intensity range, and it is justified to conduct health risk evaluation for WiFi based on the total RF-EMF literature. Given the fact that some people state to react to specific RF-EMF sources, we recommend further experimental studies aiming to clarify the exact role of the signal characteristics by systematically exploring different aspects of RF-EMF exposure such as frequency, signal characteristics and crest factors in addition to intensity and duration of exposure. A more systematic and concerted approach would provide more reliable information for risk assessment for specific RF-EMF sources or for new exposure situations like the ongoing introduction of the fifth generation mobile radio technology (5 G).",little evidence that WiFi exposure is a health risk in the everyday environment,yes,"

These human studies have tried to see whether heavy users of cell phones have higher rates of brain cancers and other health problems compared with people who use cell phones less often. All that research—in test tubes, animals, and humans—has been mixed, with no definitive proof that cell-phone radiation harms human health, but also unable to completely clear it of any potential risk. The research into the RF signals used with WiFi is even more preliminary, focused on lab and animal studies, making it even more difficult to reach firm conclusions about their safety or risk. But researchers can make some judgments about the potential for harm based on how WiFi and similar technologies work, as well as on how people tend to use their devices.

Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss," Timing insulin with food intake becomes a challenge because it is difficult to predict how long it will take for blood sugar to rise after a meal (5).Since apple cider vinegar has been shown to extend the time food stays in your stomach, taking it with meals could worsen gastroparesis (6).SummaryApple cider vinegar helps promote fullness, in part due to delayed stomach emptying. This may naturally lead to lower calorie intake. However, it could worsen gastroparesis for some.It may help you lose weight and body fatResults from a small but widely cited 2009 study indicate that apple cider vinegar has impressive effects on weight and body fat (7).In this 12-week study, 144 Japanese adults with obesity consumed either 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vinegar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, or a placebo drink every day.They were told to restrict their alcohol intake but otherwise continue their usual diet and activity throughout the study.Participants who consumed 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day had — on average — the following benefits:Weight loss: 2.6 pounds (lb), or 1.2 kilograms (kg)Decrease in body fat percentage: 18%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.5 inches (in), or 1.4 centimeters (cm)Decrease in triglycerides: 26%This is what changed in participants who consumed 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day:Weight loss: 4.2 lb, or 1.7 kgDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in, or 1.9 cmDecrease in triglycerides: 26%The placebo group actually gained 0.9 lb (0.4 kg), and their waist circumference slightly increased.In a 2018 clinical trial involving 39 participants on restricted calorie diets, those who consumed about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar (8).According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your body fat percentage, help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood triglycerides.These are two of only a few human studies that have investigated apple cider vinegar’s effects on weight loss. Although the results are encouraging, additional studies are needed.SummaryIn two studies, people with obesity who took 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost weight and body fat.Other health benefitsIn addition to promoting weight and fat loss, apple cider vinegar has several other benefits:Lowers blood sugar and insulin: When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating (4).Improves insulin sensitivity: Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal may improve insulin sensitivity (9).Lowers fasting blood sugar: Studies have found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (10).Improves polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms: In a small 2013 study of women with PCOS who took vinegar for 90–110 days, 57% resumed ovulation, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity (11).Decreases cholesterol levels: A 2021 research review of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides (12).Lowers blood pressure: Animal studies suggest that vinegar may decrease blood pressure by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for constricting blood vessels. However, human studies haven’t shown significant decreases in blood pressure (13, 14).Kills harmful bacteria and viruses: Studies show that apple cider vinegar may be a powerful fighter against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria as well as resistant Escherichia coli (rE.",may help you lose weight,neutral,"

Apple cider vinegar has been shown to be most effective when paired with a diet full of starchy foods, as the acid slows down the digestion of starch. This could potentially assist those looking to lose weight, because slow digestion keeps you feeling fuller, longer. There’s also some evidence that drinking apple cider vinegar before a starchy meal keeps your blood sugars stable, making you less likely to crave sweet snacks. But does apple cider vinegar actually work to help you lose weight? Johnston says it's worth trying—provided you're not looking for immediate results.9dreamstudioIf you eat whole foods with a high starch content, such potatoes or rice, you can try making apple cider vinegar a daily precursor to your meals.How much apple cider vinegar should you take?There is no official recommended dosage, because the research on apple cider vinegar use is limited.But Johnston recommends mixing one to two tablespoons with eight ounces of water to drink before meal time.",Apple cider vinegar has helped study participants lose weight,neutral,"

This makes it hard to pinpoint if and how ginger might help combat it.“You can't necessarily treat every single nausea with similar treatment,” he says.

   The Science Behind Ginger and Nausea  

Ginger for nausea works directly on the stomach and is thought to increase the movement of the GI tract. A 2005 report from Obstetrics and Gynecology analyzed six clinical trials (with a total of 675 participants) and found that ginger was superior to a placebo and similar to vitamin B6 in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.﻿﻿



In addition, in a 2006 report from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, investigators sized up five clinical trials (with a total of 363 patients) and concluded that taking ginger is more effective than placebo for post-surgery nausea and vomiting.﻿﻿



In 2012, another study reported in Integrated Cancer Therapy found that ginger was effective in reducing nausea caused by chemotherapy.
