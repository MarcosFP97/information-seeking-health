Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity. Ankle braces are not shown to reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower extremity injuries. Ankle ligaments, muscle and tendon units and the bones of your ankle create the internal supports to keep your ankle safe. These internal supports are important links from your foot all the way up to your hip for ideal performance. Ankle braces serve as the external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion (movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward),  and provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space.","lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity",neutral,"

You should definitely wear supportive Achilles tendonitis sandals as well as supportive slippers.How Long Should I Wear Heel Lifts?Unlike muscles or bones, which have good blood supply, tendons don’t have a great deal of blood supply. This is why Achilles tendonitis can take 12 weeks or more to heal after an injury.When you’re experiencing tendinopathy, you may want to try the heel lifts for a few hours at a time. If you find that you’re comfortable and the pain has eased up while wearing them, then extend the duration that you use them until you can wear them throughout the day.If you haven’t experienced any pain when using the heel lifts for a full day, then you can use them in your shoes for 6 to 12 weeks.However, if your pain increases, then you should stop using them and seek medical advice.How Do Heel Lifts Work?Heel lifts are usually a firm wedge that you place in the back of your shoes for achilles tendonitis to fit under your heel. This increases the height in the heel of the shoe, which then shortens the tendon and reduces the amount of strain that’s placed on it.Even though you may only have Achilles tendonitis in one ankle, you’ll need to place heel lifts in both shoes.This keeps your legs at the same height.",Wear a brace can help Achilles Tendonitis,yes,"

Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.donjoyperformance.com/injury/achilles-tendonitis," The achilles tendon connects your heel to your calf and helps with movement and flexing of the foot. Achilles Tendonitis is inflammation of the achilles tendon and is often caused by overuse, increasing activity too quickly, tight calf muscles, or flat feet. If you are injured, the area on the back of your foot above your heel may hurt, your achilles may feel tender or tight, and it might be difficult for you to move your foot. Severe injuries can involve the rupture of your achilles tendon, you might hear and feel a pop when this occurs and you may experience severe pain. Aside from the typical rest, ice, compression and elevation for your foot treatment, wearing a brace to support your achilles tendon and applying a compression sleeve to your calf can help alleviate pain.

   Q: Will a bath help bring down my baby's fever? A: Although in the past many people gave feverish kids baths to lower their temperature, doctors now say this isn't the wisest thing to do. When your child is sick and may already have the chills, stripping him naked and getting him wet will just make him shiver. Instead, try giving a dose of acetaminophen like Tylenol (for babies under 6 months) or ibuprofen like Motrin (for babies 6 months or older) -- but never a combination of both -- and placing a cool washcloth on your child's head to bring his fever down. Remember, most of the time a fever is nothing to fear, since it's actually a sign that your child's body is fighting off a virus or infection. So unless the fever is making your child visibly uncomfortable (meaning he's lost his appetite, is cranky, and can't sleep), there's really no need to try to bring it down.",doctors now say this isn't the wisest thing to do,neutral,"

By wiping the entire body of a child with a warm washcloth, heat evaporation is achieved by applying pressure to the skin, resulting in the sponge bath technique. It acts as a heat radiator to help regulate body temperature. Sweating is accelerated in sponge baths because warm water is rinsed all over the body and skin.

Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,https://nurseinfo.in/tepid-sponge-cold-sponge/," The temperature of water used for tepid sponge is 80-90 degree F.




PURPOSE
Tepid sponge helps to reduce the
temperature between 102 and 102.8 degree F. Cold sponge helps reduce the
temperature of above 103 degree F. To stimulate circulation To decrease toxicity Nervousness and delirium To soothe the nerves and promote
sleep 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
Cold sponging is used to reduce
temperature in a patient with hyperpyrexia Large areas of the body are sponged
at one time, permitting the heat of the body to transfer to the cooler solution
on the body surface. Often wet towels are applied to the
neck, axillae, groin and ankles, where the blood circulation is close to the
skin surface The vital signs are checked very
frequently to detect the early signs of complications The physiological effect of the cold
applications are vaso-constriction, decreased blood circulation, decreased
capillary permeability, decreased metabolism, decreased blood viscosity, etc. The application moist cold is more
effective than the application of dry cold as the moisture distributes the cold
to large and deep area There must be a written order for
tepid sponge or cold sponge Use long strokes for sponging and
avoid circular movements or friction while sponging Keep the hot water bag ready at the
foot end of the bed 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT 
Check 
The doctors order for any specific
instructions General condition and diagnosis Self-care ability of the patient Assess the duration of application For contraindication to cold
application Articles available in the unit 
PREPARATION OF THE PATIENT AND ENVIRONMENT 
Explain the sequence of the procedure
Provide privacy Check the initial temperature and
should be checked every 15 minutes intervals Position the patient comfortably in
the bed Remove the patient gown and place
with bath blanket Bring the patient to the edge of the
bed Place the long Mackintosh and draw
sheet under the patient Arrange the articles to the bedside 
PROCEDURE
Wash hands Mix the water with ice cubes Soak the wash cloths in the ice cold
water for some time Place cold sponge cloths in each
axial and groin Put the face towel under the head
sponge the face and dry with face towel Sponge the neck, right arm from the
shoulder to the finger tips for 3 minutes Change sponge cloth when it becomes
warm Sponge the left arm, chest and
abdomen for 3 minutes Change the water if it becomes dirty
and check the temperature Cover the upper half, of the body and
expose the lower half of the body Sponge the right and left lower limb
for 3 minutes Then carefully turn the patient for
his side and bring patient to edge of bed. Sponge the back with long strokes
for 3 minutes Dry the part with bath towel and
apply spirit on the back Check the temperature at 20 minutes
interval and record it in the TPR chart

Can Folic Acid Improve Cognitive Function? Folic acid has be used to treat people suffering from memory loss, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia for some time now. There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:

Improved memory
Better change in cognitive function
Significant difference in information processing 
Change in age-related cognitive issues
Improved mental function in older people

B Vitamins, Folic Acid Don’t Improve Memory, Cognitive Performance




                        November 14, 2014                    











HealthDay News — Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements may not protect against cognitive decline, according to a study published in Neurology. Past research hinted that taking vitamin B12 and folic acid might help protect cognitive skills, according to background information from the study. But follow-up trials have yielded less convincing findings. The current study included 2,919 people (average age, 74 years). Half took a tablet daily with 500 µg of vitamin B12 and 400 µg of folic acid, and the rest took a placebo every day for two years. All of the participants had high levels of homocysteine, which has been linked to memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease, according to the study.",taking vitamin B12 and folic acid might help protect cognitive skills,neutral,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/home-remedies-can-folic-acid-supplements-slow-cognitive-decline/," Could those with Alzheimer's disease also benefit from folic acid? ANSWER: There's no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in older adults or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. Blood levels of folate are classified as either low or normal in the general population. Low folate blood levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, which could be improved by folic acid supplements. However, folic acid is not helpful for people with normal blood levels. Reviews of randomized, controlled trials have shown mixed results about whether folic acid supplements have a benefit on cognitive function in healthy adults or in those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia.",There's no conclusive evidence,neutral,"

Eight years after the study ended, though, the men had a small decrease in their risk of cognitive impairment, though it was not a significant change.Certain people taking the supplements in the new long-term study did experience some small positive effects. One analysis of the data found that people with low blood levels of holotranscobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, improved their thinking speed with the vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements.“This agrees with the entire clinical picture of B12-related to memory trouble,” said Zwerling.The supplements given to both groups in the new study also included 15 micrograms of vitamin D3, which may improve brain function at high levels. It is possible that vitamin D3 diluted the effects of the other supplements on mental performance, although it could have simply eliminated any vitamin D3 deficiency among the participants.“Individuals, especially the elderly, differ in their metabolism of vitamin D and susceptibility to vitamin D deficiency,” said Zwerling. “Overall, the use of D3 just ‘evened the playing ground’ in a population known to have high rates of deficiency.”Although this new study failed to demonstrate the mental benefits of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements, vitamin B12 remains essential for overall health.Find Out: What Causes Dementia?",failed to demonstrate the mental benefits of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements,no,"

It seems that folic acid supplementation could improve cognitive function by decreasing Hcy, vascular care, attenuating inflammatory status, modification of cerebral folic acid deficiency, and antioxidant responses, especially in subjects with elevated serum Hcy levels. Moreover, the optimal dose of folic acid required to possible improvement in cognitive function is currently unknown. We recommend further studies involving large numbers of patients for longer durations of follow-up to clarify the exact dose of folic acid as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and different types of dementia and in the prevention of cognitive impairment in elderly. In addition, further robust clinical trials are needed to understand whether this treatment can reverse, slow, or prevent conversion from cognitive dysfunction to dementia. A dose of 4 mg/kg/day folic acid has ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in animal studies [8].",its role is still not completely clear,neutral,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2017/06/16/Folic-acid-and-dementia-Supplementation-benefits-elderly-people-with-mild-cognitive-decline-China-RCT," Dementia is a substantial public health concern in China due to the increasing number of older adults.Therefore, academics from Tianjin Medical School randomly assigned 168 people with mild cognitive impairment to folic acid supplementation or conventional-treatment groups.The researchers recorded significant improvements in cognitive function among the supplementation group, particularly in memory tasks.“Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines…in the treatment group during the follow-up period,”​ they wrote in the journal Scientific Reports.​The reduction in peripheral inflammatory cytokines is significant because they have emerged as a useful source for predicting individuals who are at a greater risk of developing dementia.Preclinical periodSeveral population-based studies have reported an association between peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels and the risk of cognitive impairment/dementia.“Dementia develops over a long preclinical period, and its association with inflammatory markers may be a consequence of the disease process rather than a causal association,” ​the researchers wrote.“Therefore, investigations of the role of inflammatory markers in the early stages of the disease process where cognitive decline is apparent but has not yet developed into the full clinical dementia syndrome are important. In this context, we selected individuals suffering from MCI and utilized a folic acid intervention to attenuate inflammation, as we believe this treatment would be a feasible public health strategy for preventing dementia.”​They concluded that folic acid has significant anti-inflammatory and memory-enhancing properties.“Supplementing the subjects’ diets with 400mg of folic acid daily for twelve months significantly improved their cognitive performance and reduced systemic inflammation. ​“Cognitive improvement resulting from folic acid supplementation depends on regulating the peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels. Folic acid is a promising treatment for individuals with mild cognitive impairment,” they added.​Source: Scientific Reports​doi:  10.1038/srep37486​“Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function by reducing the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines in elderly Chinese subjects with MCI”.​Authors: Fej Ma, et al​.

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61211," Diminshing cognitive functions such as deterioration in memory, reduced ability to process information quickly, and reduced verbal fluency have been linked to risk of dementia in old age. Dr Durga and colleagues followed a group of 818 over-50s for three years. Some were given 800 micrograms of a synthetic form of folic acid per day, the rest took a placebo. A synthetic version of the vitamin was used because the naturally occurring form degrades more easily, for example with storage and cooking, and that would make any results less reliable. The scientists found that the group who took the folic acid improved on all aspects of cognitive functioning compared to the group that took the placebo. Folic acid is a water soluble B vitamin and is found in yeast extract, green leafy vegetables, for example spinach, in dried beans and peas, some organ meats such as liver, fortified cereals, certain fruit and vegetables, and certain seeds, for example sunflower seeds.",improved on all aspects of cognitive functioning,neutral,"

The Link Between Folic Acid and Dementia
Research shows that regular folic acid intake could reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease by as much as 60 percent and, along with Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E, it appears to be one of the most effective vitamins for Alzheimer’s and dementia. It’s not just about Alzheimer’s prevention, either, with folic acid potentially holding the key to slowing down neurodegenerative decline in people with the condition. Exactly how folic acid reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease isn’t clear, although experts believe there are two ways in which the vitamin could be beneficial. Some professionals claim that folic acid regulates levels of homocysteine in the body, which is an amino acid which has long been thought to contribute towards dementia. Other Alzheimer’s clinical trials are also suggesting that the anti inflammatory properties of folic acid could help to reduce or prevent inflammation in the brain, minimizing the risk.",isn’t clear,neutral,"

E H Reynolds (reynolds@buckles.u-net.com), consultant neurologistInstitute of Epileptology, King's College, London SE5 9PJIt is becoming clear that folic acid affects mood and cognitive function, especially in older people. Edward Reynolds draws together the evidenceFolic acid is important for functioning of the nervous system at all ages.1–4 In the fetus the relation between maternal folate status and the risk of neural tube defects is well established: clinical trials have shown that periconceptual preventive treatment with 400 μg or higher of folic acid significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism are associated with a variety of overlapping syndromes which are influenced by age of clinical presentation. These include developmental delay, cognitive deterioration, motor and gait abnormalities, behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, seizures, signs of demyelination or failure of myelination, and vascular changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging or postmortem examination.4 Less commonly, subacute combined degeneration and peripheral neuropathy may also occur.In adult patients presenting with megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, approximately two thirds have neuropsychiatric disorders which overlap considerably with those associated with anaemia due to vitamin B-12 deficiency. 2 5 However, depression is commoner in patients with folate deficiency, and subacute combined degeneration with peripheral neuropathy is more frequent in those with vitamin B-12 deficiency.",PJIt is becoming clear that folic acid affects mood and cognitive function,neutral,"

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/duct-tape-for-warts," There is older and newer research that seems to demonstrate that duct tape works better for wart treatment than other methods, such as freezing.One 2003 study claims that duct tape is 80 percent effective for speeding up the rate at which warts go away.More clinical research is needed to discover if, and why, duct tape works to get rid of warts. What to know before you use this methodAvoid using duct tape on a wart that is:near your genitalsunder your armpitsclose to one of your mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Plantar warts, which occur on your heels or other parts of your feet, may be more resistant to these treatments because the layers of skin on your feet tend to be more difficult to remove. If you have genital warts, visit a doctor. Human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes topical and genital warts, can be transmitted sexually. Certain strains of HPV are associated with a greater risk of cervical cancer.Since genital warts are transmitted sexually, get tested to see which strain of HPV you have before you try any home treatments for your warts.

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325734," Therefore, it can take a while for warts to resolve on their own.Duct tape wart removal may help people get rid of warts more quickly, but this method requires frequent and repeated applications of duct tape, which can be difficult to keep up.For this reason, some people might prefer other home remedies or medical treatment options.In this article, we explain how to perform duct tape wart removal. We also discuss other ways to remove warts.Does it work?Share on PinterestPeople must use repeated applications of duct tape to remove a wart with this method.Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work for several reasons. One theory is that the tape deprives the skin cells of oxygen. By “suffocating” the wart, the duct tape makes it more likely that the skin cells will die.The process of applying and removing the duct tape may also remove additional skin cells, which can make the wart less bulky and noticeable.However, there is a lack of recent research into using duct tape as a wart removal treatment, and earlier studies have produced mixed results.One 2002 study found that the duct tape method was significantly more effective than cryotherapy, which involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The study included 51 participants ages 3–22.They received either up to six sessions of cryotherapy, which took place every 2–3 weeks, or 2 months of duct tape application. Warts resolved entirely in 85% of the participants in the duct tape group and in 60% of those in the cryotherapy group.However, a 2007 study into using adhesive pads to treat warts found that adding duct tape to a breathable fabric called moleskin made no difference to its effectiveness.",Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work,neutral,"

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://warts.org/wart-removal/natural/duct-tape-method," It is also believed that using duct tape for wart removal forces the immune system to destroy the virus causing the wart.The duct tape inflames the wart until the immune system responds to the area where the wart is located. This then allows the immune system to destroy the HPV and the wart. This apparently is a faster process compared to just allowing the wart to come off naturally untreated. However, this theory hasn’t been proven by scientific research. Another unproven theory states that the strong adhesive of the duct tape helps remove the dead skin where the virus hides.Duct tape is composed of three major layers.

So, week after week after repeating the duct tape process you will be “peeling” the wart off your skin.Weather duct tape is effective or not, one thing that is definitely true is that using duct tape on warts helps to prevent the virus from spreading further (warts are caused by human papillomavirus) since duct tape stops the wart from contacting other parts of your skin.When definitely not to try duct tape for warts removalAvoid using duct tape on warts if warts are located in one of the following areas:Close to you mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Under your armpitsNear your genitalsPs!

How Can Duct Tape Help to Get Rid of Warts? There is a special medical tape for the removal of warts, which is a patch impregnated with a special substance – salicylic acid. Its active components contribute to the gradual destruction of pathological cells. In other words, they simply corrode the wart. As a result, the wart begins to decrease in size and after a while it disappears altogether. But you should understand that the adhesive tape from the papillomas can only eliminate the cosmetic defect of the skin as a result of infection of the body with HPV.",There is a special medical tape for the removal of warts,no,"

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://wellnessfacts.net/duct-tape-for-warts/," [01]Use of duct tape to remove warts is called as ‘Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy’ and this therapy has limited clinical results that favour its use to treat warts. [02] [03] But being an easy treatment solution that can be practised with a simple household product, this home remedy became widely popular in those who are seeking the faster recovery from warts.As we discussed,  warts are caused by human papillomavirus and duct tape treatment does not help to remove the actual virus instead it works as a local remedy that removes the wart. Even some clinical trials yield the good results and also found that duct tape occlusion therapy (also known as DTOT) is a significantly more effective way to treat common warts than cryotherapy. [04][thrive_text_block color=”light”] Bottom Line: Duct tape occlusion therapy does show modest results in removing warts on extremities but as an easy way of treatment one should try it once before practising other lines of treatment (surgery, cryotherapy, freezing of warts etc) to kill warts.

Should I apply ice to a burn?,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/should-you-put-ice-on-a-burn-or-not/," And what should you do instead? Ice or very cold water on a burn decreases blood flow to the burnt area, which can reverse the healing process. According to Dr. Capin, the application of ice numbs the burn, which can lead to frostnip, a dangerous precursor to frostbite. An ice burn is a bigger risk than you might think. “Because the skin is already damaged from the heat burn, you may not feel that the ice is making your skin too cold,” he adds. “That can lead to permanent blood flow problems.”

Should I apply ice to a burn?,https://www.uwhealth.org/news/the-right-way-to-treat-burns," But that’s the last thing you should do, says Angela Gibson, MD, PhD, who specializes in the surgical treatment of burns and trauma at UW Health’s Burn Center.“It makes you feel better, but the ice could lead to a deepening of the burn because it causes constriction of the blood vessels,” Gibson explains. Nearly a half million people seek treatment for burns every year, and many more deal with mild burns at home. Burn injuries are classified with degrees: first-degree burns affect just the top layer of skin (epidermis), second-degree burns reach the dermis layer in the middle, and third-degree burns affect the full thickness of skin, down to the layer of fat underneath the dermis. Tips for treating burn injuriesWithout proper treatment, even superficial burns can deepen, making healing more difficult.

Burns shouldn't be treated with ice because it can make the body too cold. The affected area that comes in direct contact with the ice can become so cold that additional damage is done. Room-temperature or cool water is best as ice water can pose the same potential problems as ice. Show More

Article SummaryXTo treat an ice burn, first soak your burned skin in warm water for 20 minutes to warm it back up. Then, dry the area off and see how it feels. If it’s still numb, itchy, or tingly, repeat the soaking process as needed until your skin feels better, taking 20 minutes off in between each soak. Alternatively, you can apply a warm compress to the area for 20 minutes at a time. If blisters or an open wound form, clean the area and cover it with nonstick gauze. Replace the gauze daily.","SummaryXTo treat an ice burn, first soak your burned skin in warm water",no,"

The likelihood of scarring depends on many factors, including the area of the ice burn and how many layers of tissue are affected.The skin consists of several layers. These include an outer layer, known as the epidermis, and a lower layer, called the dermis. Beneath these layers are tissues that include muscles, tendons, and other connective tissue.If a burn only penetrates the epidermis, it may not cause significant scarring. However, injuries that affect the dermis or the tissues beneath it are more complex wounds that can leave scars.Ice burn vs. frostbiteThere is little difference between ice burn and frostbite. The term ice burn refers to burns that result from contact with ice or ice packs.Frostbite occurs when the exposure of parts of the body to extremely cold temperatures freezes the skin and the tissue beneath it.Frostbite that penetrates the deeper layers of the skin and damages tissue and bone can cause permanent damage.First aid and treatmentUpon getting an ice burn, a person should immediately be taking the following actions:getting out of the cold or removing the item causing the injuryremoving wet clothingavoiding touching or rubbing the area to prevent further damageremoving debris from any injured skinwarming the skin by soaking it in 99–102°F (37–39°C) waterapplying blankets or warm compressesrepeating the soaking process every 20 minutes if necessaryOnce the area is warm again, a person should try:Share on PinterestGauze can protect the skin from dirt and germs.using gauze to protect the skin from dirt and germsincreasing fluid intake for hydrationtaking an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever if necessaryapplying a soothing ointment, such as aloe vera, to unbroken skinseeking medical advice regarding the necessity of a tetanus shotIt is vital to warm up the skin gradually rather than using very hot water or air, as extreme heat could make the injury worse.When to see a doctorPeople can usually treat superficial ice burns at home using first aid.",a person should immediately be taking the following actions,neutral,"

      The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter.",folic acid,neutral,"

According to some scientific studies, a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation and sun exposure is a good strategy to regain natural skin color.

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/," More recently, an extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, (which compared 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg vitamin B-12 daily with placebo) in 1,298 participants found that after a median of 54 months, the intervention had no effect on CVD risk [77]. Overall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other B-vitamins does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death. Dementia and cognitive function
Observational studies have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [78-81]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions [80]. Most observational studies have found correlations between low serum vitamin B12 concentrations alone or in combination with high folate concentrations and poor cognitive function [82-87]. For example, an analysis of cross-sectional 2011–2014 NHANES data on 2,420 adults aged 60 years or older found that low vitamin B12 (MMA greater than 0.27 micromol/L or serum vitamin B12 less than 203 pg/mL [150 pmol/L]) combined with high folic acid—unmetabolized serum folic acid greater than 0.44 mcg/L (1 nmol/L) or serum total folate higher than 32.7 mcg/L (74.1 nmol/L)—was associated an almost two to three times higher risk of cognitive impairment [82].",does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death,no,"

But this doesn’t mean that their low vitamin D caused, or is even affecting, their vitiligo, and supplementing their vitamin D may be a good idea for their overall health, but is unlikely to help their vitiligo. Some have heard that vitiligo is partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in melanocytes, you can read more about that here.

However it is important to remember that no matter how much things seem to make sense, we can’t know for sure if this approach will help vitiligo until they’re tested in clinical trials.

People who lack vitamin B12 can also develop pernicious anemia, a condition where the body cannot absorb B12 from foods and is unable to make a sufficient quantity of healthy red blood cells. This condition is associated with vitiligo, a pigmentation disorder which causes white patches to develop on your skin.12
Studies show that a combination of sun exposure and oral supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 can be helpful in treating vitiligo.13
B12 deficiency may also give a yellow tinge to your skin and even the white portion of your eye as in its absence, red blood cells become fragile and break down into bile. The lack of functional red blood cells and rise in bile levels manifest on the skin as paleness and yellowness. Since the lack of folate or vitamin B9 also leads to the production of abnormal red blood cells, paleness can be caused by a folate deficiency as well. RDA: 2.4 mcg for adults14

Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/asthma-yoga," Certain yoga poses can manage symptoms by reducing stress levels, opening the chest, and encouraging deep breathing. Read more to learn about how yoga can help people with asthma and some simple poses to try.How yoga can help asthmaShare on PinterestOana Szekely/Getty ImagesAsthma is a chronic lung disease that affects the airways. During an asthma attack, the airways become narrowed and inflamed. The muscles surrounding them tighten and squeeze, resulting in symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.Treatment for asthma usually involves taking medication, which relaxes the muscles around the airways and reduces swelling and mucus.Some research shows that yoga may be useful as a complementary treatment for asthma. This means that a person would perform it in addition to an existing treatment plan, likely involving medication.A 2016 review of clinical trials involving 1,048 participants found that yoga somewhat improves quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. However, researchers noted that many of the studies were flawed.",Some research shows that yoga may be useful as a complementary treatment for asthma,neutral,"

There also appears to be a bias in the publication of studies that showed a benefit of yoga for the treatment of asthma. This means that it is highly likely that studies that showed no benefit of yoga for the treatment of asthma were never published, whereas studies that did show a benefit were published.

There seem to be benefits to using yoga-related breathing exercises for the treatment of asthma.

Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,https://asthma.newlifeoutlook.com/yoga-for-asthma/," Below are just a few things that yoga can do for asthma.Overall Health and Body AwarenessYoga postures can help increase your stamina, regardless of your level of health, and enhance your ability to breathe deeply. These exercises relieve stress and improve the function of all of your body systems including your immune system, so you will be able to fight off respiratory infections more readily.Yoga also increases body awareness. You will become more tuned into your body’s subtle signs. By recognizing slight changes quickly, you will be able to recognize signs of flare-ups of symptoms quickly and then take action.Better Breathing and Breathing TechniquesUnlike most other forms of exercise, yoga teaches breathing techniques, which can strengthen your lungs and the muscles that support respiration.Breathing techniques can also help relieve stress, which is important because stress causes increased resistance within your airways. If you are having difficulty breathing due to your asthma, you naturally experience stress, and as stress increases your breathing becomes more difficult. Yoga breathing exercises can be used to prevent and break this often terrifying cycle.Calm Your MindMeditation is an integral component of yoga practice.",Yoga also increases body awareness,neutral,"

Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/asthma-pictures/great-yoga-poses-for-asthma-relief.aspx," A review of 15 studies published in April 2016 in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews looked at the effect of yoga in patients with asthma, finding that yoga “probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.”“There can be outside forces, such as allergens and toxins, that may trigger an asthma attack,” says Bar. “While we can’t always necessarily avoid some triggers, we can use yoga to try to generally stay calm and have breath and body awareness, and that may be able to at least take a layer off the severity of the attack, if not help prevent it.”Doing yoga routinely can have a cumulative effect, says Bar. If you begin to feel an asthma attack coming on, you can use breath awareness, says Bar, to slow down and remain calm. During an asthma attack, Bar adds, we use any muscles we can to try to breathe, and as a result, our muscles get very tight; stretching the shoulders, back, side, and breathing muscles routinely is great conditioning for getting those muscles in the habit of relaxing in the event of an asthma attack. “You can do a relaxation pose every day and do one or two of the body stretches daily,” says Bar. “It won’t take very long.” And best of all, there are secondary benefits of yoga, such as a feeling of peace, increased mobility, better flexibility, and improved balance, says Bar.Simply put, yoga may help provide some asthma relief, and can lead to a host of other health benefits.",probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma,neutral,"

Starving a Fever May Really Be an Effective Cure: Eating Well Helps Infection Spread Faster in Water Fleas

Starving a fever really may be an effective cure, according to a new study that revealed plentiful food appeared to accelerate the spread of infections. The new study looked at bacterial infections in water fleas and found that increasing their supply of food can speed up the spread of infection. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh found that when parasite-infected water fleas were well fed, some fleas became highly contagious compared to when food was scarce. Researchers said that the findings, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggest that under certain conditions, some individuals are more likely to spread disease compared to others. Researchers said that the finding could help researchers monitor and control the spread of infections like epidemics in large populations. ""If we have an idea of which individuals transmit a lot of disease, we will be better able to stop its spread,"" researcher Dr. Pedro Vale of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh said in a statement.",Christine Hsu,neutral,"

Eating food when you have a cold can also help the body generate heat, although other methods of keeping warm, like wearing an extra layer of clothes or wrapping yourself in a blanket, do the trick as well. There are many reasons you shouldn’t try to starve a fever. Fever is part of the immune system’s attempt to combat the virus.

Thankfully, starving is no longer recommended for treating any sickness. Proper nutrition – and even more important, proper hydration – is crucial in preventing and recovering from both fevers and colds.

Is the old adage “feed a cold, starve a fever” true? NorthShore's Robert Mitchell Figura, D.O., puts to rest the truth of this ancient wisdom. The reason people say “feed a cold” is because the body needs energy when it's fighting illness. This applies to both colds and flu, but for different reasons. For a cold, eating healthy food will provide the body the extra energy it needs to fight illness, but can also help the body generate heat. The cold virus replicates faster in a cold environment so raising your body's temperature along with bundling up can stop cold germs in their tracks, said Dr. Figura.",true,neutral,"

This, however, is a remedy of the past that should stay there. Starving is not recommended for treating any sickness. In fact, it can actually deprive your body of what it needs to fight off infection, delaying your recovery.﻿﻿


   Why It Doesn't Work  

When your body is combating a cold, it needs energy in the form of calories to fight off infection and recover. The same applies when you have a fever—and it may be even more important in that case.

Maxims typically date back many years, but “feed a cold, starve a fever” may beat them all. This saying has been traced to a 1574 dictionary by John Withals, which noted that “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief is that eating food may help the body generate warmth during a “cold” and that avoiding food may help it cool down when overheated. But recent medical science says the old saw is wrong. It should be “feed a cold, feed a fever.”

Feed a cold and starve a fever. Should you feed a cold and starve a fever? Or is it the other way around, starve a cold and feed a fever? Whatever you may have heard about starving or feeding a cold or the flu, the good news is that this maxim is a myth: starving is never an appropriate option for dealing with a cold or flu. That’s because calorie restriction (starving) puts the immune system in a state of distress, while calorie ingestion (feeding) favors immunity. The best thing you can do when you’re suffering from a cold or flu is take in plenty of fluids and eat foods rich in zinc and antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamins C and E.
Foods rich in zinc include: eggs, meats, nuts, seafood, seeds, wheat germ, and whole grains; while most brightly colored fruits, vegetables and dark leafy greens are high in antioxidants.",starving is never an appropriate option,no,"

Is starving a fever effective?,https://mygirlyspace.com/feeding-a-fever-and-starving-a-cold/," Fasting and dehydration may increase our immunity against bacterial infections but it undermines our body’s antiviral immune response.Feeding a fever sparks our immune responses by promoting interferon production, helping fight off viral infections, the most common cause of fever. In contrast, starving a fever only assists anti-bacterial immune response, a significantly less common source of infection.Current Thinking On Feeding and Starving A ColdThere is little hard evidence on the effectiveness either way in support of the case for feeding or starving a cold. One Cochrane review flags potential issues with the build up of excess fluids, while another randomised study found no effect from feeding a milk-rich diet to people with colds on either the severity of the illness or the amelioration of other symptoms such as mucous secretion and cough. Generally, the results of studies into common cold treatments are inconsistent and ultimately inconclusive.Is Medicating Fevers Effective?Following the logic that a fever is the body’s way of fighting off infection, therefore it comes as no surprise to discover that there is no proven link between attempts to cool the body and improved survival rates. In fact it may even result in greater mortality risks in certain circumstances.

Does selenium help prevent cancer?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491296/," More recently, several randomised controlled trials designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can prevent cancer have been carried out. These trials played a major role in enhancing our understanding of the relation between selenium and cancer risk as a result of their stronger study design as compared with observational studies. The most recent trials in particular have shown high methodological quality and statistical power. Several trials focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate cancer.Study characteristics
This review includes 10 trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo, and 70 observational studies in which adults were followed over time to determine whether their baseline selenium status was associated with their risk of cancer. The evidence is current to January 2017.Key results
All of the high‐quality randomised trials reported no effect of selenium on reducing overall risk of cancer or risk of particular cancers, including the most investigated outcome ‐ prostate cancer. Some trials unexpectedly suggested that selenium may increase risks of high‐grade prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dermatological abnormalities.Observational studies have yielded inconsistent evidence of a possible effect of selenium exposure on cancer risk, with no evidence of a dose‐response relation.",selenium supplementation can prevent cancer,yes,"

The researchers found that supplementation with selenium in the randomized controlled trials did not lead to a reduced risk of cancer. In contrast, the observational studies showed that lower cancer risk and lower cancer mortality were directly linked to high concentrations of selenium. In particular, the data showed a reduced risk of certain cancers, such as breast, lung, colon, bladder and prostate cancer. Selenium helps stimulate the DNA repair process
Another recent study showed that selenium can help repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage by carcinogens.

However, it is not possible to conclude from these studies that selenium was the reason for the lower cancer risk, because a high selenium level might be associated with other factors that reduce cancer risk, such as a healthier diet or lifestyle. Also, selenium comes in many different chemical forms that have different biological activity, and these studies did not identify which chemical forms were being measured. Selenium levels in body tissues in which people might develop cancer (e.g. the prostate) also were not examined.The randomised controlled trials that assessed whether taking selenium supplements might prevent cancer differed considerably in methodological quality and are not equally reliable.","selenium could prevent prostate, skin or other specific types of cancer",neutral,"

Does selenium help prevent cancer?,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/08/21/selenium-and-cancer-friends-or-foes," Many Canadians get the nutrients they need from a healthy and balanced diet, and selenium is no exception (3;6). Even so, two-thirds of women and one-half of men over the age of 70 – add nutritional supplements like vitamins, minerals, fibre, antacids, and fish oils to their diet, hoping that this will give their health an added boost (6).When it comes to cancer, can selenium supplements help? Past research on the topic has had conflicting results, while recent research suggests that they may do more harm than good (2).What the research tells usIn the past, studies showed that taking selenium as a supplement helped prevent people from getting cancer. However, a more recent systematic review suggests that this might not be true. This review looked at many different types of cancer – including head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, skin, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and blood cancer – and found no evidence that selenium supplements reduced cancer risk (2;7).

This leads to oxidative stress, which damages healthy cells (1).Oxidative stress has been linked to chronic conditions like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and cancer, as well as premature aging and the risk of stroke (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).Antioxidants like selenium help reduce oxidative stress by keeping free radical numbers in check (7).They work by neutralizing excess free radicals and protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress.Summary Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that fights oxidative stress and helps defend your body from chronic conditions, such as heart disease and cancer.2. May reduce your risk of certain cancersIn addition to decreasing oxidative stress, selenium may help lower the risk of certain cancers.This has been attributed to selenium’s ability to reduce DNA damage and oxidative stress, boost your immune system, and destroy cancer cells (8).A review of 69 studies that included over 350,000 people found that having a high blood level of selenium was associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer, including breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancers (9).It’s important to note that this effect was only associated with selenium obtained through foods, not supplements.However, some research suggests that supplementing with selenium may reduce side effects in people undergoing radiation therapy.For example, one study found that oral selenium supplements improved overall quality of life and reduced radiation-induced diarrhea in women with cervical and uterine cancer (10).Summary Higher blood levels of selenium may protect against certain cancers, while supplementing with selenium may help improve quality of life in people undergoing radiation therapy.3. May protect against heart diseaseA diet rich in selenium may help keep your heart healthy, as low selenium levels have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease.In an analysis of 25 observational studies, a 50% increase in blood selenium levels was associated with a 24% reduction in the risk of heart disease (11).Selenium may also lower markers of inflammation in your body⁠ — one of the main risk factors for heart disease.For example, a review of 16 controlled studies including over 433,000 people with heart disease showed that taking selenium supplements decreased levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).Additionally, it increased levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful antioxidant (12).This indicates that selenium may help lower heart disease risk by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in your body. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been linked to atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in arteries.Atherosclerosis can lead to dangerous health problems like strokes, heart attacks, and heart disease (13).Incorporating selenium-rich foods into your diet is a great way to keep levels of oxidative stress and inflammation to a minimum.Summary Selenium may help keep your heart healthy by keeping oxidative stress in check and reducing your risk of heart disease.4.

(iStock)There is no convincing evidence that taking high doses of selenium -- a popular dietary supplement -- can prevent cancer, according to a new review.Selenium is a mineral that is essential for humans, and is also present in soil and rocks.While daily selenium recommendations from the United States and World Health Organization vary between 30 and 55 micrograms per day for adults, the authors note, companies that sell the supplements claim that higher doses have a range of health benefits, including cancer prevention.However, ""we still do not have an exact picture of what selenium is doing to human health,"" Dr. Marco Vinceti, one of the authors of the new review from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy, told Reuters Health.To try to get a better focus on that picture for cancer in particular, Vinceti and his colleagues analyzed 55 studies on the link between selenium and different types of cancer.Most of those were so-called ""observational studies"" -- scientists measured how much selenium people ate every day or how much they had in their blood or toenails, then tracked who got cancer over the next few years.The remaining 6 studies were done through more rigorous trials, in which researchers randomly divided participants into one group that took selenium supplements for a month or more, and another that took a drug-free placebo pill or nothing -- then followed them for cancer. These kinds of studies are thought to be better at accounting for outside factors that may affect cancer risk.The observational studies suggested that talking selenium may be linked to a slightly lower risk of cancer -- more so in men than women.But in the randomized trials, people assigned to take selenium at doses at least four times higher than the daily recommendation were not less likely to get cancer -- prostate cancer and skin cancer, in particular -- than those not taking selenium.And some of those trials raised the question of whether high doses of selenium might be dangerous, such as by increasing the risk of diabetes.The review is published in the Cochrane Library, a publication of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. ""If you put it all together, it's not a good story for patients,"" Dr. Neil Fleshner, a researcher at University Health Network in Toronto who has studied the effect of selenium on prostate cancer risk, told Reuters Health.He said it's still possible that selenium may help prevent cancer over a very long time period, or that certain kinds of selenium might work while others don't. But right now, ""there's no good evidence at all that selenium is beneficial,"" said Fleshner, who was not involved in the review.James Marshall, of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, said that the excitement about selenium began with evidence that animals or people with very low selenium in their diet are at an increased risk for cancer.While those individuals might benefit from a selenium supplement, that's where the mineral's anti-cancer effects appear to end.",selenium may help prevent cancer over a very long time period,neutral,"

Does selenium help prevent cancer?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet," Examples of dietary antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E (alpha-tocopherol). The mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant, but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component (i.e., selenium-containing proteins), and not to selenium itself (4). Can antioxidant supplements help prevent cancer? In laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Therefore, researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans. Many observational studies, including case–control studies and cohort studies, have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans.",the antioxidant effects,neutral,"

There were no cases of selenium toxicity. These results were greeted with great interest but also with caution; some doctors felt they were too good to be true, and most stressed the need for further research. The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial has issued two subsequent reports, which extend the observation period by 25 months, to the end of the trial.

“Uptake, Distribution, and Speciation of Selenoamino Acids by Human Cancer Cells: X-ray Absorption and Fluorescence Methods” Biochemistry




A controversy over whether selenium can fight cancer in humans might come down to which form of the essential micronutrient people take, scientists are reporting. It turns out that not all “seleniums” are the same — the researchers found that one type of selenium supplement may produce a possible cancer-preventing substance more efficiently than another form of selenium in human cancer cells. Their study appears in the ACS’ journal Biochemistry. Hugh Harris and colleagues note that although the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer clinical trial showed that selenium reduced the risk of cancer, a later study called the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial did not show a benefit.

Selenoproteins help prevent the oxidative modification of lipids, reducing inflammation and preventing platelets from aggregating [9]. For these reasons, experts have suggested that selenium supplements could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. The epidemiological data on the role of selenium in cardiovascular disease have yielded conflicting conclusions. Some observational studies have found an inverse association between serum selenium concentrations and risk of hypertension or coronary heart disease.

While there are a handful of methods of treating ovarian cysts, including laparoscopy (a type of surgery), if a woman's body frequently forms functional cysts, it is common for doctors to prescribe the birth control pill. The reason? To prevent the patient from ovulating. No ovulation means a much lower possibility of developing functional cysts, since they are directly related to ovulation.

Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,https://allcysts.com/hormonal-birth-control-for-ovarian-cyst-treatment/," Hormonal birth control for ovarian cyst treatment 

Hormonal contraception affects primarily the appearance and development of cysts formed as a result of hormonal disorders. So hormonal birth control for ovarian cyst treatment can be used only in case of functional cysts. As you know, ovarian follicular cyst occurs when the ovarian follicle, which is formed during each menstrual cycle, is not destroyed and the egg can’t be released from it. In the case of the so-called corpus luteum cyst, there is another situation. After the rupture of the follicle and the exit of the egg from it, a yellow body is formed. If during the menstrual cycle the woman has not got pregnant, the corpus luteum usually disappears.",can be used only in case of functional cysts,neutral,"

Though 
                        birth control pills do help in preventing cysts yet it 
                        is not the ultimate solution. There have been cases 
                        where in spite of taking birth control pills cysts have 
                        occurred. And birth control pills can't actually cure

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19472602/," Studies found no adverse effects of maternal zinc supplementation on iron status during pregnancy. More information is required on other potential adverse effects, particularly with regard to a possible modifying effect of preexisting maternal zinc status. In view of the possible benefits of zinc supplementation for reducing the risk of premature delivery, the possible positive impact of zinc supplementation on infant birthweight among undernourished women, and the lack of reported adverse effects, zinc should be included in maternal supplements given during pregnancy in populations at risk for zinc deficiency.

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc-supplements," Insulin is the hormone responsible for transporting sugar from your bloodstream to your tissues (11).Some research suggests that zinc may help keep blood sugar levels steady and improve your body’s sensitivity to insulin.One review reported that low zinc levels could be linked to impaired blood sugar levels and type 2 diabetes (12).Other research shows that zinc may help reduce insulin resistance, which can improve your body’s ability to use insulin efficiently to maintain normal blood sugar levels (13, 14).Helps fight acneZinc supplements are often used to promote skin health and treat common skin conditions like acne (15).A type of zinc called zinc sulfate has been proven especially useful for decreasing symptoms of mild to moderate acne (16).According to one review, not only did people with acne tend to have lower blood levels of zinc compared with those without acne, but zinc supplements were also able to decrease the average amount of inflammatory bumps caused by the condition (17).Zinc supplements are also often favored over other treatment methods, as they’re inexpensive, effective, and associated with far fewer side effects (15).May improve heart healthHeart disease is a serious health condition, accounting for roughly 33% of deaths worldwide (18).Some research shows that taking zinc may improve several risk factors for heart disease. They may even lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels.A review of 24 studies found that zinc supplements decreased levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood triglycerides. As such, they could potentially help prevent heart disease (19).Another analysis of nine studies showed that zinc supplements could reduce systolic blood pressure levels, which is the top number of blood pressure readings (20).However, research on the effects of supplements on blood pressure is limited. Further, some studies suggest that low levels of serum zinc may be associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, though findings remain inconclusive. Thus, more research is needed (21).Slows macular degenerationMacular degeneration is a common eye disease and one of the leading causes of vision loss around the globe (22).Zinc supplements are often used to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and help protect against vision loss and blindness.One 2014 study in 72 people with AMD showed that taking 50 mg of zinc sulfate daily for 3 months slowed the progression of the disease (23).Other reviews similarly recommend zinc supplements to slow the progression of AMD, claiming that it may improve nutrient flow in the retina to protect against disease (24, 25).However, other studies suggest that zinc supplements alone may not significantly improve vision and should be paired with other treatment options to maximize results (26).As such, more research is needed to learn more about the connection between this mineral and eye health.SummaryZinc may reduce the duration of cold symptoms, support blood sugar management, improve severe and inflammatory acne, decrease heart disease risk, and slow the progression of macular degeneration.5 Foods that Are High in ZincTypes of zinc supplementsWhen choosing a zinc supplement, you’ll likely notice that there are many different types available.These various forms of zinc affect your health in distinct ways.Here are a few types you might find on the market:Zinc gluconate.

Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture?,https://www.thepodiatrygroup.com/2021/05/28/the-benefits-of-using-an-ankle-brace/," Benefits Of An Ankle Brace
In general, an ankle brace keeps your foot and toes pointed forward and prevents inward rotation or twisting of the foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains (stretching and tearing of ligaments, tendons, and other soft tissue) occur with sudden twisting or rotation of the ankle joint as you step off a curb or stair, or run on a bumpy, uneven surface. When an ankle injury occurs, coaches, primary care physicians, orthopaedic specialists, and podiatrists often advise patients to wear ankle braces for joint support and to prevent further injury. Bracing also limits the development of scar tissue and arthritis and reduces both acute and chronic pain. An ankle brace is an adjunctive tool after casting, surgery, physical therapy, exercise, targeted training, and other kinds of medical interventions. Your podiatrist in South Texas may advise an ankle brace in these situations:

Ankle fracture
Hindfoot fracture
Ankle sprain and repeated ankle sprains
Ankle instability due to arthritis, sprains, and obesity
Poor balance
Dysfunctional gait, such as toeing in or repeated inward rotation of the ankle joint
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis
Gout

When two or three parts of the malleoli of the ankle are broken, the ankle is unstable, and surgery is necessary. Nonsurgical treatment may be an option when the break is minor, the bones are in alignment, and the ankle is stable. However, if the bone has moved out of place and can be put back in to position – a procedure called closed reduction nonsurgical treatment may be sufficient. The goal is to protect the fractured bone while it heals.

#282  Ankle brace vs air cast after ankle fracture

I have been in an Aircast ever since and I’m been getting an x-ray every two weeks to make sure it’s healing in place. I’ve been in the Aircast and I’ve been walking since day five and I’ve had next to no swelling and I have no pain now at all.",whether or not a runner can use an ankle brace,neutral,"

This is crucial to have a successful ankle fracture recovery.What Happens If a Broken Ankle Goes Untreated?If your ankle has been fractured and you do not get medical attention, it can lead to long-term consequences. The main concerns are that it could cause a nonunion or a delayed union.A nonunion occurs when the broken bone fails to heal.By comparison, a delayed union fracture does eventually heal, but it takes much longer than is typical.Failure to get timely treatment could cause foot deformities that can interfere with walking, running or even completing daily tasks. You’re also at a higher risk of developing an infection or arthritis if you delay with your ankle fracture recovery.What Kind of Surgeries Are Used for a Broken Ankle?First, it’s important to realize that you may not need surgery to treat your broken ankle at all. In fact, at the Raleigh Bone and Joint Surgery Clinic, we always implement conservative approaches to treatment. That means we will only consider surgery if it is absolutely necessary.If surgery is needed, one of the most common procedures to help a fractured ankle is an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).During  an ORIF, the pieces of your bone are repositioned so that they are properly aligned and then physically reconnected, usually involving screws, rods, plates or even surgical nails.",the only way to tell for certain is to have an X-ray,neutral,"

Ankle ligaments, muscle and tendon units, and the bones of your ankle, create the internal supports to keep your ankle safe. These internal supports are important links from your foot to your hip, allowing for ideal performance. Ankle braces serve as the external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion (movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward),  and provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space. Jacobson says for maximum effectiveness, ankle braces should fit comfortably in the shoes you wear during an activity, which also helps with brace use compliance. “After experiencing an ankle injury, it’s important to consider rehabilitation as part of your treatment plan,” adds Jacobson. “Often, when an athlete is still having ankle pain or isn’t back to full function, it’s because he or she hasn’t allowed for enough time to properly heal.”

Your Brace May Be Helping, But Your Body Can Do Better  It’s not what you do in your brace, it’s what you do without it.When recovering from an ankle sprain it is great to wear an ankle brace when first returning to your sport to help you feel more confident in practice and to help you learn to trust your ankle again. When you are not in practice, it is essential to participate in a rehab program that helps your muscles and ligaments heal, strengthens the muscles that were injured, and helps to correct the faulty mechanics that allowed the injury to happen in the first place. A good rehab program should include tasks that help you:Increase blood flow to bring healing cells to your ankle structuresAppropriately and progressively load the ankle muscles to allow for muscle adaptation that increases your ankle strength and stability.Correct body mechanics through a strength and control program to strengthen the muscles that were weak prior to injury and prevent it from happening again

Given its name, ankle braces are a medical garment worn around the ankle to give this part of the person’s foot protection by immobilizing the joint and providing heat and compression to the bones, while allowing it to heal. They are commonly used in injury rehabilitation processes. To ensure fit and fixation, the foot may need adhering, and in severe cases, they need a metallic plate to better immobilize the joint. The most current evidence reveals that the use of ankle braces, as recommended by certified athletic trainers or licensed physicians, has decreased the number of initial ankle injuries and re-injuries, as well as reducing the severity of ankle injuries and future risk.

An athlete who has recovered from an ankle injury may find it helpful to use high-top shoes, an ankle brace or ankle taping to reduce the risk of further joint damage. Treatment
If your ankle fracture involves only one malleolus, and the segments of broken bone lie very close together, your doctor usually can treat the injury by immobilizing your ankle and foot in a cast for six to eight weeks. After the cast is removed, your doctor will prescribe physical therapy to help restore the normal range of motion in your ankle joint.

But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. ""People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not,"" Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it ""a proven scientific fact"" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also ""nonsense"", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. ""People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars,"" Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen.",vitamin E will not help scars,no,"

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://drcarolyndean.com/does-magnesium-help-migraines/," And, more importantly, does magnesium help migraines? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no, but research suggests a link between magnesium and migraines, or, more specifically, magnesium deficiency, which can also cause muscle contractions, nausea, numbness, a loss of appetite and fatigue. Magnesium and Menstrual Migraines
Menstrual migraines typically occur around the beginning of your cycle. Many patients find the throbbing, intense pain, nausea, and other troublesome conditions associated with menstrual migraines challenging to correct, which is why it’s ideal to prevent the migraines before they begin. Plenty of research links the onset of these migraines to magnesium deficiency, which is why it’s helpful to start taking magnesium by the 15th day of your menstrual cycle. One study indicates that 360 mg of magnesium a day starting on the 15th day reduced the number of days with a headache.",research suggests a link between magnesium and migraines,neutral,"

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22426836/," Lack of magnesium may promote cortical spreading depression, hyperaggregation of platelets, affect serotonin receptor function, and influence synthesis and release of a variety of neurotransmitters. Migraine sufferers may develop magnesium deficiency due to genetic inability to absorb magnesium, inherited renal magnesium wasting, excretion of excessive amounts of magnesium due to stress, low nutritional intake, and several other reasons. There is strong evidence that magnesium deficiency is much more prevalent in migraine sufferers than in healthy controls. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have produced mixed results, most likely because both magnesium deficient and non-deficient patients were included in these trials. This is akin to giving cyanocobalamine in a blinded fashion to a group of people with peripheral neuropathy without regard to their cyanocobalamine levels.

And finally what are the potential risks and side effects of magnesium?I- What Is Magnesium?Magnesium is a mineral involved in many functions of the body in children and adults.Magnesium helps reduce fatigue and assists in the normal functioning of the nervous system.It is also involved in normal psychological functions such as concentration, reasoning, and memory.In general, we find up to 24 g of magnesium in the body, of which approximately 65% is stored in the bones, which represent a reservoir that can be mobilized in part when needed.A certain amount of magnesium is also found in the muscles and certain organs such as the liver, the heart, and the kidneys.II- Can Magnesium Help with Headaches and MigrainesMagnesium is very important to preserve the nervous and muscular balance and to relieve many ailments.Thus, it helps to reduce fatigue and stress, which are two of the factors that can trigger a migraine.During migraine attacks, the level of magnesium in the blood and cells often drops.During a particularly severe and long-lasting attack, a single infusion of magnesium can stop the migraine permanently.In addition, sufficient magnesium intake effectively reduces the frequency and intensity of migraines.# How to Use Magnesium for Migraines and HeadachesMagnesium plays a very important role in the calcium channels that regulate the vasoconstriction of the vessels.If you have migraines, take regular courses of magnesium chloride as a preventive measure.In case of migraine or headaches, taking 1 glass of magnesium chloride solution can relieve you.In addition, the Dead Sea salt bath, which contains 46% magnesium chloride, is also well known for relieving headaches.Taking magnesium as a preventive measure during attacks, at a rate of 300 to 600 mg per day, could reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.# How Does Magnesium Prevent Migraine?Migraines are painful and frequent, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Magnesium consumption can solve this problem.Some studies suggest that magnesium can prevent and help treat migraines.In addition, a one-gram supplement of magnesium can relieve an acute migraine attack faster and more effectively than a common medication.Magnesium-rich foods can also help reduce migraine symptoms.Magnesium plays an essential role in brain function and mood, and low levels are linked to an increased risk of depression.# Primary and Secondary HypomagnesemiaHypomagnesemia is a serum magnesium concentration below 1.8 mg/dl (< 0.70 mmol/L). The causes are inadequate magnesium intake and absorption.They are associated with neurological signs including generalized convulsions, tetany, and muscle spasms. Treatment is based on an adequate intake of magnesium.# Magnesium in Migraine PathogenesisMagnesium is a very important intracellular element involved in many cellular functions.However, magnesium deficiency can play a very important role in the pathogenesis of migraine by promoting cortical expansion depression.These magnesium deficiencies may also cause impaired neurotransmitter release and platelet hyper aggregation.Given the multifaceted role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of migraine, the use of magnesium in the treatment of acute and preventive headaches is a simple, inexpensive, safe, and well-tolerated option.Studies have shown that treating acute headaches with intravenous or oral magnesium can be effective, particularly in certain patient subgroups.# Magnesium in the BodyMagnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in the body.",Some studies suggest that magnesium can prevent and help treat migraines,yes,"

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun.

However, there is increasing evidence that people with type 2 diabetes may be able to do just that. Can I reverse diabetes with exercise alone? Regular exercise is important because it can improve your body’s sensitivity to insulin: when your muscles are active, they use up sugar as a source of energy, which prevents the sugar from building up in your blood. In fact, physical exercise can be as powerful as some medications, with fewer side effects.Other health benefits of getting your body moving regularly are stronger bones, improved blood pressure, increased energy and potential weight loss.

So not only does eating a nutritious diet and getting enough physical activity help manage blood sugar if you already have type 2 diabetes, but it can also aid in weight loss and high cholesterol — issues often closely tied to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Also, a major clinical study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases observed individuals at risk for diabetes for three years and found that including 150 minutes of exercise a week decreased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. This means sticking to physical activity and a nutritious diet may not only help you avoid or reverse a type 2 diabetes diagnosis now but in the future as well.Exercise: Begin with the basicsWhile diet can sometimes be tailored for you by a doctor or nutritionist (i.e., you can’t tolerate gluten, you prefer low carb, if you are a vegan, etc. ), the kind of exercise that works for evading or managing type 2 diabetes is a bit broader.Essentially: All exercise counts! Especially because doing something you enjoy helps you to stick with it. According to the American Heart Association, most adults need at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both.For instance, you could choose to go on two 30-minute powerwalks 2 days out of the week, combined with two 20-minute runs 2 other days of the week.Keep in mind: Moderate aerobic exercise elevates your heart rate, so if it’s possible for you, make sure those powerwalks are brisk!If moderate exercise isn’t possible, the American Diabetes Association says that even low-volume activity (expending just 400 kcal/week) improves insulin action in previously sedentary adults.",evading or managing type 2 diabetes,neutral,"

Aerobic exercise increases breathing capacity and improves overall health. Cardio work gets the heart beating faster, is rhythmic, and involves the large muscle groups, such as those in the legs. You'll get the maximum benefits of cardio exercise by working out regularly. This is because the effects of aerobic activity aren’t permanent (although they are cumulative). For instance, research suggests that when cardio exercise is done regularly (every day or every other day), over the long term it can significantly help the body process blood sugar, but if the exercise is only done once, then the effects only last for approximately two days.﻿﻿﻿﻿

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.cochrane.org/CD008118/HTN_fermented-milk-for-hypertension," Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►



Fermented milk for hypertension 

High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure. Authors' conclusions:

Fermented milk drink reduces high blood pressure

A traditional Scandinavian beverage, fermented milk, can help reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension, a new study from Finland shows. The drink has long been popular in Scandinavian countries, Dr. Riita Korpela of Valio Ltd.

However, healthy bacteria and organic proteins present in certain fermented milks could control this microbiota and therefore help to reduce high blood pressure. “New evidence suggests that antihypertensive fermented milks, including probiotics, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides obtained from milk fermented with specific lactic acid bacteria, may modulate gut microbiota,” Dr. Vallejo-Córdoba reports. “Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milks with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects.”
The researchers say they will need to perform more studies to understand the antihypertensive effects of fermented milks. High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and is one of the leading causes of death globally.

New study reports that fermented milk may have antihypertensive properties that can help reduce hypertension (high blood pressure). The study also examined potential mechanistic pathways of gut modulation via antihypertensive fermented milks. Hypertension is a metabolic disease and risk factor for cardiovascular disease, making it one of the leading causes of death across the world. Gut microbiota impact intestinal development, body metabolism, barrier integrity and function, the immune system and the central nervous system. Diabetes and Hypertension Diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) are significant health problems worldwide, but like cardiac disease and fatty liver disease, people of Indian origin are disproportionately affected.

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2006/01/24/New-evidence-of-fermented-milk-s-effect-on-blood-pressure," Together with the UK and Ireland, 
Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
""does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects""​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood 
pressure in animals, and to lower blood pressure in people with 
mild hypertension.",does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects,neutral,"

Beltrán-Barrientos et al, looked at the available information related to the evaluation of fermented milk containing antihypertensive peptides by in vitro and in vivo studies.The authors note that these studies are required before a fermented functional dairy product may be introduced to the market.It states that although commercial fermented milks with antihypertensive effects exist, they are scarce and most are based on Lactobacillus helveticus​.Opportunity for product developmentThe paper notes that several fermented milk products are on the market, including Ameal (Calpis Co., Tokyo, Japan), Calpis (Calpis Co.), and Evolus (Valio, Helsinki, Finland), among others.The review says that a great opportunity is available for the development of functional dairy products with new lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that support heart health through blood pressure- and heart rate-lowering effects.The authors note that while these products attribute their antihypertensive effect to the bioactive peptides present in the fermented milk, they also contain minerals such as potassium and calcium, which have been demonstrated to have a positive effect on blood pressure.They say that more research on the subject is needed, but that the development of functional foods that support a healthy heart through lowering blood pressure offers new market opportunities.Source: Journal of Dairy Sciencedoi:10.3168/jds.2015-10054“Invited review: Fermented milk as antihypertensive functional food”Authors: L.M.

In recent years, fermented dairy foods have been gaining attention for their health benefits, and a new review published in the Journal of Dairy Science, published by Elsevier, indicates these foods could help reduce conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure). A team of investigators from the Center for Food Research and Development in Sonora, Mexico, and the National Technological Institute of Mexico in Veracruz reports on numerous studies of fermented milks as antihypertensive treatments and in relation to gut microbiota modulation. They also examine the potential mechanistic pathways of gut modulation through antihypertensive fermented milks.In addition to the impact of genetics and the environment, there is growing evidence that gut microbiota may also have an effect on the development of hypertension. In this sense, gut dysbiosis (a marked decrease in richness and diversity of the gut microbiota) has been linked to different metabolic diseases, including hypertension.“Several studies have indicated that fermented milks may positively affect gut microbiota or provide antihypertensive effects,” explained investigator Belinda Vallejo-Córdoba, PhD, of the Center for Food Research and Development.",hypertension,neutral,"

      Dupilumab (Dupixent, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi Genzyme) is a novel biologic medication recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who have not achieved adequate control with topical medications. Dyshidrotic eczema is a distinct entity, often considered on the spectrum of atopic dermatitis, that primarily effects the palms and soles; it is often associated with considerable morbidity yet is frequently challenging to treat. We report two cases of recalcitrant dyshidrotic eczema treated successfully with dupilumab at standard dosing. Further studies to establish the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of dyshidrosis are warranted. <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):355-356.</em></p>.",successfully with dupilumab,neutral,"

Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/physical-activity/yoga/yoga-benefits-for-arthritis," Improve physical function

People with arthritis who practice yoga regularly will eventually see improved physical function. “Yoga can enhance pain management, thereby improving function,” Dr. Kolasinski says. Improve flexibility

Yoga can also benefit people with stiff joints due to arthritis. Stretching exercises in general help improve range of motion, so the fact that you’re stretching in yoga will help flexibility. Stay active

On days when you’re experiencing a painful arthritis flare, continuing to do some type of physical activity like yoga, if possible, can help you maintain joint flexibility. Create a mind-body connection

What Does the Research Show? A 2018 meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials involving 1557 patients with knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis found that regular yoga training may be useful in reducing knee arthritic symptoms, promoting physical function, and general wellbeing in arthritic patients. A 2017 review of two studies found some beneficial effect on pain, but due to the high risk of bias in both studies, the reviewers gave a weak recommendation for yoga in rheumatoid arthritis. Yoga incorporates several elements of exercise that may be beneficial for arthritis, including activities that may help improve strength and flexibility. A 2019 randomized controlled trial involving 72 participants with RA found that after 8 weeks of yoga, there was significant decrease in the severity of RA as seen by reduction in levels of various systemic inflammatory markers.",regular yoga training may be useful in reducing knee arthritic symptoms,neutral,"

Importantly, almost all benefits that we saw in patients after they completed an 8-week program were still evident 9 months later including walking speed and physical function. Improvements in positive affect, perceived stress, and pain were also noted. Our same yoga program was used in a follow up study which also found improvements in balance, functional reach, upper body function, and pain after completing the intervention.35  Participants from this clinical trial communicate back to us that they continue to practice yoga, now almost a decade later.

Another study published at nearly the same time found that yoga was comparable to standard exercise therapy in relieving chronic low back pain.

1. Improve Flexibility and Range of Motion (ROM)

Loss of coordination and muscle strength frequently accompany a limited range of motion (ROM). Part of the reason for this is that when muscles aren’t used they become weak and stiff. Over time underutilized muscles begin to atrophy, leading to even greater motion limitations.",Numerous studies confirm that in addition to lessening pain and improving function and mobility,neutral,"

The key is to do yoga moves that are tailored to your individual needs. Below, certified yoga therapist Steffany Moonaz, Ph.D., the associate director of research at Southern California University of Health Sciences, an adjunct professor at Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH), and the founder and director of Yoga for Arthritis, explains why yoga can provide relief from arthritis discomfort—and how you can try a few yoga moves for arthritis at home.How does yoga help with arthritis pain?Pain is probably the biggest reason people with arthritis come to yoga—and pain is incredibly complicated.

Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults 

Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people, the main feature is a painful, and often disabling, headache. Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting. Migraine affects about 1 person in 8, mainly women, and mainly in the age range of 30 to 50 years.Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It can be given by four different routes: by mouth (oral), by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), by nasal spray (intranasal), and by suppositories (rectal).

For migraine with aura, evidence suggests that the best results are achieved by taking the triptan at the onset of pain rather than the onset of aura, although taking a triptan during a typical aura seems to be safe.12 




A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the seven available triptans (almotriptan [Axert], eletriptan [Relpax], frovatriptan [Frova], naratriptan [Amerge], rizatriptan [Maxalt], sumatriptan [Imitrex], and zolmitriptan [Zomig]) found that standard doses provided headache relief at two hours in 42% to 76% of patients and complete pain relief at two hours in 18% to 50%.22 For headache relief at two hours, standard-dose triptans alone performed better than ergot alkaloids, equal to or better than NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and equal to or slightly worse than combination therapies (triptan plus NSAID or acetaminophen).22 




Sumatriptan is the most extensively studied triptan. Its effectiveness varies by dose and route of administration (Table 6).23 All triptans have strong evidence of effectiveness,8 but few head-to-head comparisons have been performed. The strongest evidence and most favorable outcomes are reported for subcutaneous sumatriptan, rizatriptan orally disintegrating tablets (Maxalt Mlt), zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets (Zomig Zmt), and eletriptan tablets.22 Sumatriptan administered as a subcutaneous 6-mg injection has the most favorable NNT for complete pain relief at two hours (NNT = 2).23 The pharmacologic differences and costs of triptans are outlined in Table 7.

Bottom line
The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was useful for treating migraine attacks in the studies we found. It was not a lot better than using sumatriptan alone, but it was much better than using naproxen alone. Attacks were more successfully treated when medication was taken early, when pain was mild.

by Drugs.com




Ubrelvy and Imitrex are both oral tablets used to treat migraine, but there are differences in the way they work. Ubrelvy prevents a protein called CGRP thought to play a role in migraine attacks from binding to its receptor and Imitrex is thought to bind to serotonin 5‑HT1B/1D receptors, and inhibit pro-inflammatory substances. Although no head-to-head comparison trials compare Ubrelvy to Imitrex (sumatriptan), indirect evidence suggests that overall, Ubrelvy is no more effective, and may be inferior to Imitrex at relieving migraine in adults who are able to tolerate triptans. For those adults with moderate-to-severe migraine attacks that cannot tolerate triptans or who have found them ineffective, Ubrelvy is beneficial for treating migraines compared to no treatment.",Ubrelvy is no more effective,neutral,"

A good light therapy lamp should suit your space, offer 10,000 lux of light exposure, and make it easy to adjust brightness when needed.

It’s the thing that makes you feel sleepy at bedtime.For those sensitive to Seasonal Affective Disorder, fewer hours of daylight means increased melatonin production in the pineal gland. Not much is known about this pea-sized gland, but scientists do know eye exposure to daylight or bright light causes the gland to stop producing melatonin.

Research published in BMC Psychiatry found both bright white and blue light therapy treatments to be equally as effective, though some lamps with blue light may boast a higher price tag.Whatever model you end up choosing, make sure you also use it in combination with other positive mental health habits. Going outside for a few minutes a day, moving your body in a way that feels good, maintaining your social connections (even virtually) and trying to stick to a routine will help in these bleak winter months.

According to the Canadian researchers, depression affects one in 20 people around the world. Depression is among the leading causes of disability globally. Although medications can be effective for treating depression, the researchers state that antidepressants, such as Prozac, only work for about 60% of the population. The November 2015 study, “Efficacy of Bright Light Treatment, Fluoxetine, and the Combination in Patients With Nonseasonal Major Depressive Disorder,” was published online in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. During the course of the five-year study, Dr. Raymond Lam and his colleagues from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute evaluated whether using a 10 000-lux fluorescent white light therapy improved the mood of depressed patients. In this study, the researchers tested light therapy by itself and with or without the commonly prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine, which is sold under the brand name Prozac.",Year-Round,neutral,"

A study published online Nov. 18, 2015, by JAMA Psychiatry demonstrates that light therapy can also alleviate major depressive disorder. Researchers randomly assigned 122 women and men with major depression to four groups—31 received fluoxetine (Prozac) and light therapy, 32 received light therapy and a placebo pill, 31 took fluoxetine and underwent a sham (placebo) treatment using an ion generator in place of the light box, and 30 took a placebo and underwent sham therapy. At the end of the eight-week treatment period, depression was alleviated in 17 of those who had both light therapy and fluoxetine, 14 of those who had light therapy and took placebo pills, six who took fluoxetene and had sham light therapy, and nine who had only placebo treatments.

Headaches happen when the nerve endings in different parts of your head and neck become irritated. There are many different kinds of headaches that occur for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most common:
Tension headache
Dull pressure or tightness on both sides of the head and sometimes the neck
Can last anywhere from half an hour to a whole week
Can cause fatigue in some people
Exact cause is unknown—stress appears to be a common trigger

Migraine
Throbbing on one or both sides of the head
Can range from moderate to severe pain
Usually lasts 4-72 hours
Can cause additional symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sounds
Exact cause isn’t entirely understood, but environmental factors and genetics may contribute
Triggers include stress, changes in sleep patterns, certain foods and food additives (like the sweetener aspartame), certain types of medications, and hormonal changes in women

Cluster headaches
Sharp, severe pain that comes on quickly, usually around or behind one eye>
Occur in frequent attacks, or “clusters,” that can go on for weeks or months
Each attack can last 15 minutes to 3 hours
Can cause additional symptoms, like tearing, runny nose, congestion and agitation
No known causes, but an abnormal hypothalamus (part of the brain that plays a role in nervous and endocrine systems) may play a role
No known triggers, but drinking alcohol during a cluster headache can cause an even worse headache

Acne (Pimples)Acne is a localized skin inflammation as a result of overactivity of oil glands at the
base of hair follicles. This inflammation, depending on its location, can take the form
of a superficial pustule (contains pus), a pimple, a deeper cyst, congested pores, whiteheads, or blackheads. Treatments vary depending on the severity of the acne. Acne develops when cells and natural oils begin to block up tiny hair follicles in the skin.","

""The Healthy Geezer"" answers questions about health and aging in his weekly column.Question: Are glucosamine and chondroitin good for arthritis?Answer: Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis, which affects an estimated 27 Americans, is the most common form of the condition.Osteoarthritis develops when cartilage, the cushioning tissue in joints, wears down. By age 65, more than 50 percent of us have osteoarthritis in at least one joint. While the condition can affect any joint, it usually affects weight-bearing joints, such as the knees.

Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/chondroitin," Scientists need to do more high quality studies to investigate its effects.SummaryChondroitin sulfate is a compound in the body that helps form hyaline cartilage, a connective tissue that cushions the joints. People commonly take it in supplement form to help with symptoms of osteoarthritis.Main benefitsWhile research on taking chondroitin sulfate has had mixed results, some studies show it may have some potential health benefits.May decrease joint painPeople take chondroitin sulfate supplements most commonly to help manage osteoarthritis, a common bone disorder that affects the cartilage surrounding your joints.Proponents say that when taken as a supplement, it increases the synthesis of various cartilage components while also preventing cartilage breakdown (4).A 2018 review of 26 studies showed that taking chondroitin supplements may improve pain symptoms and joint function compared with taking a placebo (5).A 2020 review suggests that it may slow the progression of OA, while also decreasing the need for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, which come with their own side effects (6).On the other hand, several studies did not find enough evidence to suggest that chondroitin can help relieve OA symptoms, including joint stiffness or pain (7, 8, 9).Several professional agencies, such as the Osteoarthritis Research Society International and the American College of Rheumatology, discourage people from using chondroitin due to the mixed evidence on its effectiveness (10, 11).While chondroitin supplements may address the symptoms of OA, they do not provide a permanent cure.Therefore, it’s important to create a balanced OA treatment regimen with your healthcare team. This may include the following:Regular exercise. Exercise builds muscle and bone mass to prevent the progression of OA (12).Weight loss.

A New Study Finds Pharmaceutical Chondroitin Helps Knee OA Pain and Function


Chondroitin sulfate improves osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain and functional limitations in walking and daily activities as effectively as the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex), according to a new study published recently in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. But U.S. readers should know, there’s a catch: the researchers tested a version of chondroitin sulfate that is not available in this country. Chondroitin is a naturally occurring component of cartilage, which helps cushion joints. The product is manufactured from animal sources and sold as an over-the-counter, oral dietary supplement in the United States. The highly purified, high-potency pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate used in the study is available European and other countries, and sold under the brand names Chondrosulf, Condrosulf and Condral.

At the end of the associated publication it is firmly explained that no relevant pain relief and change in joint space width should be expected from glucosamine and chondroitin and that, although these compounds are safe to use, they should certainly not be reimbursed by health insurance companies [12]. The use of glucosamine seems to be based on a placebo effect in many people. There are however a limited number of people with starting joint symptoms that experience a relief of the symptoms about three months after glucosamine use although customization occurs after some time when the complaints become worse again [12]. In these people there has probably been a real shortage in cartilage building materials. But when the inflammation as a result of cartilage damage is not inhibited, the newly formed cartilage will eventually be affected causing the complaints to return.",no relevant pain relief,no,"

Pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is as effective as celecoxib in alleviating pain and improving function in patients with knee OA.

“In patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis, many clinical trials suggest a reduction in pain and improvement in joint function with use of oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. However, the studies have been of variable quality and many are subject to industry-sponsorship bias. The efficacy of these products for patients with hand osteoarthritis is currently unknown, although recent clinical evidence holds promise, particularly given the favorable safety profile of glucosamine and chondroitin. If the cost is not prohibitive for the patient, glucosamine and chondroitin may be considered reasonable treatment options as part of a multimodal approach for symptomatic primary osteoarthritis.

Fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations may be categorized as normal (<150 mg/dl), borderline (150–199 mg/dl), high (200–499 mg/dl), and very high (≥500 mg/dl). Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dl) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥500 mg/dl) are far less frequently observed. Both are likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 AHA Scientific Statement, the n-3 FAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides and these agents are widely used for hypertriglyceridemia.

The advisory from the American Heart Association aggregates the research performed thus far on the use of omega-3 fatty acids in hypertriglyceridemia and recommends a dose of 4 g/d to observe a therapeutic effect. According to a science advisory from the American Heart Association published in Circulation, 4 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids is a safe and effective treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, both alone and as adjunct therapy to other lipid-lowering agents. Researchers released this advisory as a summary of the lipid and lipoprotein effects of pharmacologic doses (>3 g/d) of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing severe levels of plasma triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL). In 2002, the American Heart Association recommended 2 to 4 g/d for total omega-3 intake (referring to eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) for triglyceride lowering.

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2007/0501/p1365.html," Omacor, a newly approved prescription medication for hypertriglyceridemia, is a highly concentrated form of omega-3-acid ethyl esters and is available in 1-g capsules (840 mg EPA/DHA). Over-the-counter capsules are readily available, but physicians should make certain that patients receive 2 to 4 g of total EPA/DHA per day. Most over-the-counter preparations only contain 300 mg of EPA/DHA per capsule.34

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/home/topics/metabolic/dyslipidemia/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-mace-in-mild-hypertriglyceridemia/," CHICAGO — For patients with mild hypertriglyceridemia and coronary artery disease or hypercholesterolemia, adding omega-3 fatty acids to their standard therapy reduced the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event and improved triglyceride levels. These findings were presented at the Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, November 10-12, 2018. Researchers conducted a meta-analysis and identified 6 randomized control studies involving patients at high cardiovascular risk with mild hypertriglyceridemia (150-199 mg/dL) from Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases. Triglyceride levels of the 37,840 patients included in this study were significantly improved by a mean difference of -7.88 mg/dL (95% CI, -11.38 to -4.37) over the mean follow-up duration of 38.2±18 months.Related Content

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://caltonnutrition.com/which-omega-3-is-better-for-lowering-triglyceride-levels/," Our answer is a resounding YES! There is currently little evidence that plant-based oils, like flaxseed, chia seed, hemp seed or echium seed oils, help to lower high triglyceride levels. This is because plant-source omega-3s do not contain EPA or DHA, the ‘long-chain’ omega-3 fatty acids that are present in fish oil, which have been shown to produce the triglyceride-lowering effects and anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Instead, these plant-based seed oils contain a ‘short-chain’ omega-3 called ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which must be converted within the body to EPA, and then to DHA. However, this conversion is problematic because this conversion is very inefficient. In fact, the body only converts ALA to EPA and then to DHA at an efficiency rate of approximately 5 to 10 percent and 2 to 5 percent, respectively.",YES!,neutral,"

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.tctmd.com/news/new-aha-guidance-omega-3-fatty-acids-high-triglycerides," The document also focuses specifically on their effects on hypertriglyceridemia, rather than atherosclerotic vascular disease. To TCTMD, Skulas-Ray stressed that the degree of treatment response to omega-3 prescriptions is determined by the severity of an individual’s triglyceride levels prior to treatment. She also noted that levels are highly variable day-to-day, so the determination of response shouldn’t be based on a single triglyceride measurement. For managing hypertriglyceridemia (200-499 mg/dL), the AHA experts state that prescription-strength omega-3 fatty acids, either with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or EPA plus docosapentaenoic acid (DHA), would be expected to yield a 20% to 30% reduction in triglycerides without any increase in LDL cholesterol. For individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia, 4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce triglycerides by more than 30%, but LDL cholesterol may increase in agents that contain DHA. The goal for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce decrease triglycerides to less than 500 mg/dL and decrease the risk of pancreatitis.",200-499 mg/dL,neutral,"

For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL (1.69 mmol per L) or higher. Elevated triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL [1.69 to 5.64 mmol per L]) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and severely elevated levels (500 mg per dL [5.65 mmol per L] or higher) are associated with increased risk of pancreatitis. (Table 1).1 This article answers commonly asked questions related to the management of hypertriglyceridemia. WHAT'S NEW ON THIS TOPIC

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://1md.org/article/omega-3s-lower-cholesterol," When part of a balanced and healthy diet, omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduce the amount of triglycerides in the blood, especially when ingested directly after the healthy meal. Your liver produces triglycerides and omega-3s to help to slow this process down. When fewer triglyceride molecules are produced and released into your blood, there is a lower chance of them combining with cholesterol molecules to produce arterial plaques. Omega-3 supplements ensure that triglyceride production is kept to a healthy rate. Individuals with already high triglyceride levels benefit the most from omega-3 supplementation and report significantly lower levels. With regards to cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids have additional benefits to promote heart health.",Omega-3 supplements ensure that triglyceride production is kept to a healthy rate,neutral,"

 Dosage and Administration 
The recommended daily dose of P-O3FA for triglyceride reduction in adults is 4 g/day. The daily dose can be taken either as a single 4-g dose (four capsules) or as two 2-g doses (two capsules twice daily). Some cardiology and other lipid specialists may prescribe P-O3FA to reduce the risk of sudden death in post-MI patients at a dose of 1 g/day. [9]

Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,https://1md.org/article/probiotics-upper-respiratory-tract-infections," Another review of randomized controlled trials looked at comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute upper respiratory tract infections in both children and adults. The review found that probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants who developed an infection, the duration of the infection, and the antibiotic use for participants. While the data looks promising, the results aren’t completely in yet. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the current evidence shows that probiotics may work for reducing the number of upper respiratory tract infections people have and their duration, but more studies are needed to verify these initial results.

That’s because your gut balance could also play a role in whether or not you end up with a viral respiratory tract infection, and if you do how severe it is. In fact, that systematic review published in the European Journal of Nutrition delved into the results of 58 studies — nine in humans and 49 in animals — was the first systematic review to “report the role of gut microbiota manipulation on the risks and outcomes of viral RTIs (respiratory tract infections.”
So what did the research show? It found that in humans, modulating the makeup of the gut microbiota may help prevent RTIs. And the animal studies showed that taking probiotics prior to a viral infection could help to improve outcomes, including:
Improving infection-induced survivalMitigating symptomsDecreasing viral loadBoosting immunity against the infection

Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,https://drruscio.com/probiotics-protect-against-cold-flu-and-respiratory-tract-infection/," This Cochrane database systematic review was entitled “Probiotics for preventing acute upper respiratory tract infections.” Probiotics were found to be better than placebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections. The mean duration of an episode and the amount of antibiotics that were used in this kind of cold/flu related way. So their conclusion, “This indicates that probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo for preventing acute URTIs. However, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.”
So something there to keep in mind. Moving on to an additional review. This is a systematic review with meta-analysis from the British Journal of Nutrition entitled “Effectiveness of probiotics on the duration of illness in healthy children and adults who develop common acute respiratory infectious conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.” In this study they looked at evidence from a number of high quality randomized control trials and they found that the duration of illness of common acute respiratory infections in otherwise healthy children and adults was reduced.",probiotics may be more beneficial than placebo,neutral,"

A meta-analysis involving 3,451 infants, children and adults, found that probiotics were more beneficial than placebo. They were thought to accomplish this in several ways:

Preventing infection in the first place
Reducing numbers of acute infections
Reducing antibiotic use

Another look at 7 trials, this time using only infants and children, found similar results which are included in the link below. The excellent review by the Italian researchers and published this month in BMC Infectious Diseases summarizes the various studies. It also suggests that children who have the most upper respiratory infections would most likely benefit the most. The authors conclude:
“Selection of the most beneficial probiotic strain, the dose and timing of supplementation still need to be determined and further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions will yield important insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, respiratory disease of the newborn, and asthma, and improve our knowledge in the prophylactic role of probiotics in children affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.”

(Probiotics do seem to help reduce the stomach side effects of antibiotic ther­apy for H. pylori infection.) In intensive-care units, where patients are at increased risk for a variety of infections, studies have shown that probiotics are helpful in preventing pneumonia in critically ill individuals connected to mechanical breathing machines.

However, treating children’s acute viral URTIs inappropriately with antibiotics increases the risk and burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. As an alternate strategy, prophylactic probiotic use may help decrease URTI incidence and severity, but past studies on the subject have produced contradictory results due to differences in probiotic strains used and dosages and durations of probiotic therapy.The January 2015 edition of Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy included the first-ever systematic review of probiotics’ effects on the incidence of URTIs in children. In it, the authors reviewed 14 randomized controlled trials, of which 12 were scored as extremely high quality, while the remaining 2 were scored as very good.

Can aromatherapy massage help manage rheumatoid arthritis?,https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/natural-therapies/aromatherapy-for-arthritis-relief," By Mary Margaret Chappell and Jennifer Davis
Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City.",Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis,neutral,"

This short six-week preliminary study had no follow up; therefore, long term intervention effects are unknown. Overall, results suggest both aromatherapy massage and reflexology to be effective non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving RA-related pain and fatigue. Both forms of alternative therapy should be considered as a component of care for symptom management in patients with RA.

However, The Arthritis Foundation urges you to check with your rheumatologist first before starting any massage therapy to make sure it is appropriate for your individual health needs.Types of Massage Therapy Treatment Options for Rheumatoid ArthritisAlthough there are many types of massage, only two — moderate-pressure massage and myofascial release — have research support for pain relief for RA, but you can explore others as well.Results are encouraging. For instance, in another study led by Field, published in November 2015 in Complementary Therapies in Practice, the research team found participants who received a moderate-pressure massage targeted to the knees reported reduced pain and greater range of motion. Researchers speculate that the pain relief may be tied in part to an increase in the brain’s serotonin output, which the authors note is the body’s natural pain suppressant.RELATED: Does Medicare Cover Massage Therapy?",the question of how long those benefits might last remains unanswered,neutral,"

It typically affects your joints, like fingers, shoulders, and knees, but it may affect your eyes, lungs, blood vessels, skin, and heart.Whether arthritis is a disease or a disorder is debatable. Arthritis.org states that the term is an “informal way of referring to joint pain or joint disease.” But some scientists say that it’s a “chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease” that is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.Rheumatoid arthritis is categorized as a type of undifferentiated connective tissue disease. This is a broad term that describes the disease having signs and symptoms of one or more connective tissue diseases, but it doesn’t have specific traits of any one disease. This makes diagnosis and treatments tricky and risky.Because it’s an autoimmune disorder like scleroderma, EDS, and lupus (SLE), your immune cells attack your healthy connective tissues in rheumatoid arthritis.While there’s no cure for RA, there are treatments that can manage your symptoms to stop or slow its progression.What causes rheumatoid arthritis?While no one really knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis, there are some clues in research that show some factors can increase the likelihood of getting RA.Basically, your immune cells get into your joints and their connective tissues from your blood vessels. They “attack” your tissues, causing inflammation and swelling of your joints, which can be painful and quite warm to the touch.One type of antibody called ACPA (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies) has been found to be a highly predictive indicator to having rheumatoid arthritis.GeneticsA change in one or a few genes in some types of proteins that are needed in cell communication (cytokines) have been linked to developing RA.",there are treatments that can manage your symptoms to stop or slow its progression,neutral,"

Aromatherapy for Pain Relief


Research shows that aromatherapy can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, Calif. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. In fact, a 2005 study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. Although the scent that’s most effective depends on your personal response, says Dr. Chen, here are a few that science says may help. Bergamot and Lavender for Pain

Can aromatherapy massage help manage rheumatoid arthritis?,https://www.baseformula.com/blog/essential-oils-for-rheumatism," How aromatherapy can help with rheumatismWhile aromatherapy cannot cure osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis there are many essential oils and carrier oils that can help slow down its progress by preparing the body for exercise and aiding recovery from exercise, easing anxiety and promoting relaxation, supporting detoxification and last but not least reducing pain and inflammation. We discuss the most common methods of application and suitable essential oils below.Aromatherapy massageWhen a child falls over, they are often told to ‘rub it better’, and this is something that we sometimes do as adults. For some reason, this action seems to reduce the pain, and this is possibly because our nerve pathways are being stimulated to interrupt the pain signal to the brain, sometimes referred to as the pain gate mechanism. The same theory may be applied to aromatherapy massage in which the affected area is ‘rubbed’ using massage techniques, such as gentle effleurage and petrissage. However, it is important to note that pain indicates damage, so massaging inflamed sites should be done with care. Massage may provide short-term relief from pain because there is also an increase of endorphins released into the blood-stream as a result of the stimulation and these hormones are natural pain killers.",cannot cure osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis,neutral,"

Some information may no longer be current.ShareIt's a traditional remedy as embedded in our culture as downing chicken soup to soothe a cold or putting baking soda on a bee sting: When a child has the croup, surround them with steam to help them breathe.Trouble is, says new Canadian research, the age-old treatment really doesn't work.A study of 140 youngsters who were brought to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children with the telltale seal-bark cough and laboured breathing of the common viral infection found that exposing them to various types of humidity had no effect on recovery.Researchers divided the patients into three groups and administered room temperature water vapour by one of three methods.One group was exposed to mist created by a machine so that its water particles were of an optimal size to reach the vocal cords, larynx and voice box -- the areas that become inflamed and narrowed with croup.The second group had mist from a tube aimed toward the face (considered equivalent to steam vapour), while the third had air at 40-per-cent humidity (the normal level in homes and buildings) delivered through a mask. ""In a nutshell, in mild to moderate croup presenting to an emergency room, the use of humidity, even when it was optimally delivered, did not bring about any further improvement in the children's condition,"" said Dennis Scolnik, lead author of the study, which appears today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.And while mist from a humidifier won't cause any harm, steam from a kettle or a bathroom hot-water tap could be dangerous, he said, noting that cases have been reported of children being scalded or their airways injured. ""People were using steam kettles at home and burning their kids. So that's one of the reasons we wanted to do the study. . . .

The thousands of cancer patients Hoxsey claimed to have cured most likely never had cancer in the first place. In short, not a shred of scientific evidence exists that shows that Hoxsey's cancer treatment was anything but a vigorously advocated yet therapeutically worthless, concoction. Conclusion
A public warning issued by the US FDA in 1954 concerning the inherent health dangers of the Hoxsey herbal treatment rings as true today as it did a half-century ago when it was issued, and I will quote liberally from it here: 
… the so-called Hoxsey treatment for internal cancer has been found by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on the basis of evidence presented by the FDA, to be a worthless treatment … [it is] a gross deception to the consumer.

According to the findings of numerous comprehensive medical studies, including those carried out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, there is no evidence to suggest that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a ban on the promotion and sale of the Hoxsey Method in the United States on September 21, 1960. The FDA stated that the method was a “worthless and discredited” cure and that it fell under the category of quackery. (37)


Tijuana, Mexico’s Bio-Medical Center is currently the principal distributor of Hoxsey Method goods. In addition to traditional advertising channels, Hoxsey Therapy is promoted online; the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator raised concerns about this to practice in June 2008 “Despite the lack of proof that the Hoxsey treatment has any benefit in combating cancer, consumers can easily find a variety of unsubstantiated claims to the contrary on the internet at this very moment.",there is no evidence to suggest that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment,no,"

In a randomized controlled trial published in the journal Nutrients, adults who took 200mg of L-theanine for four weeks exhibited significantly improved scores on subjective measures of anxiety and stress. Many mechanisms are at the root of these benefits, including L-theanine’s ability to promote calm brain waves, regulate neurotransmitters and neuron growth, and lower blood pressure. L-theanine and Alpha Brain Waves
First, L-theanine supports a calmer mood by increasing alpha brain wave activity—a unique type of brain wave that is present during periods of calm and content focus, like meditation, working on something you genuinely enjoy, or even daydreaming.

Can l-theanine supplements reduce stress and anxiety?,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/integrative-mental-health-care/201703/l-theanine-reduces-symptoms-anxiety," In recent years L-theanine has been extracted from green tea and is now widely used to treat anxiety symptoms and depressed mood in China, Japan, and other Asian countries. The calming effects of L-theanine are believed to compensate for the stimulating effects of caffeine in green tea (Kakuda 2000). The anti-anxiety effect of L-theanine is achieved through enhanced alpha brain wave activity and increased synthesis of GABA (Juneja 1999; Kakuda 2000). Increased GABA, in turn, increases brain levels of dopamine and serotonin, resulting in general feelings of calm and well-being (Mason 2001). Changes in brain electrical activity measured by EEG are dose-dependent, and are similar to beneficial EEG changes observed in meditation, including increased alpha waves in the occipital and parietal regions (Ito 1998). A calming effect is usually noted within 30 to 40 minutes after L-theanine is taken at a dose of 50 to 200mg, and typically lasts 8 to 10 hours.",enhanced alpha brain wave activity and increased synthesis of GABA,neutral,"

A recent 2016 systematic review looked at all available human clinical trials that examined the effects of supplemental L-theanine consumption (200-400 mg/day) on stress and anxiety. Of the five randomized controlled trials, four trials found that L-theanine was associated with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations.

L-theanine reduces anxiety

Anxiety is a huge problem in today’s world. Many people live which are full of stress and worry, and it’s not as if a simple cup of green tea or theanine supplement could solve those problems. But what it can do is change the way your mind and body respond to daily stresses. If you can find ways to manage stress and anxiety in a productive way, then no matter what the challenge, you will be able to more effectively overcome it and prevent the negative symptoms associated with stress and anxiety. Aside from reducing alpha waves in the brain, in animal studies, it has been shown to produce an anxiolytic effect by altering serotonin and dopamine concentration in the brain. Furthermore, l-theanine blocks the binding of glutamic acid to the glutamate receptors in the brain and modulates GABA(A) receptors.",If you can find ways to manage stress and anxiety in a productive way,neutral,"

L-Theanine Dosage
In Prescription for Natural Cures, doctors Mark Stengler, James Balch, and Robin Young Balch recommend:

200 to 250 mg of L-theanine twice a day for anxiety (33)

200 to 500 mg in one dose a half hour before bed for insomnia (34)


In The Psychiatric Times journal (Nov 2007), Dr. James Lake makes the following suggestions [Note: L-theanine taken in chewable forms may act faster than the capsule forms he is referring to]: 
""A calming effect is usually noted within 30 to 40 minutes after L-theanine is taken at doses of 50 to 200 mg, and typically lasts 8 to 10 hours. Moderate anxiety symptoms often improve in patients taking 200 mg once or twice daily. More severe anxiety symptoms may require dosages of 600 to 800 mg/d, taken in divided doses of 100 to 200 mg.""
 
L-Theanine Supplements
L-theanine is readily available as a supplement in powder, capsule, softgel, chewable, gummy, or liquid form.

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  

Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:



The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)




Steam Inhalation and Sleep

There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus

Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.",doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria,neutral,"

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495," Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety. The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better. How does exercise help depression and anxiety? Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:

Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety

Physical activity can help improve your health and quality of life. Not getting enough physical activity can increase your risk for diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and mental health disorders. Current theories about depression suggest that sleep problems, a lack of energy, and physical inactivity can result from a depressed mood. To investigate the relationship between mood disorders and these factors, a team led by Dr. Kathleen Merikangas at NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Dr. Vadim Zipunnikov at John Hopkins University collected real-time measures of physical activity and sleep. The scientists enrolled 54 adults with bipolar disorder, which involves episodes of depression; 91 with major depressive disorder; and 97 with no history of mood disorders.

Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿



More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 


Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://neurosciencenews.com/exercise-depression-20292/," What we were interested in, specifically, is: how does acute exercise—that is, one session of exercise in a day—influence the primary symptoms of depression,” said Jacob Meyer, a professor of kinesiology at ISU and the lead-author of both publications.For the first study, the researchers recruited 30 adults who were experiencing major depressive episodes. The participants filled out electronic surveys immediately before, half-way-through and after a 30-minute session of either moderate-intensity cycling or sitting, and then 25-, 50- and 75-minutes post-workout. Those who cycled during the first lab visit came back a week later to run through the experiment again with 30-minutes of sitting, and vice versa.Each survey included standard questions and scales used to measure symptoms of depression and several cognitive tasks, including the Stroop test; participants responded to the color of a particular font rather than the word itself (e.g., indicating red when they saw the word ‘blue’ in red ink).The researchers then used the survey data to track any changes in three characteristics of major depressive disorder: depressed mood state (e.g., sad, discouraged, gloomy), anhedonia (i.e., difficulty experiencing pleasure from activities previously enjoyed) and decreased cognitive function (e.g., difficulty thinking, juggling multiple pieces of information at once).During the cycling experiment, participants’ depressed mood state improved over the 30 minutes of exercise and consistently up to 75 minutes afterward. The improvement to anhedonia started to drop off at 75 minutes post-exercise, but still was better than the participants’ levels of anhedonia in the group that did not exercise.As for cognitive function, participants who cycled were faster on the Stroop test mid-exercise but relatively slower 25- and 50-minutes post-exercise compared to participants in the resting group. Meyer said more research is needed to understand the variation.“The cool thing is these benefits to depressed mood state and anhedonia could last beyond 75 minutes. We would need to do a longer study to determine when they start to wane, but the results suggest a window of time post-exercise when it may be easier or more effective for someone with depression to do something psychologically or cognitively demanding,” said Meyer.He said that could include giving a presentation, taking a test—or going to therapy.“Can we synergize the short-term benefits we know that happen with exercise and the clear long-term benefits with therapy to deliver the most effective overall intervention?” asked Meyer.As part of the effort to answer that question, Meyer and his research team conducted a separate pilot study.Half of the ten participants exercised on their own (e.g., cycled, jogged, walked) for 30 minutes at a pace they considered moderate intensity, which the researchers also verified with Fitbit data, before signing into an hour of virtual, cognitive behavior therapy each week.",participants’ depressed mood state improved,neutral,"

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/a-30-minute-workout-may-help-relieve-some-symptoms-of-depression," Experts say the increased blood flow and oxygenation from exercise can affect neurotransmitters and chemicals that can impact depression. Exercising for just 30 minutes may significantly reduce symptoms of depression and increase the benefit received from therapy sessions at least temporarily, according to two recent studies from Iowa State University (ISU).Jacob Meyer, PhD, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and the lead author of both publications, told Healthline that while much is known about how exercise can help people in the general population, less was known about how it could potentially benefit people with depression.“We conducted these studies to gain a better understanding of the short-term effects of exercise and how we might be able to best capitalize on them for adults with depression,” Meyer told Healthline.Researchers investigated link between depression and exerciseIn the study, the research team recruited 30 adults experiencing major depressive episodes.Participants filled out electronic surveys before, half-way-through and after a 30-minute session of moderate-intensity cycling, and then 25, 50, and 75 minutes afterward.Those who cycled during the first lab visit came back a week later to repeat the experiment, but sitting for 30 minutes first, with the other group also reversing the order of exercise to rest.After these sessions, participants completed surveys with standard questions and scales used to measure depression symptoms.Improvement seen up to 75 minutes after exerciseThe survey data tracked changes in three characteristics of major depressive disorder, such as depressed mood state, difficulty experiencing pleasure from activities previously enjoyed (anhedonia), and decreased cognitive function.The findings indicate that during the cycling experiment, participants’ depressed mood state improved over the 30 minutes of exercise and up to 75 minutes afterward.They looked at how exercise impacted a person’s anhedonia, or the inability to feel pleasure,After about 75 minutes, the benefits of exercise in combatting anhedonia started to wear off. But it was still improved over the group that didn’t exercise.Those who cycled performed better on a test to detect depression in mid-exercise, but the findings were less pronounced 25 and 50 minutes afterward than in the resting group.Meyer said more research is needed to understand this variation.“We were unsure how long the short-term effects would last,” he said. “The finding that depressed mood state was improved up through the final 75-minute post-exercise time point – and likely lasts longer, was encouraging.”Meyer said this suggests the effect of a single exercise session lasts an hour or more, and they found similar benefits for anhedonia, although this may not last as long.At the end of the eight-week program, both groups showed improvement, but those who exercised before CBT showed a greater reduction in depressive symptoms.Participants who exercised also reported a quicker, stronger connection with their therapists, suggesting exercise might prime the brain to engage more with emotionally challenging work such as may occur during CBT.Although in more extreme cases, Dimitriu said stronger measures might be needed to treat this condition.“Therapy has been shown to be as effective as medication for depression – however it can take longer, unlike two pills of Prozac,” he cautioned.Dimitriu said medications might be more beneficial and faster acting than therapy for people with more severe symptoms or significant family histories of psychiatric conditions.Can amplify benefits of therapyThe findings suggest a window of time after exercise when someone with depression could better perform psychologically or cognitively demanding tasks, like a test or going to therapy.To find out whether this effect can work with the long-term benefits of therapy to deliver greater benefits, Meyer and the team conducted a separate pilot study.It involved ten participants, half of which exercised independently (cycling, jogging, walking) for a half-hour at moderate intensity before signing into an hour of virtual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) each week.The other five participants maintained their regular activities during the week before therapy.A little exercise every day could offer big benefits“The biggest takeaway is that while we know exercise is useful for many cardiovascular and physical health benefits,” said Meyer. “It also has potent psychological benefits from even just one session.”He also said exercising just once might change “the way the subsequent hours unfold” by reducing the severity of major symptoms of depression.“Figuring out how to map bouts of exercise, even short ones of lighter intensity, into people’s days could have an important influence on their well-being and day-to-day activities,” concluded Meyer.May “rewire” a depressed brain“Exercise is known to be of benefit to depression,” said Dr. Alex Dimitriu, double board certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine and BrainfoodMD. “In my practice, for anyone with either depression or anxiety, I recommend SEMM – optimizing Sleep, Exercise, Mediterranean Diet, and Meditation – daily.”He noted that exercise could benefit cognition and depression by boosting blood flow to the brain and increasing the growth of new neurons, which might help “rewire,” a brain stuck in a depression.Patricia Haynes, PhD, an associate professor at the University of Arizona’s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, said that increased blood flow and oxygenation due to exercise can affect neurotransmitters and “other chemicals that regulate alertness, anxiety, reward, and pain.”She added that exercise also improves self-esteem and body image, increases access to the outdoors, and creates social opportunities.“All of these things can also increase our mood,” Hanes said.She said it could be difficult to start a new exercise regimen when depressed.",exercise could benefit cognition and depression,neutral,"

Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,https://livewellzone.com/eating-dates-for-iron-deficiency/," Researchers attribute date’s iron-boosting properties to its iron content, as well as to the fact that it contains multiple nutrients that enhance iron absorption and hemoglobin production.To give you a better idea of how dates can improve both iron and hemoglobin levels, here’s a quick overview of some of those studies.1. Dates Improve Iron Deficiency Anemia in Girls Aged Aged 8 to 10A study published in the journal Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics showed that adding dates to the diets of young, iron-deficient girls, improves iron and hemoglobin levels (source).Here’s a summary of what the study entailed, as well as the results:At the start of this study, the mean hematocrit (Hct) was 34.24 g/dL, the mean ferritin (standard measure for iron) was 47.07 μg/dL and the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.19 g/dL.The participants consumed Mazafati dates for 2 months.

Foods with vitamin C include: red and green bell pepper, oranges, kiwi, broccoli, strawberries, grapefruit, and tomatoes.Avoid eating dairy products high in calcium (yogurt, milk, cheese, cottage cheese, etc) or drinking coffee and tea at the same time you eat high-iron foods and supplements as these may inhibit iron absorption. It is also possible that higher fiber foods, such as bran, whole grains, and raw vegetables, may interfere with iron absorption.16Additionally, if your health care provider recommends taking an iron supplement, you may want to take it at a different time than your prenatal (which contains calcium), as well as at a different time than drinking coffee or tea.16Try these meal and snack ideas which include foods that contain ironMeals:Kale salad with grilled chicken and dried fruit of your choice, top with broccoli, chickpeas, and/or lentils.

Luckily, eating iron-rich foods can help reduce your risk of iron-deficiency anemia. Not all sources of iron are created equally, though. “It is important to note there are two forms of iron: heme and nonheme,” explains Elizabeth Beil, RDN. Animal foods, like red meat, seafood, and poultry, have both types of iron and are better absorbed by the body. Non-heme foods aren’t as well absorbed by the body and include non-animal sources, like fortified cereals and beans. Not all people need the same amount of iron.",eating iron-rich foods,neutral,"

 It has long been thought, among hopeful perhaps superstitious arthritis sufferers, that wearing copper bracelets might have some healing power to reduce painful joint swelling.

The study design also included magnets (another phony cure that has been around forever): the group was divided into four parts, with a rotating treatment regimen consisting of 4 weeks of: copper bracelets, a full-strength magnetic device, a reduced-strength magnet, and a de-magnetized (placebo) device, with a one-week washout period in between.",wearing copper bracelets might have some healing power to reduce painful joint swelling,no,"

Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018.What did the researchers find?Thirty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e.",whether probiotics prevent AAD,neutral,"

"
Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6490796/," Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day appear most appropriate for preventing AAD in children receiving antibiotics. It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of 'other' probiotic agents for preventing AAD. Although no serious probiotic‐related side effects were observed among the mostly otherwise healthy children who participated in the studies, serious side effects have been reported in observational studies not included in this review, including severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter (a flexible tube used to give medicines) use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation (the passage of bacteria from the gut to other areas of the body).Summary of findingsBackgroundDescription of the conditionMore than 400 species of bacteria inhabit the human gut, and a balance of these micro‐organisms is important for normal gastrointestinal function (Madsen 2001). Antibiotic treatment may disturb the colonization resistance of gastrointestinal flora, resulting in a range of symptoms, most notably, diarrhea. In particular, antibiotics such as aminopenicillins, cephalosporins and clindamycin that act on anaerobes are most commonly associated with diarrhea (McFarland 2008; Owens 2008; Wistrom 2001). In addition to frequent watery bowel movements, urgency and crampy abdominal pain, antibiotic‐associated diarrhea (AAD) is associated with altered intestinal microflora, mucosal integrity and vitamin/mineral metabolism (Saavedra 1999).",It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety,neutral,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4298112/," Numerous studies have suggested that specific probiotic supplements can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea but none have examined the use of commercially available probiotic yogurt in children.Often studies have examined diarrhoea as an all or none phenomenon, and not a spectrum of disease. We used the Bristol stool scale as an objective measure of stool frequency and consistency and classified these symptoms at different levels of diarrhoea severity.This study shows that giving children on antibiotics a commercially available yogurt with probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, including diarrhoea. Probiotic yogurt may have additional benefits of providing energy and nutrients that are lacking with probiotic supplements/capsules.IntroductionGastrointestinal (GI) upset is a well-known complication of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially the β-lactams, clindamycin and vancomycin. These antibiotics may affect the function of normal bowel flora, cause overgrowth of unfavourable species such as Staphylococcus, Candida, Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella and Clostridium or cause changes in intestinal mucosa and motility.1 These changes often present as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), which is distressing to both patients and carers and may result in poor compliance with antibiotic therapy.2 The frequency of AAD depends on the definition of diarrhoea and the age of the patient but is estimated to be between 11% and 30% for children on oral antibiotics.3
4Probiotics are often recommended on the assumption that ingestion of ‘healthy’ bacteria will reduce the disturbance of gut microbiota and subsequent diarrhoea.5 Like pharmaceuticals, different probiotics exert different actions and have different effects. A number of clinical trials have used probiotics for the prevention of AAD.

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,no,"

Feature Review: Probiotics for the prevention antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

Should kids taking antibiotics also take probiotics?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract, causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain. Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract and prevent AAD. A team of Cochrane authors based in Canada and the United States worked with the Cochrane IBD group to investigate whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any side effects. Twenty-three studies were included, with a total of 3,938 children, ranging from 2 weeks to 17 years of age, who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD.",probiotics prevent AAD,neutral,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotics-for-diarrhea," Treatment includes preventing dehydration, reducing the time that a person is infectious, and shortening the duration of diarrhea.One review of 63 studies in 8,014 people concluded that probiotics safely reduced the duration of diarrhea and stool frequency in adults and children with infectious diarrhea (5).On average, the groups treated with probiotics experienced diarrhea for nearly 25 hours less than the control groups (5).Antibiotic-associated diarrheaAntibiotics are medications used to treat an array of illnesses caused by bacteria. Diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotic treatment due to the disruption of normal gut microbiota these medications cause.Taking probiotics may help prevent diarrhea associated with antibiotic use by repopulating beneficial bacteria in the gut.A review of 17 studies in 3,631 people demonstrated that antibiotic-associated diarrhea was significantly more prevalent in those who were not supplementing with probiotics. In fact, nearly 18% of people in the control groups had antibiotic-associated diarrhea while only 8% of people in groups treated with probiotics were affected (6).The review concluded that probiotics — particularly Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii species— may reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by up to 51% (6).Traveler’s diarrheaTraveling exposes you to many types of microorganisms that are not typically introduced to your system, which can cause diarrhea. Traveler’s diarrhea is defined as “the passage of three or more unformed stools per day” with at least one related symptom, such as cramps or abdominal pain, occurring in a traveler after arrival to their destination. It impacts 20 million people annually (7, 8).A review of 11 studies found that preventative treatment with probiotic supplements significantly reduced the occurrence of traveler’s diarrhea (9).Another 2019 review of 12 studies showed that only treatment with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii resulted in significant reductions of up to 21% in traveler’s diarrhea (8).Diarrhea impacting children and infants Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and diseases that cause diarrhea are prevalent in infants and children.

There’s a time when there’s no way around the necessity to take antibiotics. They can save lives by eliminating bacteria, both bad or good. The good bacteria colonies living in your digestive tract get destroyed and can cause the microbiome to become imbalanced, as well as an array of unwelcome digestive problems. In as quickly as 48 hours after beginning a course of antibiotics, symptoms like stomach ache, nausea, bloating, and antibiotic-associated Diarrhea (AAD) can start.

Bottom Line
Antibiotic associated diarrhea can be a frustrating and potentially economically disadvantageous adverse effect from antibiotic administration in children, with a reported incidence of around 5% (Wistrom 2001). Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence, as theoretically their ingestion will reduce the disturbanceof normal gut flora, thereby decreasing the incidence of diarrhea (Roberfroid 2010.). We reviewed three trials and one systematic review on this topic, and found that the reviewed studies for the most part demonstrated a reduced incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with probiotics, compared to those treated with placebo (or plain yogurt). PGY-2: Fox et al found improvements in both stool frequency and consistency, as well as a reduction in other adverse events (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting).",Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence,neutral,"

Studies also suggest that probiotics may help relieve the diarrhea, gas, and cramping caused by antibiotics. A balanced microbiome may even support your child's immune system to help fight future infections, research suggests. Our gut microbiome plays a big part in how our immune system functions. In fact, our gut contains 70% of the immune system.There are hundreds of bacteria that are considered to be probiotics. A few of the most commonly used strains are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces.You may have also heard of prebiotics.",Studies also suggest that probiotics may help relieve the diarrhea,no,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/probiotics-may-offset-gut-damage-caused-by-antibiotics," Although the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are generally mild and self-limiting, severe cases are associated with discontinuation of antibiotic use and an increase in morbidity and mortality.In addition, evidence from animal studies also suggests that the disruption of gut microbiota composition due to antibiotics could have lasting effects, such as an increased risk of obesity and allergies.What are probiotics?Probiotics are live microorganisms, typically belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces, that produce beneficial health effects upon their oral intake. Studies have shown that the co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics can reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.Studies also suggest that probiotic microorganisms can suppress the growth of pathogenic or harmful bacteria, produce metabolites that alter gut microbiota composition, modulate the human immune system, and protect gut barrier integrity. However, clinicians have been hesitant about prescribing probiotics due to concerns that probiotics can alter the gut microbiome composition in the long term. In addition, studies examining the impact of probiotic coadministration on antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota composition have reported mixed results. To gain clarity on the impact of probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota composition, researchers at Texas Christian University recently conducted a systematic review to synthesize the results from these studies.Reviewing previous studiesThe current study included data from randomized clinical trials assessing the impact of antibiotics and probiotics in isolation or when prescribed together on fecal gut microbiota composition and gastrointestinal symptoms. The review included 22 studies involving either the use of antibiotics (n=11) or probiotics (n=11) alone and seven studies involving the use of probiotics in conjunction with antibiotics.",live microorganisms,neutral,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.rand.org/news/press/2012/05/08.html," Researchers from the RAND-based Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to find studies that examined whether probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Researchers pooled results from the studies together to gain a clearer understanding of whether probiotics can prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Use of probiotics was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of developing diarrhea when taking antibiotics as compared to not using probiotics. The RAND analysis estimates that 13 people would need to use probiotics in order to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, researchers say the evidence was insufficient to show which type of microorganism was better than another because the included strains were poorly documented and often given as blends of several types. Further, there was no indication that the response varied systematically by a person's age, the duration of antibiotic use or other clinical indications.",probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea,no,"

""We hope our study can help better inform doctors about how best to manage pain in this population,"" he said.Arthritis expert Dr. Bashir Zikria, an assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said there's been limited research comparing acetaminophen against a placebo.

Acetaminophen is not an anti-inflammatory, so it does not ease swelling. For this reason, Tylenol Arthritis is best for osteoarthritis and not inflammatory types of arthritis such as rheumatoid, reactive, or gout. Acetaminophen is thought to work by interfering with hormones called prostaglandins, reducing pain sensations within the nerve endings, nervous system, and brain. Tylenol Arthritis can temporarily relieve other types of pain such as general aches, muscle soreness, toothache, menstrual cramps, aches due to cold and flu, and back pain.

Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it? Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling.

You might think that listening to sad music when depressed would make someone feel worse, but studies have shown that people with depression prefer sad music, reporting that they find it soothing and uplifting.

What sets therapy apart from other musical endeavors is that it is typically led by a person with training in counseling, psychology or treating depression.Even though music therapy has long been used all over the world, research to date hasn’t offered a clear picture of its benefits, Gold said.The last review of music therapy published by Cochrane in 2008 didn’t offer as much evidence of benefits, Gold said. A milestone study that came out in 2011 concluded that music could help but was only done in one country and left many unanswered questions, he said.“The present review update confirms these findings and broadens them,” Gold said by email. “We still think that more research is needed; however, we feel that research on music therapy for depression can now turn to more specific questions, such as comparing different types of therapy to each other.”Studies included in the current review ranged in duration from six to 12 weeks. The smallest study had just 14 participants, and the largest one included 79 people.The total number of treatment sessions ranged from eight to 48, and the duration of sessions varied from 20 minutes to two hours.Only one of the studies in the analysis compared active versus passive music therapy, and it didn’t find a difference in the short-term severity of depression.“The most important finding is that music therapy shows short-term beneficial effects for people with depression when added on top of baseline psychological or pharmacological treatment,” said Dr. Gjin Ndrepepa, a researcher at Technical University in Munich, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study.How it works isn’t clear, Ndrepepa said by email.But modern brain imaging studies have shown that music therapy activates regions of the brain that are involved in regulating emotions.",music therapy in fact improves patients' symptoms and functioning,neutral,"

Another recent study conducted by researchers at Bournemouth University, explored the effects of music therapy in treating depression among children and adolescents. Results showed that those who received music therapy in addition to talk therapy had substantially improved self-esteem and significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to the children who received treatment without music therapy. Those in the music therapy cycle also showed improvement in communication, social function, and interactive skills.Psychiatrist Michael Crawford highlights several reasons that may explain why music therapy can be effective. He states that, ""first, it provides a sense of meaningfulness and pleasure—music is an aesthetic experience that draws in the otherwise passive patient; second, this kind of therapy engages the body and gets people moving—the physical participation averts depression; and finally, it is relational, in that music helps us engage, communicate, and interact with others.

What Is Music Therapy?6 Health Benefits of Music TherapyHow to Find a Reputable Music Therapist

It’s believed that music has been used since practically the beginning of time to help humans deal with difficult feelings and better connect to one another. Because of its strong and immediate influence over our emotions, coupled with its ability to naturally increase neurochemicals — including “feel good” endorphins — music is now being added to many rehabilitation programs across the world. Music therapy (MT), also commonly referred to as active music therapy or passive music therapy in many studies, has shown promise for improving both motor control and emotional functions in patients with a wide range of diseases or disabilities. From cases of schizophrenia to Parkinson’s disease, musical interventions seem to help naturally decrease symptoms like anxiety or depression, help ignite creativity, improve communications between patients and their caregivers, and much more.",musical interventions seem to help naturally decrease symptoms,neutral,"

How to Take Fish Oil for Borderline Personality Disorder Treatment
Most fish oil supplements contain a combination of EPA and DHA, which are the two major omega-3 fatty acids primarily responsible for fish oil’s health benefits. The most recent study used a concentrated fish oil containing both these fatty acids. In the 2003 Harvard study, however, the researchers used a concentrated form of EPA-only. There is no reason to believe that an EPA-only formulation is necessary, as long as a full 1200 mg of EPA plus DHA or a full 1000 mg of an EPA-only fish oil product is consumed daily.

However, the results of the current study extend these findings by suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe cases of borderline personality disorder.The main limitations of this study are that only women were studied and all subjects were moderately ill.

BPD is a serious mental condition. People with BPD struggle to regulate their emotions, their actions, and their relationships. They’re more prone to engage in unsafe sex or participate in unsafe or destructive activity. A borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis is more common in women than in males. Although anybody can acquire BPD, it is more likely in people who have a family history of the condition. People who suffer from other mental illnesses (such as anxiety, depression, or eating disorders) are more vulnerable.",more common in women,neutral,"

This prompted researchers to investigate whether increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish would have any effect on symptoms. The study, published in the January 2003 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, compared the effects of daily fish oil supplementation (one gram of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or E-EPA) in 20 adult women with moderate borderline personality with 10 women who were given a placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, women who took the supplements had significantly diminished aggression as well as a drop in the severity of depression compared with the placebo group. No adverse side effects were reported, which researcher Mary C. Zanarini, EdD, of the department of psychiatry at Harvard University in Boston, and colleagues, say is especially important. Taking prescribed medications is one of the biggest problems in treating mental disorders, but in this study 90% of both the fish-oil and placebo-treated groups complied and completed the study.",women who took the supplements had significantly diminished aggression,neutral,"

The omega-3s have also been proposed to alleviate or prevent other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit disorder. However, there is still not enough evidence to recommend the omega-3s in these conditions. What dose of omega-3s is beneficial? Doses for depression range from less than 1 g/day to 10 g/day, but most studies use doses between 1 and 2 g/day. In my practice, I recommend 1 to 2 g/day of an EPA+DHA combination, with at least 60% EPA, for major depression.",there is still not enough evidence,neutral,"

Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,https://visionsteen.com/new-study-omega-3-fatty-acids-and-borderline-personality-disorders-in-adolescents/," We’ve learned that applying Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), for example, has shown positive results in the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorders–recent studies have confirmed this, showing lower suicide rates, less self-harming incidents, and less self-removal from treatment. Psychiatry is still a relatively young science, and growth and change are happening quickly as practitioners eagerly seek resolution to some of the most challenging psychological issues. Dr. Ammiger’s discovery regarding the use of Omega-3 fatty acids is profound. The study, though small in scope, produced impressive results: the data “suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, at the right doses for a long-enough period of time, can significantly improve the quality of life for people with borderline personality disorder.”
 
More research around the use of Omega-3 fatty acids will need to be done to ultimately determine the long term efficacy of Omega-3 fatty acids, but Ammiger’s study has shone a light into what is a dark corner for many. _______________________________

The study looked at the effect of taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity. Three important results were reported from this new research:

People with asthma who took Vitamin D supplements as part of their asthma treatment plan were 50% less likely to go to the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital for asthma flares than those who did not take Vitamin D supplements. Taking Vitamin D was linked with needing less glucocorticosteroids following an asthma attack (either injection or tablet form). Patients whose Vitamin D levels were “low” at the beginning of the study experienced the greatest benefit from taking Vitamin D supplements. For these patients, their use of glucocorticosteroids with asthma flares decreased by more than half (55%).",taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity,neutral,"

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319617," Not only does the vitamin aid calcium absorption, which is vital for healthy bones, but it also helps to strengthen the immune system. It is the latter function that has led researchers to investigate vitamin D as a possible treatment for asthma.Respiratory infections, such as the common cold or the flu, are known to trigger symptoms of asthma – including airway inflammation, which can bring on an asthma attack.Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may help to lower the risk of respiratory infection-induced asthma attacks by boosting the immune system.To gain a better understanding of this association, Prof. Martineau and colleagues conducted a review of seven randomized controlled trials that looked at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on asthma severity.Asthma events, hospital visits reducedThe review included a total of 955 subjects with asthma, all of whom were receiving standard treatment for the condition.It was found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for asthma-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions by 50 percent when compared with a placebo, with the rate of such events falling from 6 percent to 3 percent.Also, among adults who did experience an asthma attack, vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections by 30 percent, from 0.43 events per person per year to 0.30 events per person per year.From a subgroup analysis, the researchers found that patients whose vitamin D levels were low at study baseline experienced the greatest benefit from vitamin D supplementation; their need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections fell by 55 percent.Still, they note that the small number of participants in each subgroup makes it difficult to confirm whether or not initial vitamin D levels influence the effect of supplementation on asthma severity.Further clinical trials underwayImportantly, it was also found that vitamin D supplementation was safe for participants at the doses used, and there were no differences in adverse effects between subjects who took vitamin D and those who took a placebo.Overall, the researchers believe that their findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation may be an effective way to help reduce asthma severity.“These results add to the ever growing body of evidence that vitamin D can support immune function as well as bone health.”Prof. Adrian Martineau“Vitamin D is safe to take and relatively inexpensive,” adds Prof. Martineau, “so supplementation represents a potentially cost-effective strategy to reduce this problem.”First study author Dr. David Joliffe, also of QMUL, notes that because the majority of study subjects were adults with mild to moderate asthma, they are currently unable to generalize the findings to children or individuals with more severe asthma.“Further clinical trials are ongoing internationally,” adds Dr. Joliffe, “and we hope to include data from them in a future analysis to determine whether the promise of today’s results is confirmed in an even larger and more diverse group of patients.”AsthmaRespiratoryEmergency MedicineImmune System / VaccinesShare this articleBy Honor Whiteman on October 4, 2017Latest newsFast food consumption may increase the risk of liver diseaseDeep meditation: Might it change the gut microbiome to boost health?Gut-brain connection: 3 fatty acids may be linked to tau-mediated damageStudy in humans confirms link between Parkinson's and gut bacteria imbalanceMultiple Sclerosis (MS): Stem cell treatment may prevent worsening of symptomsRelated CoverageWhat to know about seasonal asthmaMedically reviewed by Meredith Goodwin, MD, FAAFPSeasonal triggers and weather changes can exacerbate asthma symptoms, but medications and eliminating triggers can help.

Individuals who take an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to their standard asthma medication had a reduction in severe asthma attacks, according to a new review published in the Cochrane Library.There has been a link between low blood levels of vitamin D and the increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. This link has spurred a growing interest in the potential role vitamin D plays in asthma management, because it may help reduce upper respiratory infections that can lead to exacerbations of asthma, and several clinical trials have tested this theory.For the review, a team of Cochrane researchers examined 7 trials that involved 435 children, and 2 studies that involved 658 adults, who were ethnically diverse. A majority of patients recruited into these studies had mild-to-moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma.AdvertisementThe studies last between 6 and 12 months, and most of the patients continued to take their usual asthma medication while participating. After analyzing study data, the researchers found that giving patients an oral vitamin D supplement reduced the risk of severe asthma attacks that required hospital or emergency department admission from 6% to about 3%.Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma attacks that needed treatment with steroid tablets. These results were largely based on trials in adults.An additional finding showed that vitamin D did not improve lung function or day-to-day asthma symptoms, nor did it increase the risk of side effects at the doses that were tested.“We found that taking a vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma treatment significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma attack, without causing side effects,” said lead review author Adrian Martineau.",vitamin D did not improve lung function or day-to-day asthma symptoms,neutral,"

Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.”

High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults. The study participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting the broad range of global geographic settings, involving Canada, India, Japan, Poland, the UK, and the US.

Well it all depends; previous studies have not yet looked at what the benefit of taking vitamin D would have in those with asthma. Longer term research will be necessary to determine the appropriate role of this vitamin going forward although it appears that having a deficiency of vitamin D can possibly lead to worsening asthma.The level of vitamin can help in determining whether indeed you are getting an adequate amount from your diet and/or exposure to sunlight. The levels can vary depending on seasonal factors such as winter-spring vs. summer-fall, when levels are usually higher.

Use of soy formula to treat infant diarrhea has had mixed results, some studies showing improvement with soy formula while others show none at all. The most serious problem with soy formula is the presence of phytoestrogens or isoflavones. While many claims have been made about the health benefits of these estrogen-like compounds, animal studies indicate that they are powerful endocrine disrupters that alter growth patterns and cause sterility. Toxicologists estimate that an infant exclusively fed soy formula receives the estrogenic equivalent of at least five birth control pills per day.

When to Avoid Soy Formula  

Soy formula is not recommended unless a baby has a rare health condition or a family is strictly vegetarian or vegan. In addition, soy formula is not recommended for some specific situations. Avoid soy baby formula for:



Colic or fussiness, since the switch will likely not be helpful
A cow's milk protein allergy, because many infants who have a cow's milk allergy are also allergic to soy proteins and would benefit more from drinking an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula instead
A high risk for food allergies, since soy is among the most common allergens
Premature babies, since soy formula can lead to decreased bone mineralization, even when babies are given supplemental calcium



Unless there is a good reason to start your baby on soy formula, if you stop breastfeeding before your baby is 12 months old or need to supplement, it is best to start with a cow's milk-based formula rather than soy formula. Health and Hype of the Latest Baby Formula Trends


   A Word From Verywell

However, in the trials that continued for longer than four weeks, the average weight-loss was 0.8kg.Although these differences were statistically significant, the practical significance of such small amounts of weight-loss is questionable.The finding that the longer studies resulted in less weight loss was also discouraging. While many weight-loss supplements and diets result in initial success, long-term benefits are much more difficult to obtain yet are vital to long-term health.Some of the above trials also examined the impact of chitosan on serum cholesterol levels. The results were very similar to those with weight loss.A statistically significant reduction in cholesterol levels was found, but the benefits were much smaller in the high-quality trials and those that lasted longer.Problematic aspectsIn the controlled trials, participants taking chitosan reported similar adverse effects to those taking placebos. Concerns have been expressed that chitosan may bind fat-soluble vitamins resulting in lower intakes that might require vitamin supplementation.People with shellfish allergies should be cautious about chitosan, although such allergies are usually caused by components other than chitosan.Only high-quality supplements should be used to avoid concerns about trace contaminants from the shells.RecommendationsThere is some evidence that chitosan may help reduce the amount of fat absorbed into the body from the diet and so help to reduce weight.

(Reuters Health)—Water- or land-based exercise should provide some short-term benefit in pain management for hip osteoarthritis, though there are few well-designed trials testing it, according to a new review. You Might Also Like

“It is nice to finally have some hip-specific data, as hip and knee osteoarthritis are often grouped together, and it’s almost certain that there are differences between these groups of patients, as well as differences in those with multiple joint osteoarthritis,” says Dr. Amanda E. Nelson of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill, N.C., who was not part of the new study. ad goes here:advert-1ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE“However, the studies are still small and heterogeneous, and larger, longer-term studies of more specific interventions are certainly needed to provide more specific recommendations,” she says. The review only considered pain, not joint function, which may also improve with physical activity, Nelson told Reuters Health by email. ad goes here:advert-2ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUEThe researchers, led by Kay M. Crossley of La Trobe University in Bundoora, Australia, reviewed 19 studies of water-based or land-based exercise therapy or manual therapy for hip pain, 10 of which were designed specifically for hip osteoarthritis. Four studies found short-term benefits, up to three months later, with water-based exercise compared to minimal pain management.",minimal pain management,neutral,"

4 Strengthening Exercises for Hip Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common ailments affecting nearly 3 million people in the United States each year. It’s a chronic condition involving the bones and cartilage within a joint. OA is the breakdown of the cartilage within a joint that results in exposed bone. When this condition occurs, it causes bone on bone friction, resulting in pain, stiffness, loss of motion, decreased stability and/or the formation of bone spurs. Related: Arthritis – Not Just an Issue For The Elderly
The hip is a ball and socket joint that consists of the thigh bone (femur) and it’s articulation on the pelvis known as the acetabulum. The hip joint provides a high range of motion allowing the femur to move freely through a 360° circle.","

Always begin with stretching or other ROM exercises to prepare the body for strength and aerobic exercises.Respect pain: When the hip or other body parts feel painful, stopping for a while or adjusting the exercise to a more tolerable level can help.Physical therapists recommend people modify activities as necessary. Arthritis symptoms may come and go. A person should try to stay active and perform activities based on what feels tolerable at the moment.Home remediesAside from exercise, a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis.Alternative remedies are things people can introduce to their daily routine at home. These include:Hydration: Drinking enough water may help the body produce synovial fluid, keep joints lubricated, flush out toxins, and reduce inflammation.Assistive devices: Using aids such as reachers may help people avoid positions that cause pain. Walking supports can help improve mobility while distributing the weight outside of the body, reducing stress on the joint.Diet: Following a balanced diet can help a person maintain a moderate weight and reduce pressure on the hip joint.Heat and cold therapy: Applying hot and cold compresses may improve joint stiffness and swelling.",a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis,neutral,"

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://orthop.washington.edu/patient-care/articles/hip/osteoarthritis-of-the-hip-hip-arthritis.html," Stationary bike, swimming and water aerobics usually are well-tolerated and they are recommended. Work
Looking for a ""light duty"" alternative to heavy manual labor is one good approach for coping with osteoarthritis of the hip. Many patients who work at desks find that prolonged sitting in one position is associated with stiffness and pain upon first arising so periodically standing stretching or moving the hip through an arc of motion can be helpful at minimizing this “start-up” pain. Adaptive aids
For some patients, particularly those who cannot tolerate surgical interventions for medical or other personal reasons, use of a cane crutches or a walker can be of use. Additional Resources

The majority of osteoarthritis cases occur in the lower body. The aim of completing exercises is to strengthen the muscles surrounding your painful joints to help better support them and reduce the strain placed on them during day-to-day tasks. One of the best exercises anyone can complete at home, at the gym or your local community center are chair squats. This exercise engages your quadricep muscles (top of the thigh), gluteal muscles (your bottom muscles), hip stabilizers, and your abdominals helping to strengthen both the hip, knee and ankle joints.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/antioxidants-fertility_n_3697596," All told, the studies included in the review included more than 3,500 women who were attending fertility clinics.An earlier Cochrane review, on which Showell was also lead researcher, found that antioxidant use by male partners in couples undergoing fertility treatment was linked to higher birth rates, although the researchers cautioned that placebo-controlled studies would need to confirm the finding. The theory is that antioxidants help improve sperm quality by reducing oxidative stress, which could have a big impact, given that 30 percent to 80 percent of cases of male infertility are due to such sperm-related problems caused by oxidative stress.Resolve, the National Infertility Association, estimates that one-third of infertility cases are attributed to the female partner, one-third are attributed to the male and the remaining third are caused by some combination of both partners, or are simply unexplained. ""Oftentimes, patients latch on to something they heard made a difference for this person or that person,"" said Vitek, who said there may be some secondary gain from the placebo effect of taking antioxidant supplements. But in general, she counsels women who are undergoing fertility treatments to simply adopt as healthy a lifestyle as they can -- to exercise and eat well and attempt to manage their stress.Advertisement

Although the new findings on the limited benefits of antioxidants are not necessarily surprising, they are slightly disappointing, she said.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidant-supplements," Because free radicals can contribute to muscle fatigue and damage, it’s been proposed that taking antioxidant supplements can blunt their harmful effects, hence improving exercise performance and muscle recovery (7).However, several studies have shown that taking antioxidant supplements — specifically vitamins C and E — can interfere with how your body adapts to exercise and even eliminate some of the health benefits associated with exercise (8, 9, 10, 11).May Increase Cancer RiskThe oxidative stress caused by free radicals to the body’s cells is thought to be a major contributor to the development of cancer (12). Since antioxidants neutralize free radicals, taking antioxidant supplements have been speculated to decrease the risk of developing or dying from cancer (13).Several meta-analyses, however, have shown that taking antioxidant supplements does neither reduce the risk of many types of cancers nor reduce the risk of dying from them once diagnosed, In fact, they may even increase the risk of certain cancers (14, 15, 16, 17).In addition, several meta-analyses have found that beta-carotene supplements, a precursor of vitamin A, increases the risk of bladder cancer, and, in people who smoke, the risk of lung cancer as well (18, 19, 20, 21).The exception is selenium, which may help prevent cancer in people with low levels of the mineral or in people with an elevated risk of cancer. However, more research is needed before selenium can be recommended for this purpose (16, 22, 23, 24).May Cause Birth DefectsVitamin A is important for fetal growth and development, but at high doses, vitamin A supplements can increase the risk of birth defects (25, 26). Therefore, women who might be or are pregnant should not take high doses of vitamin A supplements (27).These supplements are only recommended for pregnant women in areas where vitamin A deficiency is prevalent, such as in Africa and Southeast Asia (28, 29). Beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, is not shown to lead to birth defects. But since taking the supplement long-term is associated with cancer, pregnant women should consult with their physician before taking beta-carotene supplements (30, 31).Summary While they’re thought to be healthy, taking antioxidant supplements may reduce the health benefits of exercise and increase the risk of certain cancers and birth defects.",increase the risk of certain cancers and birth defects,no,"

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/antioxidants-3561215/," The results from these high-quality studies have revealed that antioxidant supplements do not seem to have a beneficial effect on disease prevention. Below are some examples of these studies and their findings:

Across nine different randomized control trials testing various antioxidant supplements, results did not suggest that these supplements helped prevent cancer. In a trial testing vitamin E supplements among 40,000 middle-aged women, the results showed that supplementation did not decrease the risk of adverse health outcomes, including cancer, heart attack and stroke. In a trial of more than 8,000 middle-aged women with a high risk of developing heart disease, vitamin C, vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements did not lower the risk of diabetes, cancer or cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke). In a trial of more than 14,000 middle-aged men, vitamin E or C supplements did not reduce the risk of heart attack, heart disease death, stroke, cataracts or cancer. In a trial of more than 35,000 middle-aged men, vitamin E and selenium supplements did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer.",supplementation did not decrease the risk of adverse health outcomes,neutral,"

Antioxidants reduce the negative impact of free radicals, reducing cellular damage in the body. Often combined with vitamin E in research studies, vitamin C has been found to improve sperm health and decrease sperm DNA fragmentation. In one study of women undergoing IVF, vitamin C supplementation didn't improve measures of oxidative stress. But it did raise levels of vitamin C in follicular fluid, which could be associated with improved egg quality. Calcium

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110118101342.htm," New research by Dekel and her team, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), has revealed a possible unexpected side effect of antioxidants: They might cause fertility problems in females. advertisement








Common antioxidants include vitamins C and E. These work by eliminating molecules called reactive oxygen species that are produced naturally in the body. Stress can cause these chemically active molecules to be overproduced; in large amounts they damage cells indiscriminately. By neutralizing these potentially harmful substances, antioxidants may, theoretically, improve health and slow down the aging process. But when Dekel and her research team including her former and present Ph.D. students Dr. Ketty Shkolnik and Ari Tadmor applied antioxidants to the ovaries of female mice, the results were surprising: ovulation levels dropped precipitously. That is, very few eggs were released from the ovarian follicles to reach the site of fertilization, compared to those in untreated ovaries.",They might cause fertility problems in females,neutral,"

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.foxnews.com/health/antioxidants-may-improve-male-fertility," ""Oral supplementation with antioxidants may go some way to improve a couple's chance of conception,"" lead researcher Marian Showell of the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.To see if the research to date backs up that idea, Showell and her colleagues reviewed 34 studies that involved nearly 3,000 couples undergoing fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination — two of the most commonly used methods of boosting conception odds when sperm-related issues are involved. Each study investigated the potential role of one or more antioxidants.Based on 96 pregnancies among 964 couples in 15 of the studies, the researchers found that antioxidant use by the male partner increased the odds of conception four-fold.Further, men taking antioxidants improved the likelihood of their partners giving birth to a live baby by a factor of five, the researchers report in The Cochrane Library. Only three of the studies contained data on live births, however. ""The findings of increased live birth rates with antioxidants are based on a total of only 20 births — a relatively small number,"" Dr. Mark Sigman of Brown University, in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the review, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.Sigman, whose research found no improvement in semen quality with the antioxidant carnitine, was cautious about making too much of the review's results.The included studies did not use the same types or numbers of antioxidants, he added. As a result, the researchers could not determine the effectiveness of individual supplements.In addition to oral supplements, antioxidants can be found in a range of foods, from cranberries to collard greens, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.Both Sigman and Showell cautioned that couples should not count on antioxidants to overcome their fertility challenges. Even if certain supplements prove effective, further research is needed to determine which couples could reap the specific benefits.",Even if certain supplements prove effective,neutral,"

For example, vitamin E supplements may increase the risk of bleeding in people who are taking anticoagulant drugs (“blood thinners”). There is conflicting evidence on the effects of taking antioxidant supplements during cancer treatment; some studies suggest that this may be beneficial, but others suggest that it may be harmful. The National Cancer Institute recommends that people who are being treated for cancer talk with their health care provider before taking supplements.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258799/," In females, antioxidants are present in the ovary, follicles, follicular, tubal and peritoneal fluid, and endometrial epithelium [6], while in males, antioxidants are found in the testis, epididymis, secretions of the male accessory organs and seminal plasma [17].In an ART setting, antioxidants can be employed to ameliorate the harmful effects of excess ROS on gametes and embryos. Treatment strategies using antioxidants may be approached in two general modes, either as oral supplementation of the subfertile couple several months prior to their ART cycle, or as in vitro supplementation in media during the ART protocol itself, in order to minimize endogenous and exogenous sources of ROS, respectively. The role of antioxidants in assisted reproduction is indeed one of great importance. For example, in infertile men undergoing IVF and ICSI, high seminal ROS levels correlate negatively with spermatozoa morphology and vitality, and fertilization rates, while seminal antioxidant levels showed a positive correlation with fertilization rates. Although ROS levels were higher in IVF than in ICSI patient groups, total antioxidant concentration in seminal plasma and fertilization rates did not differ between the IVF and ICSI cohorts [9]. Seminal antioxidants, in general enhance spermatozoa quality leading to higher ART success rates.",Treatment strategies using antioxidants may be approached in two general modes,neutral,"

Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are essential to human life. Our bodies create some amino acids on their own, but others must be consumed through diet. Two amino acids commonly added to fertility supplements are L-arginine and L-carnitine. L-arginine might improve blood flow to the uterus and ovaries. However, a study published in 2010 found that higher levels of L-arginine in follicular fluid were associated with fewer embryos and egg retrieval numbers during IVF treatment.",antioxidants might have a positive effect on sperm health and egg quality,neutral,"

That said, the role of antioxidant supplementation on fertility is an important consideration which could drastically change the outcome when trying to conceive, especially as we age. There is an important balance between ROS and the antioxidants that control them, but over the age of about 35 to 38 years, we accumulate greater amounts of ROS which affects egg and sperm quality. This highlights the need for antioxidants to preserve reproductive function in those trying to conceive in their 30’s, 40’s and beyond. References

They found 28 such studies, representing more than 1700 subjects. Most of the studies were concerned with male infertility and sperm health.It’s encouraging that up to 75% of these studies found that supplementing with antioxidants improved fertility.In the above-mentioned studies, the most popular antioxidant supplements were vitamins C and E, as well as selenium and zinc. Supplementation with carnitine, coenzyme Q10 and glutathione reductase also produced positive results.Should infertile couples take supplements?In view of these positive findings, it would seem sensible for infertile couples (or at least the partner who has been identified as infertile) to use various supplements to improve the chance of pregnancy.However, until more clarity about the correct doses and combinations of supplements is obtained, it’s difficult to recommend that all infertile individuals should take nutrient supplements.There may also be risks associated with taking certain supplements.For example, high intakes of supplemental vitamin A are not recommended when you’re trying to fall pregnant because of the risk of damage to the baby. If this is the case, it’s safer to get vitamin A from a diet rich in beta-carotene, which is abundantly found in dark yellow and dark green fruits and vegetables.Food sources of antioxidantsAt this stage, it’s probably safer to follow a well-balanced diet that’s rich in protective antioxidants than to take vitamin and mineral supplements in large doses.The following foods are rich sources of the antioxidants that appear to improve fertility:a) Vitamin A or beta-caroteneLiver, eggs, fatty fish, carrots, butternut, sweet potato, broccoli, spinach, dark green lettuce leaves, spanspek, mangoes, pawpaw, orange juice, apricots and yellow peaches.b) Vitamin EWheat germ oil, sunflower, maize, olive and canola oils, almonds and avocado.c) Vitamin CCitrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, naartjies), guavas, berries (especially cranberries), spanspek, mangoes, pawpaw; tomatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, spinach, sweet peppers and chilli peppers.d) ZincOysters, wheat germ, lean meat, liver, poultry, Ricotta cheese, pecan nuts, peanuts and seafood.e) SeleniumBrazil nuts, fish and other seafood, wheat germ, molasses, sunflower seeds, eggs and milk.
