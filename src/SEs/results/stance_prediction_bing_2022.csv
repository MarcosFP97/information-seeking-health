As the crystal vibrations interact with the body’s natural energetic frequency, the body is said to be left feeling focused, relaxed, and clear. “Crystals absorb energy from pressure and movement and convert it into an electronic frequency,” says Polack. “It’s this frequency, unique to each type of crystal, that users are relying on when working with crystals, and given that many pain and anxiety relief devices work on similar principles, we do believe they can help in these areas.”Methods of treating pain and other disorders with electrical current include:radiofrequency ablation (RFA)electronic muscle stimulation (EMS)transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Compared to these therapies, any frequency a crystal might emit would be infinitesimal.

But despite the fact that crystal healing has seen an upsurge in popularity in recent years, this alternative treatment is not popular with most medical doctors and scientists, many of whom refer to crystal healing as a pseudoscience.

Furthermore, no scientific studies have shown that crystals and gems can be differentiated by chemical composition or color to treat a particular ailment. ""I am not aware of any [National Science Foundation]-supported studies into the healing powers of crystals,"" Peter Heaney, a mineral sciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, told the ""Washington Post (opens in new tab)"" in 2021.

Can collagen supplements cure osteoarthritis?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/collagen," What’s more, one review article concluded that taking oral collagen supplements reduced participants’ symptoms related to osteoarthritis, including stiffness (27).Collagen supplements may provide other health benefits as well, such as improving body composition in certain populations when combined with resistance training (28).It’s important to note that studies observed these beneficial effects of taking collagen mainly in older women with low bone mineral density.Therefore, collagen supplements may not have the same effects in other populations, such as men, those who are younger, or those who don’t have low bone mineral density.Do collagen supplements have side effects? Collagen supplements have a good safety profile and are not associated with adverse side effects. However, manufacturers often combine collagen with other ingredients in supplements. Certain ingredients could pose health risks, such as herbs and high levels of vitamins in supplements formulated to support the health of the skin, nails, and hair (29).For example, dietary supplement ingredients such as herbal extracts may interact with commonly prescribed medications, and some aren’t safe for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.What’s more, some supplements that contain collagen may also contain megadoses of nutrients like biotin, which could interfere with laboratory tests for heart and thyroid function.This and other vitamins and minerals could cause health issues if you take them in high doses for a long time (29).So, while supplements that contain only collagen are unlikely to cause any side effects, it’s important to read labels and understand the potential risks of supplements containing collagen combined with other ingredients.If you’re taking other medications or you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, make sure to speak with a healthcare professional before you start taking supplements.Collagen supplements vs. proteinIt’s important to note that you don’t need to eat collagen or take collagen supplements to support your body’s collagen levels or bone health.In fact, you can help your body make collagen and maintain healthy collagen levels and bone tissue by simply including enough high quality protein, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin C, and zinc in your diet (30, 31, 32).Eating a balanced diet with a bit more protein is especially helpful for maintaining muscle tissue and bone as you get older. Experts recommend consuming more than 0.36 grams of protein per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of your body weight for this purpose (30).To support this, combine this protein-rich diet with physical activity, especially resistance training and weight bearing exercise (30).SummaryCollagen supplements may help promote the health of the skin and skeletal system and may help improve symptoms related to osteoarthritis. They’re considered safe on their own but may contain other ingredients that aren’t appropriate for everyone.How to prevent collagen lossIt’s impossible to prevent all age-related collagen loss, but it is possible to slow down the process.As mentioned above, diet and other lifestyle factors can significantly affect your body’s collagen production.Smoking cigarettes and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol negatively affect collagen production, as does following a diet high in ultra-processed foods and added sugar (12, 13, 14).On the other hand, leading a healthy lifestyle by following a nutrient-dense diet and avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol use may help delay age-associated changes in collagen and reduce signs of aging such as wrinkles.Avoiding or reducing your intake of certain foods and beverages while increasing your consumption of others may help support collagen maintenance and overall skin health.For example, a diet low in compounds called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may help promote skin health.",are not associated with adverse side effects,neutral,"

May prevent bone lossYour bones are made mostly of collagen, which gives them structure and strength (11).Just as the collagen in your body deteriorates with age, so does bone mass. This may lead to conditions such as osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone density and a higher risk of bone fractures (12).Studies note that collagen supplements may help inhibit the bone breakdown that leads to osteoporosis (8).In a 12-month study, post-menopausal women took either a calcium and vitamin D supplement with 5 grams of collagen or a calcium and vitamin D supplement with no collagen daily. At the study’s end, those taking the calcium, vitamin D, and collagen supplement had significantly lower blood levels of proteins that promote bone breakdown than those who took only the calcium and vitamin D. The collagen group also had lower loss of bone mineral density (13).Another study found similar results in 66 post-menopausal women who took 5 grams of collagen daily for 12 months. Those who took the collagen exhibited an increase of up to 7% in their bone mineral density (BMD) compared with those who didn’t take collagen (14).BMD is a measure of the density of minerals, such as calcium, in your bones.",collagen supplements may help inhibit the bone breakdown that leads to osteoporosis,neutral,"

[5] Collagen comprises about 60% of cartilage, a very firm tissue that surrounds bones and cushions them from the shock of high-impact movements; so a breakdown in collagen could lead to a loss of cartilage and joint problems. However, potential conflicts of interest exist in this area because most if not all of the research on collagen supplements are funded or partially funded by related industries that could benefit from a positive study result, or one or more of the study authors have ties to those industries.

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet," Why has there been concern that cell phones may cause cancer? There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems: Cell phones emit radiation (in the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones would be of concern given how many people use them. Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health.

Their approach was to expose laboratory rodents to high doses of cell phone radiation over their entire life span and see if they developed cancer as a result. The study cost $20 million and took more than ten years to complete. Final results were released to the public in November 2018.

The Truth About Cell Phones and Cancerby Berkeley Scientificin 2018on Posted on March 19, 2018February 28, 2022


By Andrea He
Cell phones are now a constant fixture in our lives that we cannot live without. However, the ways that cell phone radiation could harm our bodies are still not solidified, but new evidence from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the recent announcement from the California Department of Public Health regarding the possible dangers of cell phones could start making us view our tech companions as something more malicious. The new NIH studies by the National Toxicology Program found that cell phone usage can actually be linked to certain types of cancer. In a multimillion dollar research study, 3,000 rodents were exposed to radiation levels similar to those allowed for current cell phone emissions and their health levels were tracked. (too spiecifcs) The rodents were split into two groups, one with lower radiation levels (highest level permitted for cell phones) and another one with higher radiation levels. They were monitored over a two-year period.",cell phone usage can actually be linked to certain types of cancer,yes,"

The epidemiological evidence for an association between RF radiation and cancer is found to be weak and inconsistent, the laboratory studies generally do not suggest that cell phone RF radiation has genotoxic or epigenetic activity, and a cell phone RF radiation-cancer connection is found to be physically implausible. Overall, the existing evidence for a causal relationship between RF radiation from cell phones and cancer is found to be weak to nonexistent. Similar articles

NTP scientists had exposed thousands of rats and mice (whose biological similarities to humans make them useful indicators of human health risks) to doses of radiation equivalent to an average mobile user’s lifetime exposure.The peer review scientists repeatedly upgraded the confidence levels the NTP’s scientists and staff had attached to the study, fuelling critics’ suspicions that the NTP’s leadership had tried to downplay the findings. Thus the peer review also found “some evidence” – one step below “clear evidence” – of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands.Not one major news organisation in the US or Europe reported this scientific news. But then, news coverage of mobile phone safety has long reflected the outlook of the wireless industry. For a quarter of a century now, the industry has been orchestrating a global PR campaign aimed at misleading not only journalists, but also consumers and policymakers about the actual science concerning mobile phone radiation. Indeed, big wireless has borrowed the very same strategy and tactics big tobacco and big oil pioneered to deceive the public about the risks of smoking and climate change, respectively.",radiation from mobile phones causes cancer,yes,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.acsh.org/news/2021/08/09/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer-15721," It is not like ionizing, high-energy radiation from X-rays, penetrating tissue more deeply and breaking DNA bonds. Despite the lack of a direct means of causing cell mutation, there has been a recurring concern about cellphones causing cancer – specifically those in the head and neck, the places we most commonly hold cellphones. If these wireless devices cause cancers, why have decades of studies demonstrated stable rates of brain tumors among adults and children while cellphone use has exploded exponentially? As you might expect, the answer is both complicated and uncertain. Dr. Geoffrey Kabat, a cancer epidemiologist, has written in the past that

The epidemiological evidence for an association between RF radiation and cancer is found to be weak and inconsistent, the laboratory studies generally do not suggest that cell phone RF radiation has genotoxic or epigenetic activity, and a cell phone RF radiation-cancer connection is found to be physically implausible. Overall, the existing evidence for a causal relationship between RF radiation from cell phones and cancer is found to be weak to nonexistent. Similar articles

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11577482/," However, the lack of ionizing radiation and the low energy level emitted from cell phones and absorbed by human tissues make it unlikely that these devices cause cancer. Moreover, several well-designed epidemiologic studies find no consistent association between cell phone use and brain cancer. It is impossible to prove that any product or exposure is absolutely safe, especially in the absence of very long-term follow-up. Accordingly, the following summary from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health offers advice to people concerned about their risk: If there is a risk from these products--and at this point we do not know that there is--it is probably very small. But if people are concerned about avoiding even potential risks, there are simple steps they can take to do so.

Mild headaches: Having a mild headache is considered a moderate reaction to a mosquito bite, normally appearing in those who have a weakened immune system. You can experience slight pain or tension, but it is not usually persistent and can be relieved used conventional painkillers or home solutions. If your headache intensifies or is prolonged, it might be a sign of a more serious illness and you should consult your doctor as soon as possible


Low fever: A mild or low fever is a symptom that can sometimes occur, normally when the immune system is struggling to fight off an invasive pathogen. You might find that your temperature is slightly, but not alarmingly, higher than usual. This symptom should begin to diminish within a few days but if it persists or worsens, you should speak to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a more serious, mosquito-borne illness.

Mosquito bites on their own aren’t a huge deal, but mosquitoes can pass on two potentially serious illnesses: West Nile Virus and Zika. “In the United States, we see more West Nile Virus than Zika,” says Nicholas E. Kman, MD, emergency medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “About 80 percent of people who are infected with West Nile Virus do not feel sick. For people who do, symptoms can include fever, headache, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph glands, and a rash on the chest, stomach, or back.” Symptoms usually last from a few days to a few weeks, according to Dr. Kman. “Some people can get serious infections like encephalitis (an infection of the brain),” he says. “With Zika, the CDC guidelines state that women should wait eight weeks, and men should wait six months after travel or symptomatic infection before attempting to conceive.”

Chiggers, redbugs, harvest mites -- whatever you call them, they are pesky little bugs whose bites cause really itchy rashes, usually around the ankles and waistline. advertisement








In addition to being uncomfortable and annoying, these bites may also cause a relatively rare allergic reaction to red meat known as alpha-gal, according to doctors at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Although the medical community has known for the past five to 10 years that ticks can cause this allergy, case studies from Wake Forest Baptist and the University of Virginia (U.Va.) suggest that chigger bites also may be responsible. The paper is published in the current issue of The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.","August 31, 2018

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics," But a genetic change that increases the risk of cancer can be passed down (inherited) if it is present in a parent's egg or sperm cells. For example, if a parent passes a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene to their child, the child will have a much higher risk of developing breast and several other cancers. That’s why cancer sometimes appears to run in families. Up to 10% of all cancers may be caused by inherited genetic changes. Inheriting a cancer-related genetic change doesn’t mean you will definitely get cancer.

So, is cancer genetic? In about 5% to 10% of cases, inherited genetic mutations are indeed at the root of increased cancer risk.﻿﻿﻿ These are known as hereditary cancer syndromes or germline mutations. Sometimes, cancer can appear to “run in your family” when in fact a lifestyle or environmental factor that's shared by family members may be the culprit, such as a smoking habit. Certain signs in your family’s medical history may indicate that you have inherited cancer risk. These include:



Cancer in many generations (like a grandmother, mother, and daughter)Multiple cases of the same type of cancer, especially if it is uncommon or rare Cancer at younger ages than usualChildhood cancer in siblingsMore than one type of cancer in a single personCancer in a pair of organs (such as both eyes, breasts, or kidneys)Cancer in the sex typically not affected (like male breast cancer)

Am I more at risk if my relatives have cancer? Some types of cancer can run in families. For example, your risks of developing certain types of breast cancer, bowel cancer or ovarian cancer are higher if you have close relatives who developed the condition.This doesn't mean you'll definitely get cancer if some of your close family members have it, but that you may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with other people.It's estimated that between 3 and 10 in every 100 cancers are associated with an inherited faulty gene.Cancers caused by inherited faulty genes are much less common than those caused by other factors, such as ageing, smoking, being overweight and not exercising regularly, or not eating a healthy, balanced diet. Most cancers develop as a result of a combination of risk factors, which in some cases can include family history.Some types of cancer are less likely to be genetic, such as cervical cancer and lung cancer.It's only likely that a cancer gene is present in a family if:there are 2 or more close relatives on the same side of the family (your mother's or your father's side) with the same type of cancer, or with particular types of cancer that are known to be linked – for example, breast and ovarian cancer or bowel and womb cancercancers are occurring at young ages (before the age of 50)a close relative has had 2 different types of cancer (rather than 1 cancer that has spread)You should contact your GP if some close family members have developed the types of cancer mentioned above and you're worried that you might develop cancer yourself. They'll ask about your family history, and if they think there's a chance you have an increased risk of developing cancer, they'll refer you to a genetic counsellor, family cancer clinic or a cancer specialist.Cancer Research UK has more information about family history and inherited cancer genes

Hereditary cancer is caused by an inherited genetic mutation. It is typical to see a recurring pattern of cancer across two to three generations—like multiple individuals diagnosed with the same type of cancer(s) and individuals diagnosed with cancer much younger than average. Familial cancer refers to cancer that appears to occur more frequently in families than is expected from chance alone.",Hereditary cancer is caused by an inherited genetic mutation,yes,"

Can cancer be inherited?,https://health.uconn.edu/medical-genetics/hereditary-cancer-program/what-is-hereditary-cancer/," Damaged cancer susceptibility genes can be inherited, and passed on, by men just as easily as women. If a parent carries a cancer susceptibility gene, each of their children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene, and thus the susceptibility to cancer. Each child also has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the working copy of the gene, in which case their cancer risk would be no higher than that of the general population. It should be noted that some cancer susceptibility genes only have links to cancers that may not be seen in both sexes, such as ovarian and prostate cancers. Parents of the unaffected sex can still carry and pass on these genes. Hereditary cancers generally are not significantly different from non-hereditary cancers.","can be inherited, and passed on, by men just as easily as women",neutral,"

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/genetics/family-cancer-syndromes.html," But cancer can sometimes be caused by an abnormal gene that is passed from generation to generation. Although these cancers are often referred to as inherited cancers, what is actually inherited is the abnormal gene that can lead to cancer, not the cancer itself. Only about 5% to 10% of all cancers are known to be strongly linked to gene defects (called mutations) inherited from a parent. To learn about the role of genes and how mutations can lead to cancer, see Genes and Cancer. How do you recognize an inherited or family cancer syndrome? Certain things make it more likely that cancers in a family are caused by a family cancer syndrome, such as:

Many cases of the same type of cancer (especially if it is an uncommon or rare type of cancer)
Cancers occurring at younger ages than usual (like colon cancer in a 20-year-old)
More than one type of cancer in a single person (like a woman with both breast and ovarian cancer)
Cancers occurring in both of a pair of organs (like both eyes, both kidneys, or both breasts)
More than one childhood cancer in siblings (like sarcoma in both a brother and a sister)
Cancer occurring in the sex not usually affected (like breast cancer in a man)
Cancer occurring in many generations (like in a grandfather, father, and son)

Most cancers are due to mutations that occur specifically within the group of the cells or the tissues that have cancer, and are not due to an inherited, genetic, germline susceptibility. The vast majority of cancer (about 90 percent) occur by chance

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-lung-cancer-genetic," They can also acquire genetic mutations later in life from exposure to toxins, chemicals, or other environmental factors.Inherited genetic changesSome genetic factors are inherited. Researchers know that DNA changes in a particular chromosome, such as chromosome 6, can influence a person’s lung cancer risk in various ways.Some people may inherit genes that make them less able to break down the cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco smoke. Others may inherit an inability to repair their DNA, making them particularly vulnerable to radiation and cancer-causing chemicals.Some cases of lung cancer occur due to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. EGFR helps cells grow, and a mutation that affects it can make the cells grow out of control, causing cancer.EGFR mutations are responsible for about 32% of non-small cell lung cancers worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80–85% of all lung cancers.Among never-smokers, this gene mutation is most common in females in East Asia.Acquired genetic changesAn individual usually acquires, rather than inherits, the genetic changes that cause lung cancer.People can get gene mutations from multiple sources. Exposure to certain environmental toxins can change how the cells grow, divide, and die.However, some genetic changes are not attributable to an external cause and happen randomly.Acquired gene changes can affect tumor suppressor genes.",changesSome genetic factors are inherited,neutral,"

Since then, there has been an abundance of research done that shows otherwise.A 2014 meta-analysis of 10 studies involving 1,266,327 children showed no relationship between autism and vaccinations. The same analysis also concluded that there is no connection between autism and:MMR: a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubellathimerosal: a vaccine preservative to prevent bacterial growth, used only in multidose vialsmercury: a naturally occurring metal found in thimerosalA Danish MMR vaccine study involving 6,517 autistic children included subgroups for autism risk factors.

The study proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and increasing rates of autism diagnoses in British children.Wakefield’s study included only 12 children, was poorly designed, and speculative in nature.

Are Vaccines Linked to Autism? The topic of childhood vaccines leading to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one that never seems to fades away. Concerns about vaccines leading to autism surfaced in 1999 and initially involved the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Because the MMR vaccine is usually given at age 12 to 15 months, and the first signs of autism often appear at this time, concerns were raised about a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted 9 studies that have found no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, or between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children.",The topic of childhood vaccines leading to autism spectrum disorder,yes,"

The doctor's claims have endangered children around the world and confused parents trying to make the right health choices for their children. To set the record straight, here's all the evidence that proves vaccines cause autism. In 1998, Wakefield wrote a paper claiming he had found a link between autism and gastrointestinal problems. The paper did not find a link between vaccines and autism, but in a subsequent press conference, Wakefield said he thought the MMR vaccines should be given individually, and not as a set.

Photograph: Keele UniversityIn 2017, the professor of bioinorganic chemistry published a paper on aluminium found in the brain tissue of five autistic patients that has been shared tens of thousands of times by vaccine skeptics online – despite criticism from health experts over its lack of controls and small sample size.The research was part-funded by a grant from the Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute, a US-based organisation that challenges vaccine safety.A Freedom of Information Act request by the Guardian has found that Exley received £22,173.88 in donations since October 2015 to help support his work, ranging from £2 to £5,000. More than £11,000 of contributions were made between January and April 2019. The majority of donations are less than £100.Exley told the Guardian: “[The money is used to] support basic running costs of my lab and are not associated with any specific project.",aluminium in vaccines is linked to autism,yes,"

Are vaccines linked to autism?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986133/," However, autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that has a strong genetic component with genesis before one year of age, when MMR vaccine is typically administered. Several epidemiologic studies have not found an association between MMR vaccination and autism, including a study that found that MMR vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism even among high-risk children whose older siblings had autism. Despite strong evidence of its safety, some parents are still hesitant to accept MMR vaccination of their children. Decreasing acceptance of MMR vaccination has led to outbreaks or resurgence of measles. Health-care providers have a vital role in maintaining confidence in vaccination and preventing suffering, disability, and death from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

Sodium Bicarbonate and Cancer 






















Over two decades ago, an oncologist based in Rome named Dr. Tullio Simoncini proposed the idea that cancer is a fungus and that sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda (one of the most powerful anti-fungal substances) can effectively treat cancer. Simoncini presented his idea with supporting documentation to the Italian Department of Health. His theory was ignored, and Dr. Simoncini was scorned as a doctor for having such an abstract idea and using an unproven treatment on his patients. Dr. Simoncini strongly believed,  and his patients were proof, that sodium bicarbonate treatments worked. With minimal side effects and very low risk, this treatment was quick, effective, and has worked for people with many different types of cancer.",Sodium Bicarbonate,neutral,"

Using baking soda to increase the pH levels of the body is always beneficial if the body is an acidic state. Contrary to popular opinion, baking soda does not contain aluminum but baking powder which is a different product may contain aluminum.

Whether you’re setting records in the gym or going for a run, you’ve likely experienced knee pain. In fact, chronic knee pain affects about 25% of adults, according to the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. It’s one of the most common sports– and workout-related injuries there is, and that pesky pain can hinder even the toughest athlete from getting reps in on the squat rack. “Most commonly, the knee pain people refer to in the gym has to do with the anterior (front) part of the knee,” says David Otey, C.S.C.S., a personal training manager at Equinox. “Proper form in squatting is crucial for this.",If your knees hurt,neutral,"

Are squats bad for knees?,https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/managing-pain/joint-protection/how-to-squat-correctly," Squatting is a functional move. It helps you do activities in your daily life, such as getting pots out of a bottom cabinet or picking up shoes off the floor. Squatting also helps build strength in the legs and hips, and stronger muscles mean more stable joints. But if you don’t squat correctly, it can be painful to sore knees. Too many people compensate for sore knees by bending over at the waist, which can lead to a sore back, says Cynthia Harrell, physical therapist and clinical coordinator of the arthritis and osteoporosis programs at the Duke Center for Living at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

Why are Squats Bad for the Knees? Generally, squats are not in fact significantly detrimental to the physical integrity and function of the knees in most healthy individuals - save for the unfortunate situation of the exerciser performing said squats exercise with improper form or excessive amounts of weight beyond their physical strength capacity. This is not to say that even just the unweighted movement of the squat will not place some form of pressure on the knees, however, as the bodyweight as well as any additional load is distributed evenly throughout the patellar plate and surrounding tissues, though generally not to any injurious extent in ordinary circumstances. A distinctly common rumor found in many fitness and training circles is that the particular depth of the squat is directly proportional to the risk of knee injury, with the logic behind such a belief being that squats of lower elevation place more of the resistance on the knees as the exerciser’s positioning shifts their bodyweight parallel to the patellar joint. Save for the use of improper form or the exerciser squatting on an uneven platform, there is no clinical evidence to suggest such a belief is true, and certain research articles have even detailed the opposite being true - with squats of low range of motion presenting the same tension on the knees as those of a deeper elevation.

Are squats bad for knees?,https://www.healthline.com/health/knee-arthritis-exercises-to-avoid," As long as you’re able to practice with minimal knee joint discomfort, it’s safe to include squats in your exercise routine.People with arthritis may find the most benefit in wall squats, since squatting against the wall can help reduce your risk of putting unnecessary or incorrect pressure on your knees.To do a basic squat:Stand with your back against a wall. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your heels about 18 inches away from wall.Keep your knees in line with your heels, not out in front of your toes.Breathe in and exhale as you sit down or “squat.” Your buttocks shouldn’t drop any lower than knee level.Keep your abdominal muscles tight and ensure that your back is pressed flat against the wall.Push up through your heels — not the balls of your feet — and inhale as you stand up.“Keep the knee over the ankle and not over the ball of the foot,” Bell cautions.“If you begin to experience intense pain at any point — more than your typical knee pain — you should stop the practice for the day. “Be sure to give the move another try during your next practice. You’ll find that your pain threshold increases as you build up muscle strength.”How to practice deep lungingFor people with knee osteoarthritis, lunging poses the same benefits and risks as deep squatting. Lunges are a great way to improve your overall leg and hip strength, but they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly.The trick, Bell says, is to make sure your knee doesn’t extend past your ankle.You may also find it helpful to practice lunges while holding on to the back of a chair or table for added support.To do a basic lunge:Grab on to your support, if needed.Step forward with one leg.",they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly,neutral,"

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://rexmd.com/learn/does-lisinopril-cause-erectile-dysfunction," The researchers attribute the initial decline in sexual interaction to the psychological effects of hypertension diagnosis and first treatment, and conclude that the ""low incidence of sexual dysfunction with ACE inhibitors [is] probably due to the fact that these drugs work through channels other than the sympathetic nervous system in lowering [blood pressure]."" What Does Cause Erectile Dysfunction? While it seems that the connection between lisinopril, ACE inhibitors, and erectile dysfunction is slim at best, there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction. In general, conditions that negatively impact the strength of blood flow or volume will have a negative impact on erections. The most common physical issues that are connected to erectile dysfunction are high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Other medications for high blood pressure, including alpha-blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), also rarely contribute to ED.Is it Safe to Use ED Medication with Lisinopril?Currently, the most effective treatments for erectile dysfunction are PDE5 inhibitor medications, such as sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), vardenafil (Levitra®) and avanafil (Stendra®).These medications work by increasing the rate of blood flow to the erectile tissue of your penis, making it easier to get and maintain an erection when you’re sexually aroused. Because PDE5 inhibitors and anti-hypertensive medications both improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, there’s a risk of interactions when ED medications are used with some common medications for high blood pressure. For example, many medications for ED can interact with organic nitrates and nitrites, as well as alpha-blockers used to treat high blood pressure and/or heart failure. Our guide to Viagra and nitrates provides more information on these interactions and their often severe health risks.Research suggests that ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, on the other hand, do not increase the risk of side effects with ED medications such as sildenafil.If you currently use lisinopril or other medication to control your blood pressure, it’s important to inform your healthcare provider about this before using any ED medications.How to Maintain Healthy ErectionsIf you’re prescribed lisinopril or similar medication to treat high blood pressure, there are several things that you can do to improve your erections and sexual health naturally:Keep active.",erectile dysfunction is rarely a side effect of ACE inhibitors,no,"

The 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors result in a drop in median serum dihydrotestosterone levels by 60%-93% within 2 years, but there is no major change in testosterone levels. In this review, we surveyed studies on erectile dysfunction in patients treated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and critically examined the evidence that associates 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and erectile dysfunction. We conclude that 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors do not lead to erectile dysfunction to a significant degree, and we support the position that dihydrotestosterone is less relevant than testosterone in erectile function.

Morphine may become the main way a person is able to feel pleasure; thus, a dependence may form. From Abuse and Dependence to Addiction
Not everyone who develops a dependence on morphine may become addicted to it, but it is highly likely. When someone uses a drug for recreational purposes (i.e., beyond the scope of a legitimate prescription), the risk for becoming addicted to the drug increases. Injecting, snorting, or smoking morphine sends the drug rapidly across the barrier between the brain and blood, and circumvents any extended-release properties, sending the entire dosage into the bloodstream at once. Not only does this raise the risk for a potentially fatal overdose from suppressed respiration rates, it also may lead more quickly to dependence and addiction.",it is highly likely,neutral,"

Fructose from whole fruit doesn’t add to your intake of free (or added) sugar, but in fruit juice or a smoothie it does.What is free (added) sugar?Free (added) sugar includes the sugars added to foods by manufacturers, eg in cakes, chocolates, jam, some pasta sauces, fizzy drinks and breakfast cereals. It also includes the sugar found in fruit juices, smoothies and honey.A recent report by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), stated that we need to reduce our intake of free (added) sugars by half.The report recommends that we should consume no more than 5 per cent of our energy from free sugar. This means the maximum daily intake of free (added) sugar should be:19g, equal to 5 cubes or 5 tsp of sugar, for children (aged 4 to 7)24g, equal to 6 cubes or 6 tsp of sugar, for children aged (7 to 10)30g, equal to 7 cubes or 7 tsp of sugar, for children (over 11) and adultsEating too much free (added) sugar contributes towards obesity, tooth decay and also puts people at risk of Type 2 diabetes. The report clearly states that we do not need to cut down our intake of whole fruit and, in fact, recommends that we eat more.The best thing you can do is to get label savvy, so that you are aware of all the hidden free (added) sugars in the foods that you buy.",Type 2 diabetes,neutral,"

                  Drinking diet drinks and fruit juice can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a new study has found. Research has found that people who guzzle drink diet drinks, such as Diet Coke, were 18 per cent more likely to develop the condition. And the shocking results found that drinking just three-and-a-half extra glasses of orange juice a week can raise the risk by 15 per cent. Research from Harvard University has found that people who guzzle drink diet drinks, such as Diet Coke, (pictured) were 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (file image) However those who who opt for tea, coffee and water can see their likelihood decrease by ten per cent.

Fruit juice is particularly high in sugar. Drinking no more than 1 cup of fruit juice per day can help keep sugar intake within healthful limits.Many processed or baked foods, such as biscuits and ketchup, contain added sugar. Eating less of these foods can help a person reduce their calorie and sugar intakes.People with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are high, but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Having prediabetes does not mean that a person will definitely develop diabetes, but it does increase the risk.By lowering their blood glucose levels, a person with prediabetes may be able to prevent it from developing into type 2 diabetes.

The rapid delivery of a large sugar load, without many other components that are a part of whole fruits, may be an important mechanism by which fruit juices could contribute to the development of diabetes. Fructose consumption has also been implicated in the development of many manifestations of the insulin resistance syndrome (25,26). Frequent consumption of fruit juices may contribute to a higher dietary glycemic load, which has been positively associated with diabetes in this cohort (27). Fruit and green leafy vegetables may contribute to a decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes through their low energy density, low glycemic load, and high fiber and micronutrient content (28). In particular, green leafy vegetables may supply magnesium, which has been inversely linked to the development of type 2 diabetes in women (8).",fruit juices could contribute to the development of diabetes,yes,"

Key Highlights


Naturally sweet drinks, including 100% fruit juices, and artificially sweetened beverages such as ‘diet’ soft drinks may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes




The study provides further evidence demonstrating the health benefits associated with decreasing sugary beverage consumption and replacing these drinks with healthier alternatives




Here’s a list of healthy beverages people with diabetes can choose from



New Delhi: You probably know that sugar-sweetened drinks aren’t healthful, especially for people with diabetes as they can cause blood sugar levels to spike suddenly. But are naturally sweet drinks and 100% fruit juices that contain no added sugar any healthier? According to a new study published in the journal Diabetes Care, that sugar content found in naturally sweet drinks may not be as healthy as you think. The researchers from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health said that naturally sweet drinks and artificially-sweetened beverages such as ‘diet’ soft drinks may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Instead, the researchers suggested replacing sugary drinks of any kind with non-sweetened beverages such as water, tea, and coffee to reduce the risk.",raise blood sugar levels,neutral,"

      Our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk.

The evidence for an association of intake of fruit juices with health outcomes is much less abundant and consistent. Results from a 2013 prospective cohort study5 that included 187 382 participants who were observed for up to 24 years (dietary intake information was updated every 4 years) showed that greater whole-fruit consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juices was associated with a higher type 2 diabetes risk.5 In a 2015 meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies,6 each additional daily serving of SSBs was associated with 13% (95% CI, 6%-21%) greater risk of diabetes, while each additional daily serving of fruit juices was associated with 7% (95% CI, 1%-14%) greater risk. There is some evidence that moderate consumption of fruit juices is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease, especially stroke, and cognitive decline.7,8 Findings from the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands study7 showed that moderate consumption of 100% fruit juice (≤7 five-oz glasses per week) was associated with 17% (95% CI, 5%-27%) lower risk of cardiovascular disease and 24% (95% CI, 6%-39%) lower risk of stroke. In a 2019 study,8 compared with less than 1 serving per month, daily consumption of orange juice was associated with substantially lower odds of poor subjective cognitive function among men middle-aged and older (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67). The potential underlying mechanisms for the observed inverse associations may be related to the high antioxidant and bioactive substance (including vitamins, minerals, and polyphenols) content in some 100% fruit juices. These nutrients are hypothesized to reduce oxidative stress and improve inflammatory markers, endothelial function, and cognitive performance.7,8 However, the question is whether polyphenols and other phytochemicals in fruit juices can counteract the effects of sugars on weight and type 2 diabetes.",greater consumption of fruit juices was associated with a higher type 2 diabetes risk,yes,"

It is estimated that one in three people will suffer with arthritis at some point in their lives and the use of magnetic bracelets and magnetic therapy plays a positive role in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of arthritis. Magnetic therapy is a natural way to treat arthritis in both humans and animals. Small high strength magnets are used on the body by the main arteries or as close to the point of pain as possible. Static magnets penetrate through the skin and deep into the tissues and blood stream, the damaged cells around the inflammation react to the magnetic field by realigning their ions into the correct position and start the process of removing the excess fluid from within the cell.

Do magnetic wrist straps help with arthritis?,https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/nordic-walking," While there’s no cure for arthritis, exercise may help reduce pain symptoms (19, 20).Nordic walking is a low impact exercise that produces less load on the joints and increases muscle strength, which may help reduce arthritis pain (15, 21).In fact, low intensity and low impact exercise may be just as good of an option for those with arthritis. One study showed that this type of exercise was as effective as high intensity exercise at reducing arthritis pain (22).Another study found that Nordic walking increases hip range of motion, stride length, and functional fitness in those with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, it was shown to significantly reduce perceived pain compared with home-based exercises (23).While arthritis pain may require multiple interventions (e.g., medication and physical therapy), incorporating Nordic walking is a cost-effective, low impact exercise that may help alleviate arthritis pain.SummaryNordic walking is a low impact cardio and strength-building exercise that may help alleviate arthritis pain.Are there any risks to Nordic walking?For most people, Nordic walking is a safe and effective form of exercise.That said, if you have any injuries or have been advised to avoid certain forms of exercise, you should speak with your healthcare professional first.What’s more, it may take time to get used to walking with Nordic poles. Therefore, it’s best to try Nordic walking on flat terrain before moving on to uneven terrain or hills.Finally, practicing proper technique will ensure you’re using the poles correctly and activating the right muscle groups.SummaryUnless your healthcare professional advises against it, Nordic walking is safe for most people.What equipment do you need for Nordic walking?Beyond wearing proper walking shoes, all you need for Nordic walking are Nordic walking poles.You’ll want to make sure that you’re purchasing proper Nordic walking poles, since they’re specially designed for the unique walking and hand-grip techniques used in Nordic walking.The poles are lightweight (around 0.5 pounds, or 0.23 kg) and have a small grip with removable hand straps. These straps help position your hands properly and keep the poles from falling.With Nordic walking, your hands are not fully gripped around the pole and left mostly open. As you walk, you hold the poles behind your body — almost as if you’re dragging them behind you.",Nordic walking poles,neutral,"

Do magnetic wrist straps help with arthritis?,https://melissajanelee.com/the-benefits-of-wearing-a-magnetic-bracelet/," Do magnetic bracelets help with pain and other ailments? Many healthcare professionals say there is no such thing as a pain relief bracelet, and that wearing magnetic bracelets for arthritis, for example, has no proven medical basis. However, lots of people continue to swear by the benefits of magnetic bracelets and wear them daily. Some of the conditions that are reported to improve with the use of magnetic bracelets include:

migraine headaches
repetitive strain injury
carpal tunnel syndrome
rheumatoid arthritis
other arthritis pain
high blood pressure
high levels of stress
joint pain
problems with blood circulation and blood flow

Although the proponents of magnetic therapy, including the Magnetic Therapy Council, claim that ""there are no known side effects to using medical magnetic treatments,"" many users still report some minor side effects that have come about from the usage of these magnetic bracelets and necklaces. Some of these minor side effects include a warm or hot feeling for the first few days in the areas where the magnets have been placed, according to the Magnetic Therapy Council (MTC).

Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160418-the-surprising-downsides-of-sit-ups," Researchers are not only arguing over whether sit-ups do you any good – but whether they might even be bad for you. Do they give you a taut six-pack across your abdomen or does a flat stomach depend more on diet and general exercise than a specific routine? A review of all the research conducted on sit-ups reports evidence that they do improve flexibility and muscle strength and that in dogs flexing the spine has been shown to help the delivery of nutrients to the discs which could prevent stiffness.So far, so good. But to get the desired six-pack does take an awful lot of work. In a small randomised controlled trial in Illinois in 2011 one group did daily abdominal exercises while the lucky control group did none. After six weeks detailed measurements were taken and it was found that the sit-ups made no difference to waist size or the amount of fat around their stomachs.Some people may be genetically predisposed to suffer back pain from sit-ups (Credit: Getty Images)Many sportspeople do sit-ups as part of a raft of exercises which aim to improve their core stability, but research from Thomas Nesser from Indiana State University suggests that improving your core stability doesn’t necessarily result in better athletic performance.Whether or not they provide you with precisely the physique or fitness you desire, could sit-ups bring unintended consequences such as back pain?",whether they might even be bad for you,neutral,"

no.
"
Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/want-a-stronger-core-skip-the-sit-ups," One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back - they push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort. Second, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles. Finally, activities of daily living, as well as sports and recreational activities, call on your muscles to work together, not in isolation. Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups. Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout like plank exercises helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.",hard on your back,neutral,"

From celebrity trainers working in the trendiest Manhattan gyms to the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis and the US Army training exams, sit-ups are developing a bad reputation. Scientists have discovered that the moves, once a staple of basic workout routines, don't reduce waistline circumference or trim belly fat. Sit-ups are also not the best way to strengthen your core or to keep it flexible and strong for the long run.Last week, the US Army announced that after decades of requiring two-minute sit-up tests, it would phase out that portion of its fitness test by the end of 2020. Instead, the Army says it'll make room for some fitness tasks found to be more useful for soldiers' combat readiness, like deadlifts, power throws, and drag-and-carry moves, The Washington Times reported.It's a change that Tony Maloney, a trainer and exercise physiologist at the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, can get behind.

When it comes to working out, there are a lot of different opinions on what is best for different areas of the body. However, when it comes to the abs, there is one type of workout that is often thought of as being bad for the area – and that is the sit-up. Sit-ups can actually put a lot of strain on the lower back and the sciatic nerve, which can lead to sciatica. You can use exercises to alleviate sciatic pain to make it go away. Any dysfunction in the spine is caused by a dysfunction in the core. There are numerous ways to strengthen the core, including core stabilization and dead-bug exercises.","November 13, 2022",no,"

One such motion that was once considered healthy, but could cause a ruptured disc, is the sit-up. Are Sit-Ups Bad for You? According to the Daily Mail, the US Army revamped the physical fitness test to exclude sit-ups, which military advisers and personal trainers deemed as “dangerous because they put too much pressure on the spine.” The article also reports that a study showed 56 percent of all injuries endured during the old fitness test were because of the sit-ups.

Forcing a left-handed child to use right hand can cause many adverse effects

By Penwise (self media writer) | 1 year ago














Due to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. It is common in different part of the world. Asia is even noted as a place where people practice this act a lot. Nigeria is not left behind, as this act is commonly seen here. But do you know that, the act of forcing a child who is left handed to change to right handed, can cause adverse effect on the child? Well, it is important for you to know that changing the hand a child uses when writing, can cause great confusion in the brain and can have a lot of adverse effects on the child

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22332811/," The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand.

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/slurred-speech-anxiety," When people develop slurred speech, such as after a stroke, it’s usually due to the development of dysarthria.In some people, anxiety can lead to symptoms that mimic those found in motor speech disorders, such as slurred speech. However, slurred speech that’s caused by anxiety isn’t the same as slurred speech caused by dysarthria. In fact, it’s rare for anxiety to cause slurred speech at all.“In speech therapy, I have seen short-term memory deficits and difficulty with concentration with anxiety, as well as accelerated rate of speech,” said Jennifer Daniels, MA, CCC-SLP, a speech language pathologist in Columbus, Ohio. “But not slurred speech, per se.”So, in what ways could anxiety potentially lead to slurred speech? As it turns out, anxiety can have a negative impact on both the cognitive element of producing speech, as well as the physical act of speaking.When you become anxious, increased tension in the muscles of the jaw or face can have an impact on your speech.“Muscle tension can cause speech to sound different, as you are not able to manipulate sounds in the same way as normal,” explained Daniels. “Your pharynx and oral cavity have to move in certain ways for sounds to resonate properly.”An increase in muscle tension may make it more difficult for the mouth and tongue to produce words in a clear, concise manner.",it’s rare for anxiety to cause slurred speech at all,neutral,"

Remembering letters quite slowly
Confusing similar letters (L-M, P-T-H, S-C, etc.) Do not recognise letters in an inverted form, i.e. shaded, crossed out, without one of its elements
Sometimes reading right to left or from the middle of the page, jumping through the lines
Difficulty combining single letters into words
Spending the majority of time on reading during reading technique tests due to their slow reading pace
Not understanding what has been read if there are variations in the correlation of a word, even though the reading technique has been mastered

Our findings provide evidence for persisting differences in the functional neuroanatomy of handwriting between right-handers and converted left-handers, despite decades of right-hand writing. Right-hemispheric activation in converted left-handers may reflect suppression of unwanted left-hand movements. Alternatively, this activity may represent persistent left-handedness and, as such, demonstrate a hemispheric asymmetry of hand movement representations in cortical motor association areas in relation to the direction and degree of handedness.

Concerning right-handers there are observations of ‘crossed aphasia’ caused by right brain damage in right-handed patients (Alexander and Annett, 1996; Coppens et al., 2002; Bartha et al., 2004; Marien et al., 2004). In these patients, the right hemisphere is dominant for language although it does not control the dominant hand. The frequency of dissociations between the laterality of dominant hand control and of language increases when left-handed persons are considered. Indeed the majority of left-handed patients with aphasia have left hemisphere lesions, although their dominant hand is controlled by the right hemisphere. The number of patients with aphasia after right brain damage is, however, substantially higher than in right-handers, and there are indications that the brains of left-handers differ from those of right-handers also by an increased incidence of bilateral representation of language (Gloning, 1977; Hécaen et al., 1981; Kimura, 1983; Annett and Alexander, 1996; Knecht et al., 2000).Dissociations between control of the dominant hand and dominance for speech offer the opportunity to decide empirically which of them determines the laterality of apraxia.",crossed aphasia’ caused by right brain damage,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/7/2816," Until some decades ago, innately left-handed children who attended German schools were often forced to use their right hand for writing. Because of life-long practice, these converted left-handers became as proficient at right-hand writing as innate right-handers. Yet most of these converted left-handers continued to use their left hand for other manual skills, which were less subject to social control. Indeed, attempts to switch handedness usually failed to establish a consistent preference for the right hand in innately left-handed subjects (Porac and Buller, 1990). Such considerations raise the question of whether converted left-handers use the same brain areas as innate right-handers for the selection and execution of handwriting and how much (covert) left-handedness might persist during right-hand writing in converted left-handers.To address this issue, we investigated the functional neuroanatomy of right-hand writing in converted left-handers and innate right-handers. Because most converted left-handers still demonstrate overt left-handedness during manual skills other than handwriting (Porac and Buller, 1990), we postulated that the functional neuroanatomy of right-hand writing in converted left-handers would differ from innately right-handers, showing persisting features of covert left-handedness.",attempts to switch handedness,neutral,"

We argue that a forced switch of handedness represents an early and persistent environmental modulator of maturation of the basal ganglia, which itself is genetically determined and only complete in the third decade of life (Steen et al., 1997; Sowell et al., 1999; Snook et al., 2005). Morphometric studies in children aged 7–16 have described a substantial loss of striatal and pallidal volume during normal development (Sowell et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2000), likely because of pruning processes. Studies in genetically caused disorders found a relative size increase of these structures compared with controls (Binkofski et al., 2007; Gothelf et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning in the territory of the putamen that integrates executive and cognitive aspects of motor control. In converted left-handers, individual variations in the volume of the left midputamen correlate with the acquired dexterity of handwriting.",environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning,neutral,"

After administration of the low vitamin E-containing oil there was a considerably smaller reduction of serum triglycerides and no significant reduction of fibrinogen. Both oils caused an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in the atherogenic index, but neither oil altered the total cholesterol level. Serum vitamin E was decreased by 9% and plasma malondialdehyde was increased by 122% after intake of the low vitamin E-containing oil, but both remained normal after intake of the other oil. The effect of vitamin E may be due to inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation with less formation of malondialdehyde and a larger amount of active (n-3) fatty acids in their sites of action in the liver, resulting in a greater decrease in the synthesis of triglycerides and fibrinogen.

In countries where people eat more oily fish, such as in the Mediterranean, Greenland and Japan, fewer people have heart disease compared to countries where people eat very little oily fish, such as the UK. The Omega 3 fats EPA and DHA can help protect the heart and blood vessels from disease: They can help:

lower triglycerides (a fat that enters your blood after a meal)
improve circulation (blood flow around the body)
prevent blood clots
lower blood pressure
keep the rhythm of your heart steady. Higher levels of the Omega 3 fats EPA and DHA in the blood have also been linked with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. There is still research on-going, but doctors think that the benefits come from eating foods that contain omega 3s rather than over-the-counter supplements. However, some high-dose Omega 3 supplements may be prescribed by your doctor to treat hypertriglyceridaemia.",triglycerides,neutral,"

Omega-3 supplements from fish oil appear to be heart-healthy and have a protective effect on CHD. But before we all start reaching for supplements, it may be worth following a heart-healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables, with lean protein such as fish, as recommended by the AHA. For those of us at highest risk, especially those with elevated triglyceride levels, it is worth speaking with your physician about high dose EPA fish oil supplements. Share This Page

Can fish oil improve your cholesterol?,https://newhealthcorp.com/should-you-take-fish-oil-for-cholesterol/," There is no evidence that fish oil is good for lowering high cholesterol levels. In fact, some studies show that fish oil can elevate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol. The relationship between diet, cholesterol, and disease is complex. While fish oil may benefit heart health for some people, a person with high LDL cholesterol may need to opt for other forms of omega-3. In this article, we will look more closely at whether people should take fish oil for cholesterol, other ways to benefit from omega-3, and other approaches to lowering cholesterol.

Research Report


Cannabis (Marijuana) Research Report
Is marijuana addictive? Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. Recent data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of marijuana use disorder.18 People who begin using marijuana before the age of 18 are four to seven times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder than adults.19
Marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence—in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. People who use marijuana frequently often report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness, and/or various forms of physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to 2 weeks.20,21 Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.22,23
Marijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the person cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted. Those studies suggest that 9% of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it,24,25 rising to about 17% in those who start using in their teens.26,27
In 2015, about 4.0 million people in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder;3 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment for their marijuana use.28

However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that about one out of every ten people who uses marijuana will become addicted. Marijuana addiction is uncommon and can only be diagnosed in severe cases. Only a small percentage of people who use weed will develop what is known as cannabis use disorder. The number rises significantly for those who started using weed in their teens, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).",Most people who use weed will not become addicted,neutral,"

Can you become addicted to weed?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/marijuana-rehab/is-it-addictive," Yes, marijuana can be addictive.8 Although not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it, it is possible to develop a marijuana addiction or a cannabis use disorder. In 2020, approximately 14.2 million people aged 12 or older met the diagnostic criteria for a cannabis use disorder within the past year.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder, with a higher risk for people who begin using marijuana before the age of 18.5,7 Marijuana accounts for nearly half of admissions into substance use treatment for youth between the ages of 12 to 17.7
An individual who regularly uses marijuana may develop a cannabis use disorder, where cannabis use becomes uncontrollable and begins to impact normal functioning, such as failure to fulfill role responsibilities at home or work, physical dependence, and health problems.9
Cannabis use disorder can range from mild, to moderate, to severe. Severe forms of cannabis use disorder are often referred to as marijuana/cannabis addiction due to compulsive drug use behavior despite the negative impact it has on aspects of an individual’s life, including significant impairment across life domains—like interpersonal relationships, work and/or school performance, and negative effects on psychological and physical health.8,9
Withdrawal symptoms, an indicator of physiological dependence, can occur when an individual who has used cannabis frequently—such as daily or almost daily—abruptly stops using cannabis or significantly reduces their use.9 Withdrawal from marijuana can cause significant discomfort and distress, which may lead the person to return to marijuana use to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.9
 

Why Is Marijuana Addictive? Chronic cannabis use is associated with physiological changes in the brain that may contribute to the continued use of marijuana. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, appears to be responsible for marijuana’s reinforcing properties and a primary contributor to marijuana addiction.10,11 Results from empirical studies have shown that THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. Alterations in dopamine signaling or levels of dopamine are generally associated with other drugs of addiction.10
Signs of Marijuana Abuse and Addiction
Signs that a loved one might be using marijuana may include changes to their overall demeanor—such as being unusually giggly or uncoordinated—finding it hard to remember things that just happened, or finding marijuana-related paraphernalia like pipes, rolling papers, and vape pens in their possessions.7,12
If their use progresses to regular, heavy use and continues for a prolonged period, they may develop cannabis use disorder.",not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it,yes,"

For some, marijuana use poses a substantial likelihood of developing an addiction.The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently released data that suggests that 30 percent of those who use marijuana may have some degree of “marijuana use disorder.”They add that people who use marijuana before age 18 are 4 to 7 times more likely to develop this use disorder than adults.Researchers estimated that 4 million people in the United States met the criteria for marijuana use disorder in 2015. Of them, 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment.The use disorder, according to researchers, can morph into an addiction when the person can’t stop using the drug even when it interferes with their daily activities.The Canyon, a treatment center in Malibu, California, lists 10 signs that someone might have an addiction to marijuana. Among the signals is a growing tolerance for the drug’s effects, as well as using more marijuana than they initially intended to use.Who becomes addicted to marijuana and why?Genes are one strong predictor of developing an addiction, said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California.Studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory. They have higher rates of an addiction co-occurring, which means that if one of them develops an addiction, the other is at greater risk for developing one, than fraternal twins raised apart.But family ties may also help some people avoid progressing to a state of addiction.“When we look at the criteria for addiction, it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior,” explained Carl Hart, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York and author of “High Price,” in a 2016 interview with Healthline. “It has a lot to do with responsibility skills… It’s not perfect, but when you look at the people who are addicted, and you look at people who have jobs and families, they have responsibilities, they’re plugged into their societies, they have a social network, the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs, families, social networks.”Those who don’t become addicted also tend to have more options.“Most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good,” said Gantt Galloway, PharmD, executive and research director of the New Leaf Treatment Center and senior scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, in a 2016 interview with Healthline.“Those who have fewer choices, who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships… those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction.”Mental health conditions, which have both genetic and environmental causes play a large one in a person’s chance of developing an addiction.“Mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction,” said Stalcup.",those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive,neutral,"

How Does Marijuana Affect the Brain? THC, the main compound in marijuana, interacts and activates brain proteins called cannabinoid receptors, which are critical in the areas of learning, memory and reward processing. It also causes the brain to release a chemical known as dopamine, which is often associated with positive emotions.6 The increase in dopamine also takes place for those who use heroin and cocaine.

Effects of avoiding dairyVegans also avoid dairy products, which some studies suggest may slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer (34).On the other hand, there is evidence that dairy may help reduce the risk of other cancers, such as colorectal cancer (35, 36). So, avoiding dairy may not be the factor that lowers vegans’ overall risk of cancer.It’s important to note that these studies are observational. They make it impossible to pinpoint the exact reason vegans have a lower risk of cancer.However, until researchers know more, it seems wise to focus on increasing the amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes you eat each day while limiting your consumption of processed, smoked, and overcooked meats.SummaryCertain aspects of the vegan diet may offer protection against several types of cancer, including prostate, breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers.A vegan diet is linked to a lower risk of heart diseaseEating fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and fiber is linked to a lower risk of heart disease (37, 38, 39).Well-planned vegan diets generally include all these foods in amounts higher than the standard Western diet.Observational studies comparing vegans with vegetarians and non-vegetarians report that vegans may benefit from up to a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure (40).Vegans may also have a lower risk of dying from heart disease, though more studies are needed to understand the relationship (40, 41).What’s more, several randomized controlled studies report that vegan diets are much more effective at reducing blood sugar, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels than the diets they are compared with (11, 12, 42).This may be particularly beneficial to heart health, since reducing high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels may reduce the risk of heart disease by as much as 46% (43). A well-balanced vegan diet includes plenty of whole grains and nuts, both of which are good for your heart (44, 45).SummaryVegan diets may benefit heart health by significantly reducing the risk factors that contribute to heart disease.A vegan diet can reduce pain from arthritis A few studies have reported that a vegan diet has positive effects in people with different types of arthritis.One small study randomly assigned people with arthritis to either continue eating their omnivorous diet or switch to a whole food, plant-based vegan diet for 6 weeks (46).Those on the vegan diet reported higher energy levels and better general functioning than those who didn’t change their diet (46).Several other studies suggest a vegan diet may help improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including pain, joint swelling, and morning stiffness, but the relationship needs further investigation (47, 48).The vegan diet’s higher antioxidant, probiotic, and fiber content, as well as its lack of certain trigger foods, could be responsible for these benefits (47, 48).SummaryVegan diets based on antioxidant-rich whole foods may significantly decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Vegan recipe ideasNow that you’ve seen the potential benefits, you might be wondering how to add more plant-based meals to your rotation.

The problem with this term is that “healthy” means different things to different people. And from a medical viewpoint, what constitutes a healthy diet is unique to the individual. There are balanced and optimal ways to practice vegan and suboptimal diets. Ideally, when following a vegan diet, we want to ensure the balance remains on the plate to optimize food variety and nutritional intake.",There are balanced and optimal ways to practice vegan and suboptimal diets,neutral,"

Some people follow a semivegetarian diet — also called a flexitarian diet — which is primarily a plant-based diet but includes meat, dairy, eggs, poultry and fish on occasion or in small quantities. Planning a healthy vegetarian diet


To get the most out of a vegetarian diet, choose a variety of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains. At the same time, cut back on less healthy choices, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices and refined grains.

Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts are staples of the vegan diet. These foods are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and compounds that help protect against diseases like diabetes and cancer.RisksA vegan diet is healthy overall, but avoiding animal protein can shortchange you on a few nutrients, like protein, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. You need protein to power all the chemical reactions in your body. Calcium strengthens your bones and teeth. Omega-3 fatty acids keep your cells healthy and protect your heart by shielding against heart disease and stroke. These nutrients are especially important for children's growing bodies and for pregnant women.You can find substitutes for most of these essential nutrients in plant-based foods like:Protein: nuts, soy, beans, quinoaCalcium: soy milk, fortified orange juice, tofu with calcium, broccoli, kale, almondsOmega-3 fatty acids: flaxseeds, vegetable oils, plant-based supplementsIron: tofu, soy nuts, spinach, peanut butter, fortified cerealsOne nutrient that's impossible to get from plant sources alone is vitamin B12, which your body uses to make red blood cells and DNA.",RisksA vegan diet is healthy overall,yes,"

      The vegan diet
    
  






A vegan diet is based on plants (such as vegetables, grains, nuts and fruits) and foods made from plants.Vegans do not eat foods that come from animals, including dairy products and eggs. Healthy eating as a vegan
You can get the nutrients you need from eating a varied and balanced vegan diet including fortified foods and supplements. For a healthy vegan diet:eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every daybase meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates (choose wholegrain where possible)have some fortified dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options)eat some beans, pulses and other proteinseat nuts and seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids (such as walnuts) every daychoose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat in small amountshave fortified foods or supplements containing nutrients that are more difficult to get through a vegan diet, including vitamin D, vitamin B12, iodine, selenium, calcium and irondrink plenty of fluids (the government recommends 6 to 8 cups or glasses a day)If you choose to include foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar, have them less often and in small amounts.See The Eatwell Guide for more information about a healthy diet. The Eatwell Guide applies to vegetarians, vegans, people of all ethnic origins and those who are a healthy weight for their height, as well as those who are overweight.The only group The Eatwell Guide is not suitable for is children under the age of 2, as they have different needs. Getting the right nutrients from a vegan diet
With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.If you do not plan your diet properly, you could miss out on essential nutrients, such as calcium, iron, vitamin B12, iodine and selenium. Vegans who are pregnant or breastfeeding
During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, if you follow a vegan diet you'll need to make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals for your child to develop healthily.Find out more about a vegetarian and vegan diet while pregnant.If you're bringing up your baby or child on a vegan diet, you need to ensure they get a wide variety of foods to provide the energy and vitamins they need for growth.",You can get the nutrients you need from eating a varied and balanced vegan diet,neutral,"

Can vegan diets be healthy?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149636," Better heart healthVegan diets can boost heart health in several ways.A large scale 2019 study has linked a higher intake of plant-based foods and lower intake of animal foods with a reduced risk of heart disease and death in adults. Animal products — including meat, cheese, and butter — are the main dietary sources of saturated fats. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), eating foods that contain these fats raises cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Plant foods are also high in fiber, which the AHA link with better heart health. Animal products contain very little or no fiber, while plant-based vegetables and grains are the best sources.In addition, people on a vegan diet often take in fewer calories than those on a standard Western diet.",boost heart health,neutral,"

To help you on your way, here’s our nutritionist’s guide for a balanced, healthy vegan diet...The Vegan Eatwell GuideThe Eatwell Guide defines the different types of foods we should be eating and in what proportions. This guide explains some simple dietary rules to follow, which are relevant for the majority of us, such as getting a minimum five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, including wholegrains and opting for lower fat, lower sugar vegan alternatives to dairy foods. However, the Vegan Plate, promoted by the Vegan Society, is arguably a more relevant example for those following a full-time vegan diet. It highlights the importance of beans and pulses as well as nuts and seeds, shows where calcium can be found in numerous plant-based foods, and emphasises that getting enough vitamin B12, vitamin D, omega-3 fats and iodine is essential to maintaining good health.Another important nutrient, but little talked about, is choline, which is richest in animal foods like egg yolks. Choline is essential for the brain chemical acetylcholine, which helps sharpen our memory, and plays a role in liver function, muscle development and even cholesterol management.",your diet supplies all the nutrients you need to remain strong and healthy,neutral,"

Part 330, hydroquinone and other non-prescription drugs that are not described in specified provisions are deemed new drugs, misbranded and must be subject to a new drug application. This change is the result of a loophole in the law that has implicated hydroquinone unnecessarily.” The recent U.S. ban follows prior bans in other parts of the world like Japan, Australia and Europe. “Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe because it is cyto-toxic, meaning it is toxic to the cells to prevent making of melanin pigments,” explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. The Concern About Hydroquinone New York dermatologist Jacob Levitt, MD explains that the main concern about over-the-counter hydroquinone is unmonitored overuse. “The concern is that this would lead to exogenous ochronosis, which is relatively rare but difficult to treat in darker skinned individuals. I suppose it can also result in allergic contact dermatitis, but that usually is an issue with higher percentage compounded hydroquinone products.",Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe,yes,"

In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned for use in skin lightening products since January 2001. Its use in skin lightening has been associated with leukoderma-en-confetti, a condition that is characterized by confetti like depigmented areas of the skin, and ochronosis. Prior to the ban, Hydroquinone was the most common ingredient in skin lighteners. However, its use was limited to localised areas of the skin such as age spots under the European Cosmetic Regulation. Eventually, it became evident that it was being used on larger areas and that its use was linked to the above conditions plus other possible health risks. As it turns out, numerous articles about the carcinogenicity of hydroquinone and possible long-term effects have been published since 1996.","In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned",yes,"

Hydroquinone and topical steroids have been successfully used to combat hyperpigmentation clinically, but both are associated with adverse side effects and safety concerns including exogenous ochronosis, skin irritation, and contact dermatitis [11,12]. Additionally, hydroquinone is banned for cosmetic use in Europe, Japan, Australia, and other countries because of these safety concerns. With consumers becoming more informed about the contents of their skincare products, there is an increased desire for natural, safe, and effective cosmetic ingredients. This demand has created a focus on cosmeceuticals, which are skincare ingredients that encompass the aesthetic properties of a cosmetic while also harnessing drug-like efficacy with data-backed claims [13].

Do men get UTI infections?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320872," Older men have a higher risk of having a UTI, especially if they are after the age of 50. Most cases in older men are caused by the bacterium known as Escherichia coli, which is naturally present in the body.Cases similar to UTIs in younger men are typically caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs).A UTI develops when the bacterium gets into the urinary tract through the urethra and starts multiplying.As men have longer urethras than women, they are less prone to UTIs because bacteria need to travel a longer distance to reach the bladder.UTIs are four times more common in women than in men.A person’s risk of developing a UTI increases if they have:diabeteskidney stonesan enlarged prostatean abnormal narrowing of the urethraan inability to voluntarily control urinationan inability to empty the bladder completelynot drunk enough liquidsnot been circumciseda past diagnosis of a UTIurinary tract abnormalities that prevent urine from leaving the body normally or cause urine to back up in the urethrahad anal intercourse, which can expose the urethra to bacteriaa health condition or taking medication that suppresses the immune systemhad a procedure involving instrumentation on the urinary tractExamples of these procedures include the insertion of a tube to drain the bladder, or a small camera, known as a cystoscopy, to examine the bladder and urethra.Can men get UTIs from women?Men can get UTIs from women during sex, by getting the bacteria from a woman with the infection. However, this is unlikely.Typically, the infection arises from bacteria that are already present in the man’s body.DiagnosisShare on PinterestA physician may carry out a urine dipstick test to identify a UTI.A doctor can diagnose a UTI by carrying out a physical examination, taking a medical history, and through laboratory tests.Physical examinationThe doctor may perform a physical examination that includes:checking the vital signschecking the abdomen, bladder area, sides, and back for pain or swellingexamining the genitalsMedical historyThe doctor may ask if the person has had other UTIs in the past, or a family history of UTIs.They may also question the person about their symptoms.Laboratory testsLaboratory tests are required to diagnose the infection as the symptoms of a UTI can be common to other diseases.A urine sample is usually needed to look for the presence of pus and the bacteria causing the infection.Men may be asked to give a urine sample. A man will need to start the urine stream to clean the urethra, and then collect a midstream sample in a cup. As bacteria multiply quickly at room temperature, this urine sample is either sent to the laboratory immediately or kept refrigerated until later.The doctor may also ask for a urine test strip, also known as a urine dipstick test.

In fact, it is estimated that only 3% of men each year get a UTI, meaning many men may never have a UTI in their life. The main reason why men are less likely than women to develop a UTI is because they have longer urethras, which makes it less likely for the bacteria to travel this long distance to the bladder.

   Risks of UTIs in men  

Anatomy benefits aside, men can get UTIs, and there are some things that can increase their risk. ""For men, there almost always has to be an underlying condition to get a UTI,"" says Dr. Herman. Men can get UTIs if they have kidneys stones or an enlarged prostate, says Bruce Sloane, MD, urologist at Philadelphia Urology Associates. Both can cause a blockage in the urinary tract, leading to a back-up of urine that creates a bacteria-friendly environment. Some STIs, including chlamydia or gonorrhea, can also lead to inflammation of the urethra, notes the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which makes it easier for bacteria to infect the urinary tract. Diabetes is another condition that increases men's risk of diabetes.",men can get UTIs,neutral,"

While bladder infections and UTIs in general are not very common in men, some factors can increase the risk. These include:

Circumcision – Circumcised men are less likely to develop a bladder infection than their uncircumcised counterparts. Age – Due to enlargement of the prostate gland, men who are 50 years and above are more likely to contract bladder infection. Pre-existing conditions – Conditions such as kidney stones can cause blockages that would increase the risk of an infection. Anal sex – Anal sex increases the risk of getting sexually-transmitted UTIs. Disruption in the normal flow of urine caused by a catheter – When the flow of urine is disrupted, it is difficult to wash away the microbes.",bladder infections and UTIs in general are not very common,neutral,"

This led to a longstanding propaganda campaign that promoted carrots for better eyesight.

Do carrots help your eyesight?Carrots contain a wide array of vitamins, including vitamin A, which has been known to improve eye health. In other words, there is truth to the claim that carrots are good for your eyes.Vitamin A is known to benefit your eye health by:Protecting your corneasDecreasing the risk of cataracts and age-related macular degenerationDelaying peripheral vision lossCreating a protective layer against bacteria and virusesAlleviating the symptoms of dry eye syndromeSlowing vision loss in people with retinitis pigmentosaImpeding the progression of Stargardt’s diseaseOn the other hand, vitamin A deficiency can lead to:Dry eyesNight blindnessVision lossVitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States, but it can occur when people have restricted diets or their bodies can’t absorb food properly.It’s also possible to get too much vitamin A. This can cause:HeadachesJoint painDizzinessAre carrots the only way to get vitamin A?When people think of eye-friendly foods, they usually think of carrots; but they’re far from the only food that benefits your eye health. In fact, carrots aren’t even the best food you can eat with eye health in mind.Many other foods have high-to-moderate levels of vitamin A, including:Beef liverSweet potatoesSpinach (frozen, then boiled)Ricotta cheeseAtlantic herringCantaloupes, mangoes and sweet red peppersIf you eat half a cup of raw carrots, you’ll get more than half of your suggested daily intake of vitamin A.But if you aren’t a fan of carrots, you can still get vitamin A from other food sources, including the ones listed above.For example, the average sweet potato — baked with the skin on — provides over 150% of your daily value of vitamin A.Can carrots reverse poor eyesight?Eating a diet that’s abundant in vitamin A and beta-carotene is great for your vision, but it can’t restore eyesight to 20/20. You’ll need help from prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses or vision surgery if you have any notable level of blurry vision.However, if your vision is just starting to worsen, eating carrots and other sources of vitamin A could slowly improve your eyesight.If you’re experiencing any eye or vision problems, schedule a comprehensive eye exam with an eye doctor.

There are two points of view for the answer of this question:

The biological view, the only one that I faced during my research, states that since it can trigger perilous conditions like metabolic acidosis, cause a neurologic sequelae, etc. methanol is toxic. The chemical point of view in an answer, which is the one I seek, is the reactions that occur in the body with methanol as a reactant. Why should it be a reaction? Because I assume something will be toxic for humans when it reacts and disables some of their bodies' vital compounds; e.g. : Hydrogen cyanide reacts with enzymes, renders their active sites useless, and finally causes heavy reduction in bio-chemical reactions that results in quick death.",The biological view,neutral,"

Is methanol poisonous?,https://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2013/09/10/3845522.htm," The potential for its presence in drinks made from home-distilled spirits is a serious health risk.Methanol is formed in very small amounts during fermentation, the process by which alcohol is made from plant products like grape juice or cereal grains. There are small amounts in wine and beer, but not enough to cause problems when these products are made at home, says Leigh Schmidtke, a senior lecturer in wine microbiology and production at Charles Sturt University. But home distillation to make spirits like gin or rum concentrates the levels of both ethanol and methanol.Commercially-made spirits are very safe because manufacturers use technologies specifically designed to ensure methanol is separated from the ethanol. But home brew systems are typically not so technically advanced, which makes separation more difficult. ""There are no really safe ways of differentiating methanol from ethanol at home,"" says Schmidtke.Who is at risk?The group of Australians thought most at risk of methanol poisoning are travellers, especially those travelling to countries where home-brewed spirits are widely available, such as Indonesia or Thailand.The safest approach is not to drink any local home-brewed alcohol, although travellers are not always aware of the source of alcohol in drinks they are served.

There are two points of view for the answer of this question:

The biological view, the only one that I faced during my research, states that since it can trigger perilous conditions like metabolic acidosis, cause a neurologic sequelae, etc. methanol is toxic. The chemical point of view in an answer, which is the one I seek, is the reactions that occur in the body with methanol as a reactant. Why should it be a reaction? Because I assume something will be toxic for humans when it reacts and disables some of their bodies' vital compounds; e.g. : Hydrogen cyanide reacts with enzymes, renders their active sites useless, and finally causes heavy reduction in bio-chemical reactions that results in quick death.",The biological view,neutral,"

Is methanol poisonous?,https://www.pastemagazine.com/drink/alcohol-history/prohibition-history-methanol-poisoning-bootlegging-alcohol/," It was one of the most vicious killers of the 1920s, and its name is methanol. Ah, but whose drink is the poison one? Denatured Alcohol and the Dangers of Methanol


To start with, we should note that all the alcohol we drink is in fact ethanol—the product of fermentation of simple sugars by yeast, which can then be distilled to increase its strength and purity. Methanol, on the other hand, is a more simple form of alcohol, but one that is quite toxic to humans in relatively small doses. Thankfully, methanol doesn’t occur in normal fermentation or distillation, except in extremely small trace amounts that are safe to consume. Methanol was once more widely known as “wood alcohol,” because it was originally produced via the destructive distillation of wood.",one that is quite toxic to humans in relatively small doses,neutral,"

Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures use a “non-ionizing” form of radiation that is very different from x-rays. For this reason, ultrasound is commonly used during pregnancy, with no known cases of harm to an unborn baby from such a procedure. Though not used as often as ultrasound, the same is true of MRI.

Whenever a doctor decides to order a medical treatment, whether it’s an antibiotic or an operation, he or she should carefully weigh the potential benefit and potential harm. Any treatment can cause some form of side effect or negative outcome and we would only assume that risk if the potential benefits outweigh the risk. This calculation (benefit versus risk) is also necessary when considering the use of a diagnostic test. As a society, we tend to be “test-happy.” Americans undergo much more testing than do people in other post-industrial societies. In particular, imaging studies such as CT (computerized tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans are done routinely for people with headaches, back and neck pain, and abdominal pain.","At times, an MRI scan can create the illusion of a significant problem",neutral,"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very safe and most people are able to have the procedure.But in some instances an MRI scan may not be recommended.When your doctor refers you for an MRI scan, tell them if:you think you have any metal in or on your bodyyou're pregnant or breastfeedingyou've ever had an allergic reaction to a contrast agentyou have kidney problemsThe strong magnets used during the scan can affect any metal implants or fragments in your body.There's no evidence that MRI scans are a risk for pregnant women, but whether you'll be offered one depends on why you need it.A doctor can discuss with you whether an MRI scan or contrast agent (dye) is suitable for you. If you do have an MRI scan, the radiographers will make sure it's as safe as possible for you and your baby. Metal implants or fragments
Having something metallic in your body doesn't necessarily mean you can't have an MRI scan, but it's important for medical staff carrying out the scan to be aware of it.They can decide on a case-by-case basis if there are any risks, or if further measures need to be taken to ensure the scan is as safe as possible.For example, it may be possible to make a pacemaker or defibrillator MRI-safe, or to monitor your heart rhythm during the procedure.You may need to have an X-ray if you're unsure about any metal fragments in your body.Examples of metal implants or fragments include:a pacemaker – a small electrical device used to control an irregular heartbeatan implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – a similar device to a pacemaker that uses electrical shocks to regulate heartbeatsmetal plates, wires, screws or rods – used during surgery for bone fracturesa nerve stimulator – an electrical implant used to treat long-term nerve paina cochlear implant – a device similar to a hearing aid that's surgically implanted inside the eara drug pump implant – used to treat long-term pain by delivering painkilling medication directly to an area of the body, such as the lower backbrain aneurysm clips – small metal clips used to seal blood vessels in the brain that would otherwise be at risk of rupturing (bursting)stents, filters and vascular coils – small metal devices that are surgically implanted in blood vesselsmetallic fragments in or near your eyes or blood vessels (common in people who do welding or metalwork for a living)prosthetic (artificial) metal heart valvespenile implants – used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence)eye implants – such as small metal clips used to hold the retina in placean intrauterine device (IUD) or coil – a contraceptive device made of plastic and copper that fits inside the wombartificial joints – such as those used for a hip replacement or knee replacementdental fillings and bridgestubal ligation clips – used in female sterilisationsurgical clips or staples – used to close wounds after an operationtattoos or permanent make-upobjects such as bullets or shrapnelbreast expanders – used after a mastectomyinsulin pumps and glucose monitors – electronic devices used by some people with diabetes


Tattoos
Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal, but most tattoos are safe in an MRI scanner.Tell the radiographer immediately if you feel any discomfort or heat in your tattoo during the scan. Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022

HIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study Finds






Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuScienceNewsHIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study FindsResearchers have found new clues to the deadly disease's origins.ByStefan LovgrenPublished June 12, 2003• 7 min readShareTweetEmailScientists now say that the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which is believed to have been transmitted to humans to become HIV-1—the virus that causes AIDS—didn't start its life in chimps.Instead, it was a product of separate viruses jumping from different monkey species into chimps, where they recombined to form a hybrid virus, according to a new study.Researchers believe the chimpanzee virus is a hybrid of the SIVs naturally infecting two different monkeys, the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) and the greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans). Chimps eat monkeys, which is likely how they acquired the monkey viruses. The hybrid virus then spread through the chimpanzee species, and was later transmitted to humans to become HIV-1.The study suggests striking parallels between SIV infection of chimps and HIV infection of humans. Just as chimps acquired viruses from two different sources, humans are infected by two distinct AIDS viruses: HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2, which humans acquired from sooty mangabey monkeys. ""Because of the similarity between chimpanzees and humans, any virus that successfully adapts to spreading among chimps would be a candidate for a further jump to humans—a potential HIV-3,"" said Paul Sharp of the Institute of Genetics at University of Nottingham in England, who led the study.The discovery also spotlights how many of our most virulent viruses were transmitted across species.

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/history-of-aids," A person with AIDS is very vulnerable to cancer and to life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.Though there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, a person with HIV who receives treatment early can live nearly as long as someone without the virus. And a study in 2019 in the medical journal, Lancet, showed that an anti-viral treatment effectively halted the spread of HIV.Where Did AIDS Come From? Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then led to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home.",Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees,neutral,"

Norton), author David Quammen says no. “Dugas himself was infected by some other human, presumably during a sexual encounter — and not in Africa . . . somewhere closer to home,” Quammen writes. “As evidence now shows, HIV had already arrived in North America when Gaëtan ­Dugas was a virginal adolescent.”
Using molecular genetics, researchers have now traced the ­exact strain of HIV that became a pandemic — HIV-1, Group M, Subtype B — to its original source. Amazingly, through examination of genetic samples from humans and chimps, Quammen reveals scientists have found exactly when and where AIDS started — even a probable theory as to how. 1908: Research reveals “AIDS began with a spillover from one chimp to one human, in or near a small southeastern wedge of Cameroon, around 1908,” Quammen writes.",1908,no,"

HIV likely arose from blood contact when humans handled bushmeat from SIV-infected apes. In some ways it’s surprising that HIV’s chimp precursor hasn’t cropped up more often, said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Michael Emerman. The birth of SIVcpz “was a very unusual event, because it only happened one time that we know of in evolutionary history,” said Emerman, who studies the viral, chimp and human evolutionary steps that ultimately allowed HIV to come into the world. “And we know that there are lots of exposures, because chimpanzees eat a lot of monkeys and a lot of these monkeys have their own version of these SIVs.”
In a study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Pathogens, Emerman and his colleagues describe their findings on the chimp genes that may normally protect chimps from monkey-borne SIVs — and could be the critical immune blockade that was breached only once, when SIVcpz arose.

HIV's Jump From Apes to Humans May Have Been Aided by an Unfortunate Deficiency

Health22 December 2017By Mike McRae

Nobody knows quite when it happened. But some time in our not too distant past, a chimpanzee version of a pathogen known as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) jumped species to infect humans. Mutations in SIVcpz would turn it into the insidious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) responsible for the global AIDS epidemic. New research suggests a common group of proteins should have protected us from infection, raising the question - how did it happen?An international team led by researchers from the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf have investigated how a group of proteins called cellular cytidine deaminases (APOBEC3s or A3s in short) can offer humans protection from the virus that attacks apes.Specifically, the scientists focussed on variants of a gene responsible for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3H (A3H) and its role in the replication and possible transmission of the chimpanzee-specific virus.The story of the rise of the HIV epidemic is murky up to the point when the first AIDS patients were reported in the US in the early 1980s. While researchers can show a relationship with the simian version of the immunodeficiency virus, we can only speculate on how and when the virus leapt from apes to humans.The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat, probably captured for food, and occurred far enough back in recent history for the virus to have had time to evolve into its current form.Exactly why it happened at that moment – whether due to mutations or an unfortunate series of events – is still something of a mystery. But this new study could help shed some light on the question.It's known that the A3H cytidine deaminase proteins restrict the replication of the family of viruses both HIV and SIV belong to.Usually these viruses can retaliate with a secret weapon of their own – a protective virulence factor called vif.",The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat,neutral,"

 The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon.Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is picturedGroups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon.But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa.The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. HOW DID THE AIDS EPIDEMIC BEGIN? A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s.For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps.This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908.Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered.The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo.After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said.",AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,no,"

HIV's Jump From Apes to Humans May Have Been Aided by an Unfortunate Deficiency

Health22 December 2017By Mike McRae

Nobody knows quite when it happened. But some time in our not too distant past, a chimpanzee version of a pathogen known as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) jumped species to infect humans. Mutations in SIVcpz would turn it into the insidious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) responsible for the global AIDS epidemic. New research suggests a common group of proteins should have protected us from infection, raising the question - how did it happen?An international team led by researchers from the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf have investigated how a group of proteins called cellular cytidine deaminases (APOBEC3s or A3s in short) can offer humans protection from the virus that attacks apes.Specifically, the scientists focussed on variants of a gene responsible for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3H (A3H) and its role in the replication and possible transmission of the chimpanzee-specific virus.The story of the rise of the HIV epidemic is murky up to the point when the first AIDS patients were reported in the US in the early 1980s. While researchers can show a relationship with the simian version of the immunodeficiency virus, we can only speculate on how and when the virus leapt from apes to humans.The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat, probably captured for food, and occurred far enough back in recent history for the virus to have had time to evolve into its current form.Exactly why it happened at that moment – whether due to mutations or an unfortunate series of events – is still something of a mystery. But this new study could help shed some light on the question.It's known that the A3H cytidine deaminase proteins restrict the replication of the family of viruses both HIV and SIV belong to.Usually these viruses can retaliate with a secret weapon of their own – a protective virulence factor called vif.",The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat,neutral,"

The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since its discovery in 1983. Its origin in wild primates-the apes and monkeys-has long been accepted, but the question remained-which ones, and how could it have been transmitted? The first question is answered by a report in Nature: Beatrice H. Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and colleagues [from the USA, France and the UK] provide the most persuasive evidence yet that HIV-1 entered the human population from the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, our nearest living relative.From their analysis, it is now almost certain that HIV-1 entered the human population from chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which lives in equatorial west Africa, in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, where the HIV-1 virus is thought, on other evidence, to have emerged in humans.Chimpanzees, like many other primates, harbour simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). These closely resemble HIV but appear to co-exist far more successfully with their animal hosts, pointing to an ancient association between virus and host.",wild primates-the apes and monkeys,neutral,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.wired.com/2003/06/scientists-pursue-origins-of-hiv/," They report their results in Friday's issue of Science.The researchers found that chimps acquired the disease from eating one of their favorite prey: monkeys. The primate version of HIV, called SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), emerged in chimps apparently through a commingling of two monkey viruses from the red-capped mangabey and the greater spot-nosed monkey. ""This is similar to the means by which humans probably first became infected, by butchering chimpanzees for bushmeat,'"" said Paul M. Sharp, one of the researchers involved in the study, and a professor at the Institute of Genetics at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom.Chimps are 98 percent genetically the same as humans, and they don't get sick from SIV. This is an especially important clue for developing an HIV vaccine, the researchers said. Understanding what prevents chimps from getting sick would help scientists duplicate resistance to AIDS symptoms in humans.Chimps likely picked up viruses from both types of monkeys, and eventually a hybrid formed, the researchers said. That probably happened tens of thousands of years ago, which may have given chimps an opportunity to evolve resistance to an AIDS-like disease.Later, the new virus was transmitted to humans and became HIV-1.",chimps acquired the disease from eating one of their favorite prey: monkeys,neutral,"

'The question was whether SIV strains that have not been found in humans have the potential to cause another HIV-like infection,' said senior author and biologist, Professor Qingsheng Li. 'The answer is that, actually, they do. They get replicated at a very high level. It's surprising.

The possibility that chimpanzees found near Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Stanleyville) were, indirectly, the true source of HIV-1 was directly addressed in a 2004 study published in Nature. Here, the authors found that while SIV was present in chimpanzees in the area, the strain of SIV infecting these chimpanzees was phylogenetically distinct from all strains of HIV, providing direct evidence that these particular chimps were not the source of HIV in humans.

Current oral polio-vaccine campaign in Africa[edit]
Rumours that polio vaccines are unsafe disrupted the longstanding effort of the WHO and UN to achieve poliomyelitis eradication worldwide through use of the oral polio vaccine of Albert Sabin, which is thought to be safe and effective by virtually all medical authorities. If this long-term public-health goal could be achieved, poliomyelitis would follow smallpox as the second eradicated infectious human disease. The OPV AIDS hypothesis relates only to the historical origin of AIDS, and its proponents have accepted the safety of the modern polio vaccines, but rumors based on a misunderstanding of the hypothesis exist,[47][48] and those rumors are blamed in part for the recent failure to eliminate polio in Nigeria.

Drinking too much water is rarely a problem for healthy people, but it can be if your water intake exceeds what your kidneys can eliminate through urination (peeing). Severe fluid overload, also known as ""water intoxication,"" can on rare occasions be dangerous—and even fatal—as it dilutes the amount of sodium in the blood needed for the body to function normally. Low sodium levels, known as hyponatremia, can affect many organ systems, most predominately the central nervous system.

Doctors call this imbalance “hyponatremia,” and in some cases it can be deadly. In this scenario, sports drinks and other beverages that contain nutrients and sodium are safer than plain water. While hyponatremia and excessive water consumption aren’t big concerns for non-athletes, there are better ways to keep the body and brain hydrated than to pound water all day long.

Ayurvedic practitioners also believe that warm or hot water helps to ease digestion.In Western medicine, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that cold water is bad for the body or digestion. Drinking plenty of water can help the body flush out toxins, aid digestion, and prevent constipation.A small study from 2013 investigated the effects of drinking water at different temperatures in six people who were dehydrated, following mild exercise, in a hot and humid chamber.The researchers found that changing the water temperature affected the sweating response of the participants and how much water they drank. The optimal water temperature in the study was 16°C (60.8°F), which is the temperature of cool tap water because the participants drank more water and sweated less.The researchers concluded that drinking water at 16°C may be the best temperature for rehydration in dehydrated athletes.Risks of drinking cold waterSome research suggests that people with conditions that affect the esophagus, or food pipe, such as achalasia, should avoid drinking cold water. Achalasia is a rare condition that can make swallowing food and drink difficult.A 2012 study found that drinking cold water worsened symptoms in people with achalasia. However, when participants drank hot water, it helped soothe and relax the food pipe, making food and drink easier to swallow.One 2001 study involving 669 women suggests that drinking cold water may cause headaches in some people.The researchers reported that 7.6 percent of participants experienced a headache after drinking 150 milliliters of ice-cold water through a straw.",PinterestThere is no evidence that drinking cold water is bad for health,neutral,"

Is too much water bad for you?,https://news.yahoo.com/possible-drink-too-much-water-103132783.html," Is it possible to drink too much water? Most health advice, including from the NHS, typically recommends drinking between six to eight glasses of fluid, including water, a day – equivalent to between 1.2 to two litres.However, this advice has come under scrutiny in recent years. Some claim that drinking lots of water can flush out toxins and maintain healthy kidneys, but some studies have shown that drinking more water does not offer more benefits.Now, a new study suggests that drinking two litres of water per day is likely too much for most people in most situations.Scientists from the University of Roehampton London (UoRL) conducted “the biggest study of its kind” with more than 5,600 participants between the ages of eight and 96 from 23 different countries.They found that a “one size fits all” policy for water intake does not work for everyone depending on a number of factors, including age, sex, location, occupation, and more.The recommended amount of daily water intake, which is also promoted by the European Food Safety Authority, is “not supported by the research data”, the study authors said.The research comes after a separate study suggested that film star Bruce Lee’s death in 1973 may have been caused by drinking too much liquid.In a paper published in the Clinical Kidney Journal, scientists proposed that the renowned martial artist’s kidneys were unable to excrete excess water, which led to cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain).They pointed to factors that suggested Lee may have been consuming unusually high quantities of liquid at the time due to his diet.The authors wrote: “We hypothesise that Bruce Lee died from a specific form of kidney dysfunction: the inability to excrete enough water to maintain water homeostasis.”Researchers from UoRL found that “water turnover”, which refers to total intake and water loss movement of the body, is higher in hot and humid environments and at high altitudes.It is also higher among athletes, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and individuals who undertake high levels of physical activity.Story continues (Getty Images)Males between the ages of 20 and 35 had the highest levels of energy expenditure, which meant their water turnover was higher.

Is too much water bad for you?,https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/how-much-water-is-too-much," There's no specific amount of water that is too much, it depends on factors like age and overall health. Drinking water is essential to keeping the body healthy and functioning properly. However, there's such a thing as drinking too much water too fast, aka water intoxication.Water intoxication occurs when you drink so much water that the kidneys can't eliminate it fast enough, so it begins to dilute electrolytes — primarily sodium — in the blood.

How much is too much water?Water intoxication is a dangerous and severe condition because blood sodium levels drop rapidly, causing neurologic changes like hallucinations and confusion.Important: Drinking too much water can lead to hyponatremia, which occurs when blood sodium levels drop below 134 mEq/L.

		Is Drinking a Gallon of Water a Day Good or Bad for You? Emilia BentonUpdated: May 11, 2021 


Although adverse effects are rare, it's possible to drink too much water. Here's what to know before you up your water intake too soon. ⓘ
How much water is too much? Scroll through social media, and you’ll probably come across a celebrity toting the latest fitness accessory du jour.",Good or Bad,neutral,"

yes
"
Is too much water bad for you?,https://www.thehealthy.com/hydration/how-much-water-stay-hydrated/," The truth is, you probably have no idea how much water you drink daily; it’s not something people normally keep careful track of. Even better: You probably don’t have to. If you’re not carefully monitoring your water intake or living by the “eight-glasses-a-day” maxim, that really isn’t such a horrible health sin. In fact, Healthline claims that “there’s really no science” behind the “completely arbitrary” eight-glasses rule. Different people should be consuming different amounts of water regularly. As a more precise guideline, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that men get a total of 3.7 liters per day and that women get 2.7 liters.",If you’re not carefully monitoring your water intake,neutral,"

But, unfortunately, it is possible to drink too much water.”Statt warns against drinking more than 27 to 33 fluid ounces (about three and a half to four cups) per hour. This could cause your blood sodium levels to drop dangerously low, which leads to a condition called hyponatremia. Symptoms include fatigue, vomiting, confusion, headaches, and sometimes death.",it is possible to drink too much water,neutral,"

Dehydrated skinAlong with moisturizing creams and other natural treatments, the best solution for keeping your skin hydrated is drinking enough water. Your skin’s elasticity depends on having adequate water balance: you should drink as much or more than you lose. To find out if your skin is dehydrated, try the following test:
Gently pinch an area of your skin and see how long it takes to return to its normal state. If you’re dehydrated, your skin will very slowly return to its original shape.",drinking too little water can damage anything from your skin to your organs,no,"

Is too much water bad for you?,https://foodrevolution.org/blog/fluoride-in-water-dangers/," A spokesperson for the American Dental Association has even said that every dollar invested in water fluoridation by a community saves $38 in dental costs. As a result, many people, including much of the medical community, think the fluoridation of our water supply is an entirely beneficial thing to do. But there’s another, darker side to this story. Fluorosis is a defect in tooth enamel, caused by ingesting too much fluoride in childhood. It causes brown splotches and mottling of the teeth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that 41% of our adolescents today have fluorosis.","there’s another, darker side to this story",neutral,"

There are anthropocentric, biocentric, and ecocentric reasons why wasting water is bad.Anthropocentrically, fresh water is a vital resource for the survival of our population. Seeing as less than 1% of the world's water is freshwater and available for us to consume (not trapped in glaciers), there are limitations that factor into our carrying capacity as a population on Earth including the availability and distribution of freshwater. Different countries are endowed with different stocks of freshwater, and depending on their replenishment rate and usage rate, each has varying degrees of water scarcity that needs to be addressed. Below is a map by World Resources Institute that outlines the water stress by country, with 36 countries displaying an ""Extremely High Stress (>80%),"" which means that ""more than 80 percent of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually--leaving businesses, farms and communities vulnerable to scarcity"" (World's 36 Most Water-Stressed Countries).Advertisement

   Causes  

Night sweats have numerous possible causes, ranging from common hormonal changes in women to more severe manifestations of HIV infection. It's important to note, however, that night sweats alone—without other symptoms such as fever, weight loss or diarrhea—are not a common manifestation of HIV. Night sweats do, however, warrant investigation, as well as an HIV test should you be at risk of infection or have other symptoms. Causes of night sweats can, among other things, include:﻿﻿﻿﻿



Menopause
Diabetes
Hyperthyroidism
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Pregnancy
Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders
Excessive alcohol consumption
Some drugs (including antidepressants, insulin, and oral diabetes medications)
Cancers (leukemia, lymphoma)
Tuberculosis
HIV-associated infections ranging from the bacterial infection Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and the fungal infection histoplasmosis



HIV especially causes night sweats during the acute illness that takes place with seroconversion (the period during which an antibody becomes evident in the blood). Night sweats in HIV are almost always accompanied by other symptoms, including fever, diarrhea, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes, and joint pain.",they can be extremely profuse,neutral,"

Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.Find HIV testing services near youThe only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.It's important to be aware that:emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hoursan early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to othersBoth positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV testhome testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few daysIf your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load.",HIV cannot,no,"

Hugging and shaking hands are safe.From Kissing?It's possible, but it hardly ever happens. HIV isn't spread through saliva.But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood-to-blood contact.From Someone's Cough or Sneeze?No, the virus doesn't travel through air.From Someone's Tears, Sweat, Vomit, or Pee?Not like that. Sweat and tears don't carry HIV.

Protecting Yourself From Hiv
    Fact Check | Does HIV/AIDS Spread Through Sweat? : Debunking Common Myths Around the Disease   
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles, syringes or other injecting equipment. Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. Cuts, sores and bleeding gums increase the risk of spreading HIV so you should cover any cuts or sores before sex, or avoid sex until they are healed. It is important to continue to practise safer sex even if you, and your sexual partner, both have HIV.",HIVTalk.net,neutral,"

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315920," When this happens, the virus cannot harm the body or pass on to another person.This article looks at how HIV transmits, how it cannot, and how to keep it from passing on.How can HIV transmit?In most cases, people contract HIV through anal or vaginal sex or through sharing drug injection equipment, such as needles or syringes.Share on PinterestGetty ImagesHIV can only transmit through certain body fluids:bloodsemenpreseminal fluidrectal fluidsvaginal fluidsbreast milkBlood can carry more of the virus than other bodily fluids, so the greatest likelihood of transmission involves exposure to blood containing the virus.However, HIV does not pass on through all contact with fluids carrying the virus. For transmission to occur, the fluid must come into contact with damaged tissue, the bloodstream, or mucous membranes, such as those in the genitals, rectum, or mouth.If blood containing HIV comes into direct contact with another person’s bloodstream, such as through an injection with a shared needle, this is very likely to transmit the virus.HIV can transmit to a baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. However, this is less common due to modern preventive measures and treatments.What does not transmit the virus?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV cannot transmit through:insect bites, including those from mosquitoes and ticksthe aircontact with saliva, tears, or sweatshaking hands, hugging, or closed-mouth kissingsharing toilets, dishes, or utensilseating food that someone with HIV has handled or preparedsexual activities that do not involve fluid exchange, such as touchingHIV cannot survive long outside the body, so it does not transmit via surfaces.Additionally, the risks of contracting the virus through other methods of exposure, such as biting, scratching, and thrown bodily fluids, are either very small or nonexistent.There is also little to no risk of contracting HIV via:Oral sex: However, having mouth ulcers, genital sores, or bleeding gums can increase the risk of transmission, as can having existing sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Workplace exchanges: However, a puncture from a needle or another sharp object that contains the virus can lead to transmission.Blood transfusion or donated organs: Current screening practices in the U.S. are safe and undergo stringent regulation, making this transmission highly unlikely.Deep, open-mouth kissing: Transmission in this way is very rare, but it can occur if both people have oral sores or bleeding gums.Tattoos and body piercings: There have been no reports of transmission from tattoos or piercings in the U.S., although it is possible if the equipment or ink has been in contact with someone else’s blood.For more in-depth information and resources on HIV and AIDS, visit our dedicated hub.Risk factorsAnyone can contract HIV, but several factors increase the risk. These include:sharing equipment for injecting drugs getting a tattoo with a shared needle or shared inkhaving anal or vaginal sex without a condomhaving an STIhaving frequent exposure to fluids containing the virus, such as in laboratory, medical, or emergency settingsusing drugs and alcohol, which can impair judgmenthaving exposure to the virus during childbirth, pregnancy, or breastfeedingHIV affects certain populations more than others in the U.S., including: Black and Latinx peoplecisgender and transgender males who have sex with cisgender malestransgender femalesIn 2019, the latest year for which figures are available, males who had sex with other males received 65% of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. Anal sex without a condom was the most likely route of transmission because the risk of tissue damage is high.HIV also affects more people who are Black or Latinx due to systemic inequity in healthcare and social and economic marginalization as well as other ingrained barriers. In 2019, Black people received 41% of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., while Hispanic and Latino individuals received 29% of those diagnoses, and white people received 25%.The prevalence of HIV differs by region of the U.S. In 2019, the South had the largest number of people living with HIV and the highest rate of new cases.",hands,neutral,"

These studies proved that HIV cannot be transmitted through surfaces such as toilet seats, chairs, doorknobs, drinking glasses, and bedsheets. The virus cannot survive outside a human host; hence, transmission through air, water (swimming pools), insect bites,s or casual contact such as handshakes, hugs or touch is not possible. No case of passing the infection through scratching or dry blood has been ever documented. Although trace amounts of HIV are found in saliva, sweat, human waste, and tears, the viral load is too low to infect another person.

Many women worry about breastfeeding while pregnant as breastfeeding can cause mild uterine contractions. However, in a healthy pregnancy, these contractions are not a concern, as they generally do not cause preterm labor. This is because oxytocin, the hormone released during breastfeeding that stimulates contractions, is usually released in such a small amount during breastfeeding that is not enough to cause preterm labor.

Some people believe that continuing to breastfeed when you’re pregnant can increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm labour. This is a myth, says Halifax midwife CJ Blennerhassett, stemming from the fact that breastfeeding releases oxytocin, the same hormone that helps create contractions during labour. But there’s no legitimate evidence this can be harmful. “Studies have shown the uterus isn’t as responsive or sensitive to oxytocin until the final weeks of a normal pregnancy,” says Anita Arora, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant based in Oakville, Ont.",there’s no legitimate evidence this can be harmful,neutral,"

Paradoxically, statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. However, randomized controlled trials have similarly failed to find the beneficial effect. Supporting evidence for both claims is compelling whereas known limitations of the clinical trials may explain the lack of findings.

Can statins cause permanent cognitive impairment?,https://theskepticalcardiologist.com/2019/12/10/statins-and-memory-loss-the-latest-findings/," However, in treating hundreds of patients with statins, I have not observed a consistent significant effect on brain function.When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement in 2012 regarding rare postmarketing reports of ill-defined cognitive impairment associated with statin use it came as quite a surprise to most cardiologists.The FDA made a change in the patient information on all statin drugs which stated:Memory loss and confusion have been reported with statin use. These reported events were generally not serious and went away once the drug was no longer being takenThis FDA statement was surprising because prior observational and randomized controlled trials had suggested that patients who took statins were less likely to have cognitive dysfunction than those who didn’t.Early studies implied that statins might actually protect against Alzheimer’s disease.In fact these signals triggered two studies testing if statins could slow cognitive decline in patients with established Alzheimer’s disease  One study used 80 mg atorvastatin versus placebo and a second 40 mg simvastatin versus placebo and both showed no effect on the decline of cognitive function over 18 months.More recently, multiple reviews and meta-analyses have examined the data and concluded that there is no significant effect of statins on cognitive function. Importantly, these have been written by reputable physician-scientists with no financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.Data Show No Evidence of Causality Despite Case ReportsThe FDA added the warning to statin patient information based on case reports  Occasional reports of patients developing memory loss on a statin do not prove that statins are a significant cause of cognitive dysfunction.Case reports have to  be viewed in the context of all the other scientific studies indicating no consistent evidence of negative effects of the statins. Case reports are suspect for several reasons:First, patients receiving statins are at increased risk for memory loss because of associated risk factors for atherosclerosis and advancing age. A certain percentage of such patients are going to notice memory loss independent of any medications.Second. The nocebo effect: If a patient taking a statin is told that the drug will cause a particular side effect,that patient will be more likely to notice and report that particular side effect.A recent study in The Lancet looked at reported side effects in patients taking atorvastatin versus placebo and found substantial evidence for the nocebo effect.Analysis of the trial data revealed that when patients were unaware whether they were taking a statin or a placebo, the number of side effects reported was similar in those taking the statin and those taking placebo.",statins are a significant cause of cognitive dysfunction,neutral,"

Because cholesterol is heavily implicated as a causative factor in the formation of amyloid plaques, a reduction in cholesterol formation is postulated to slow plaque formation [3]. Statins are also reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. There are several studies and meta-analyses [3] confirming the benefits of statin use on cognitive impairment.Within the population receiving statins, there is a high proportion with memory loss and associated cognitive symptoms owing to the strong correlation of vascular risk factors, like diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, with vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia. Statins are used to control vascular risk factors that may contribute to dementia, and there is emerging evidence that statins may play a protective role in improving memory problems in dementia [4, 5]. However, there is also increasing concern that statins may be a causative factor for cognitive problems, mainly memory problems [2], although this has not yet been reported as a side effect in the British National Formulary.The postulation that statins can cause cognitive decline is based on the fact that lipophilic statins like atorvastatin and simvastatin show increased crossing of the blood–brain barrier compared to hydrophilic statins (for example, pravastatin and rosuvastatin).",statins can cause cognitive decline,neutral,"

 Discussion 
Several reports have documented cognitive impairment associated with the use of statins, yet most other studies have noted discordant results. Indeed, in many observational studies and clinical trials, statins were found to have a neutral or modestly beneficial effect on cognitive performance; thus, the bulk of the evidence suggests that statins do not have a clinically meaningful effect on cognition, at least for the great majority of the patients who take these drugs.

Participants underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging to identify any regions of declining cerebral metabolism within each statin group. Eight years of subject clinical data was analyzed. Patients with mild cognitive impairment or normal cognition who used lipophilic statins were found to have more than double the risk of developing dementia compared to statin non-users.

Some Statins Appear to Increase Dementia in Patients With Mild Cognitive Issues

Does the use of some of the most commonly prescribed statins significantly increase the risk of developing dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment?Research presented at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2021 Annual Meeting advises that positron emission tomography (PET) scans of lipophilic statin users revealed a highly significant decline in metabolism in the area of the brain that is first impacted by Alzheimer's disease when those cholesterol-lowering drugs were used in certain circumstances.In other words, according to the University of California at Los Angeles authors, taking lipophilic statins—which include atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and pitavastatin—appears to more than double those patients’ risk of developing dementia compared with those who do not take statins. While hydrophilic statins focus on the liver, lipophilic statins are distributed to tissues throughout the body.“There have been many conflicting studies on the effects of statin drugs on cognition,” said Prasanna Padmanabham, project head of the statins and cognition in the molecular and medical pharmacology student research program at UCLA. “While some claim that statins protect users against dementia, others assert that they accelerate the development of dementia. Our study aimed to clarify the relationship between statin use and subject’s long-term cognitive trajectory.”The study team looked at several factors:• Neuropsychological status at baseline, • Relatively high versus low serum cholesterol levels at baseline• Statin use versus nonuse • Among users, type of statin used. “The present analysis focuses upon outcomes of subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), comparing users of statins with known moderate (atorvastatin) or high (simvastatin) lipophilicity and blood-brain barrier penetrance (LS), to non-users (nonS), or users of other statins (OS),” the authors explain.Participants were enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative at over 50 North American sites. The patients were then grouped into those above (n = 103) or below (n = 200) the median cholesterol level of the nonuser subjects (206 mg/dl).Researchers report that, while serum cholesterol levels at baseline ranged widely (101-358 mg/dl), among all eMCI subjects, the average baseline cholesterol levels did not significantly differ between those who converted to dementia within 96 months as opposed to those who did not.After excluding statin users with less than 96 months of use, the below-median cholesterol group consisted of 157 patients—67 nonusers, 72 on lipophilic statins, and 18 on other statins; within that group, according to researchers, average serum levels also did not differ between those who did (166 mg/dl) and did not (171 mg/dl) convert to dementia.","

For comparison, the RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.At that time, no reliable studies had proved this to be true.But in the following few decades, multiple randomized controlled studies examined whether the vitamin had any effect on the common cold.The results have been fairly disappointing.An analysis of 29 studies including 11,306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of catching a cold (1).However, regular vitamin C supplements had several benefits, including:Reduced cold severity: They reduced the symptoms of a cold, making it less severe.Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.A supplemental dose of 1–2 grams was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18% in children, on average (1).Other studies in adults have found 6–8 grams per day to be effective (2).Vitamin C appears to have even stronger effects in people who are under intense physical stress. In marathon runners and skiers, vitamin C alantost halved the duration of the common cold (1).Summary Although vitamin C supplements have no effect on the risk of catching a cold, they appear to reduce its severity and duration.How Does Vitamin C Reduce the Severity of Colds?Vitamin C is an antioxidant and necessary to produce collagen in the skin.Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, keeping skin and various tissues tough but flexible.A vitamin C deficiency results in a condition known as scurvy, which isn’t really a problem today, as most people get enough vitamin C from foods.However, it’s less known that vitamin C is also highly concentrated in immune cells and quickly depleted during an infection (3).In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens the immune system and increases the risk of infections (4).For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during an infection is a good idea.Summary Vitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells. It is depleted during infections, so a vitamin C deficiency may increase their risk.Other Nutrients and Foods That May HelpThere is no cure for the common cold.However, some foods and nutrients can help the body recover.",HelpThere is no cure for the common cold,neutral,"

The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power.Image: Wavebreakmedia Ltd/Thinkstock Vitamin C is often touted as a natural cold remedy. The nutrient is featured in supplements promising to boost the immune system. Nobel laureate Dr. Linus Pauling famously claimed that taking large doses of vitamin C helps thwart a cold. Is there something to these claims? ""The data show that vitamin C is only marginally beneficial when it comes to the common cold,"" says Dr. Bruce Bistrian, chief of clinical nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.About vitamin COur bodies don't make vitamin C, but we need it for immune function, bone structure, iron absorption, and healthy skin.",The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power,neutral,"

Does Vitamin C prevent colds?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/," Some of the participants took the vitamin C over a period of several years.Research resultsThe studies showed that it wasn't possible to prevent colds by taking vitamin C every day over a longer period of time. But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. These results have now been confirmed by other researchers as well, especially regarding use in children. It didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women who started taking it only after they became ill.Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in connection with extremely cold temperatures. Examples include marathon runners or soldiers doing winter exercises in a mountainous region.The study participants started taking vitamin C two to three weeks before the very strenuous activities, with the aim of preventing colds.",it wasn't possible to prevent colds,no,"

Overall, experts have found little to no benefit from vitamin C for preventing or treating the common cold. In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shortened cold duration -- by 8% in adults and by 14% in children.In 2010, researchers looked at all studies and found that taking vitamin C every day did not prevent the number of colds that a person got. In some cases, it made symptoms improve.The results were different for people who were in very good physical condition, such as marathon runners.",did not prevent the number of colds,neutral,"

In a study by researchers at the University of Toronto, subjects were divided into two groups: an experimental group that received vitamin C pills at the onset of cold symptoms, and a control group that received placebo pills.

(Getty Images)There's been such enthusiastic support for some of the early findings of studies about coffee's role in weight loss that there's now a diet plan called the coffee lover's diet, which is laid out in a book of the same name by Dr. Bob Arnot, a physician and bestselling author of numerous diet and wellness books. That diet encourages drinking at least three cups of light-roast coffee per day, while restricting calories with an eating plan that looks a bit like the Mediterranean diet to lose weight.Other high-profile celebrity diet gurus have also recently pushed green coffee bean extract, a pill-based supplement, to help people lose weight. A 2017 study conducted in Iran found that women with obesity who took 400 milligrams per day of this supplement for eight weeks while following a low-calorie diet lost more weight than those on the same diet who did not take the extract. The extract comes from unroasted green coffee beans and contains caffeine and other components of coffee that may promote weight loss. The use of this supplement has been deemed a fad by some nutritionists.However, there is something to the idea that coffee and its constituent components could help support weight loss.“There have been various studies looking at the effects of coffee consumption for weight loss,” says Katherine Mitchell, an oncology dietitian at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G.

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-diet," In addition, some evidence suggests that coffee may aid weight loss (3, 4).SummaryThe coffee diet was developed by Dr. Bob Arnot, who claims that coffee can help you lose weight. On this plan, you drink at least 3 cups (720 ml) of coffee per day, replace one meal with a green smoothie, and focus on low-fat, high-fiber meals and snacks.Potential benefitsCoffee is rich in caffeine and antioxidants called polyphenols, which have several health benefits, including decreased inflammation and free radical damage (1).When it comes to boosting weight loss, coffee appears to have two potential benefits — decreasing appetite and increasing metabolism.May decrease appetiteDr. Arnot asserts that coffee can suppress your appetite, thereby helping you decrease your daily calorie intake.Some research indicates that this is true to an extent. Drinking coffee shortly before a meal may decrease how much you eat at that meal (3).However, consuming coffee 3–4.5 hours before eating appears to have no effect on how much you eat at the next meal (3).A study in 33 people who were either overweight or normal weight found that drinking coffee lowered calorie intake in those who were overweight (5).Over 3 sessions in the study, each person received breakfast and either water, regular coffee, or coffee with half the caffeine. The regular coffee contained 2.7 mg of caffeine per pound (6 mg/kg) of body weight.When those who were overweight drank 6 ounces (200 ml) of coffee, they consumed significantly fewer calories afterward, compared with when they drank water or coffee with half the caffeine (5).Conversely, one study in 12 people found there were no differences in calorie intake or appetite between those who drank caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or a placebo beverage prior to a meal (6).Caffeinated coffee may help decrease calorie intake for some people, but more research is needed before definitive claims can be made.May increase metabolismCaffeinated coffee, in particular, may increase the number of calories and amount of fat you burn, making it easier to lose weight (7).In one review that included more than 600 people, researchers found that greater caffeine intake was associated with decreased weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass.When participants’ caffeine intake doubled, their weight, BMI, and fat mass decreased by 17–28% (7).In another study, 12 adults took a supplement that contained caffeine and polyphenols — two major active components of coffee — or a placebo. The supplement caused participants to burn significantly more fat and calories than the placebo did (8).Coffee may also boost the amount of fat you burn from working out.One study looked at the effects of coffee in 7 healthy men who worked out for 30 minutes, then consumed about 1 cup (250 ml) of either water or caffeinated coffee.",some evidence suggests that coffee may aid weight loss,yes,"

At this point, there is no evidence of such long-term effects.Summary People may build up a tolerance to the effects of caffeine. For this reason, drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages may be an ineffective weight-loss strategy in the long term.The Bottom LineEven though caffeine can boost your metabolism in the short term, this effect is diminished in long-term coffee drinkers due to tolerance.If you’re primarily interested in coffee for the sake of fat loss, it may be best to cycle your coffee drinking habits to prevent a buildup of tolerance. Perhaps cycles of two weeks on, two weeks off is best.Of course, there are plenty of other great reasons to drink coffee, including the fact that coffee is one of the single largest sources of antioxidants in the Western diet.How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Current VersionMay 4, 2018Written ByKris GunnarsEdited ByElizabeth DonovanShare this articleBy Kris Gunnars, BSc on May 4, 2018Read this nextWant to Lose Weight Fast?

"
Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-water-for-weight-loss," Drinking it instead of higher-calorie beverages could help contribute to weight loss.It Can Keep You Hydrated From carrying nutrients to cells to transporting waste out of the body, drinking enough water to stay hydrated is a critical component of health.Maintaining adequate hydration is essential in everything from regulating body temperature to improving physical performance (5).Some evidence also suggests that staying hydrated can aid in weight loss.Research indicates that increased hydration may increase the breakdown of fats and enhance fat loss (6).Staying well-hydrated may also help reduce water retention, which can cause symptoms like bloating, puffiness and weight gain (7).Since the majority of lemon water is made up of water, it can help with maintaining adequate hydration.Summary: Drinking lemon water could help you stay hydrated, which reduces water retention and may increase fat loss.Drinking Lemon Water May Boost Metabolism Studies show that drinking enough water can potentially help increase your metabolism.Researchers suggest that good hydration enhances the function of mitochondria, a type of organelle found in cells that helps generate energy for the body (6).This leads to an increase in metabolism, which may lead to subsequent weight loss.Drinking water has also been shown to increase metabolism by inducing thermogenesis, a metabolic process in which calories are burned to produce heat.In one study, 14 participants drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water. Drinking water was found to increase their metabolic rate by 30% for 30–40 minutes (8).Another study looked at the effects of drinking water in 21 overweight children. Drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased metabolism by an impressive 25% for 40 minutes (9).Research on lemon water specifically is limited. However, because water is the main ingredient, it likely carries the same metabolism-boosting benefits as regular water.Summary: Studies show that drinking water could increase metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function and inducing thermogenesis.Lemon Water Can Make You Feel More Full Drinking water is often recommended as a fundamental part of any weight loss regimen, as it can promote satiety and fullness without adding calories.A 2008 study looked at the effects of water on calorie intake in 24 overweight and obese older adults.The study revealed that drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before breakfast decreased the number of calories consumed in the meal by 13% (10).Another study found that drinking water with a meal decreased hunger and increased satiety during the meal (11).Because lemon water is low in calories and can promote fullness in the same way as regular water, it can be an effective way to help reduce calorie intake.Summary: Regular water and lemon water can help promote satiety and fullness, which may decrease calorie intake and lead to weight loss.It Could Increase Weight Loss Due to its potential beneficial effects on metabolism, satiety and hydration, some evidence suggests that water (including lemon water) could enhance weight loss.In one study, 48 adults were assigned to two diets: a low-calorie diet with 16.9 oz (0.5 liters) of water prior to each meal or a low-calorie diet with no water before meals.At the end of the 12-week study, participants in the water group had lost 44% more weight than participants in the non-water group (12).Other research suggests that increasing water intake could help stimulate weight loss, independent of diet or exercise.A 2009 study measured water intake in 173 overweight women. It found that greater water intake was associated with a greater loss of body weight and fat over time, regardless of diet or physical activity (13).Though these studies focus specifically on regular water, the same results most likely apply to lemon water as well.Summary: Some studies suggest that drinking regular water or lemon water could increase weight loss, regardless of diet or exercise.Lemon Water Is Not Necessarily Better Than Regular Water Lemon water comes with a lot of potential benefits, from promoting hydration to increasing satiety.However, it’s important to note that these benefits all come from its main ingredient — water.Lemon water does contain some additional nutrients from the lemon juice, such as vitamin C and antioxidants, but these are unlikely to have any effect on your weight.Additionally, the alkalizing effect of lemon juice has no clear effects on weight.All that being said, lemon water may have some benefits for preventing kidney stones, due to the acids it contains (14, 15, 16) Summary: Lemon water may be beneficial for weight loss, but has no added benefits over regular water.How to Drink Lemon Water Lemon water is a highly customizable beverage and can be tailored based on personal preference.Recipes usually call for the juice from at least half a lemon mixed with a glass of water. To add more flavor, try adding in a few other ingredients.A few fresh mint leaves or a sprinkle of turmeric are delicious and healthy ways to spice up a glass of lemon water.Many people prefer to start their day with a refreshing glass of lemon water, but it can be enjoyed at any time of day.It can also be consumed hot, like tea, or with a few ice cubes added for a cool and invigorating drink.Despite claims that lemon water has greater benefits when consumed at certain temperatures, there is little evidence to support that it makes a difference.Summary: Lemon water can be customized based on personal preference, and it can be enjoyed hot or cold at any time of day.The Bottom Line Lemon water can promote fullness, support hydration, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.However, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to losing fat.That being said, it is tasty, easy to make and can be used as a low-calorie replacement for higher-calorie beverages.In this way, it could potentially help promote weight loss and improve health.How we reviewed this article:HistoryOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.Share this articleBy Rachael Link, MS, RD on June 11, 2017Read this nextCarbonated (Sparkling) Water: Good or Bad?By Franziska SpritzlerCarbonated (sparkling) water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas.",greater loss,neutral,"

So we put together some answers to your most-asked questions.What Are Processed Meats?AICR/WCRF’s expert report and its updates define processed meat as “meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives.” Ham, bacon, sausages, hot dogs and yes, deli meats, are all considered processed meat.How Does Processed Meat Affect Cancer Risk?The latest analysis of the global research found that eating even small amounts of cold cuts or other processed meats on a regular basis increases the risk of colorectal cancer.The report by AICR/WCRF also found that eating high amounts of red meat – over 18 ounces a week – linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer.In addition to its link to colorectal cancer, processed meat may also increase risk of heart disease.How Much Processed Meat Is Safe to Eat?Processed MeatsSausageBaconDeli meatsHot dogsHamPepperoniSalamiCorned beefResearch suggests that regularly eating even small amounts of cold cuts, bacon, sausage and hot dogs increase colorectal cancer risk, which is why AICR recommends avoiding these foods, except for special occasions.The risk continues to rise as processed meat consumption increases. Studies show that compared to eating no processed meat, eating 3.5 ounces every day – a large hot dog – increases colorectal cancer risk by 36%.Why Does Processed Meat Increase Cancer Risk?It’s not yet clear exactly why processed meats increase risk for colorectal cancer. Researchers are currently exploring a few possible mechanisms, including:Nitrates/Nitrites: These are added to processed meats to preserve color and prevent spoilage. In lab studies, these compounds form cancer-causing compounds, carcinogens.Smoking: Smoked meats contain PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons), substances that are formed at high-heat and considered carcinogenic.Cooking at high temperatures: Meats cooked at high temperatures can also contain PAHs and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which can damage DNA.Heme iron: The heme iron found in red meat may damage the lining of the colon.What about nitrate/nitrite-free turkey or other deli meats?These products are relatively new.

And the sort of harm you can come to from slipping on a banana skin isn’t generally as severe as, say, being in a car accident.But under a hazard identification system like IARC’s, ‘banana skins’ and ‘cars’ would come under the same category – they both definitely do cause accidents.To put things in perspective, let’s look at how processed meat stacks up against smoking.Copy this link and share our graphic. Credit: Cancer Research UK How does processed and red meat cause cancer?So far, research has linked 3 chemicals to increased bowel cancer risk. These chemicals are either naturally found in meat, added during processing or produced when cooking:haem (a red pigment found mostly in red meat);nitrates and nitrites (used to keep processed meat fresher for longer); andheterocyclic amines and polycyclic amines (produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures)All 3 can damage the cells in our bowel, and it’s the accumulation of this damage over time that increases cancer risk.How much matters?The latest study analysed data from half a million UK adults over almost 7 years and found that moderate processed and red meat eaters – those eating 79g per day on average – had a 32% increased risk of bowel cancer compared to people eating less than 11g of red and processed meat daily.To put this in context, for every 10,000 people on the study who ate less than 11 grams of red and processed meat a day, 45 were diagnosed with bowel cancer. Eating 79 grams of red and processed meat a day caused 14 extra cases of bowel cancer per 10,000 people. These figures are just for the independent effect of meat consumption, as they take into account other differences between these groups of people, for example sex, deprivation, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, other aspects of diet, reproductive factors, and body mass index.Professor Tim Key, who co-led the recent study and is deputy director at the University of Oxford’s cancer epidemiology unit, says that while the impact of cutting back on processed meat might be smaller than quitting smoking, it’s still important.“Everyone eats and everyone is at risk of colorectal cancer,” he says.",32%,neutral,"

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-nitrates," While they are often associated with cured meats, green, leafy vegetables are actually much richer in nitrates.While the association of nitrate with cured meats causes some to worry about their cancer-causing effects, other studies show that the nitrates found in vegetables may actually help reduce the risk of cancer. Studies suggest that eating foods rich in natural nitrates can help reduce your risk of a number of chronic health conditions, whereas eating foods high in added nitrates can cause health risks.Why You Should Avoid NitratesNitrates on their own are not broken down by stomach acid. Instead, your gut biome can break down nitrate into nitrite, which can cause health complications such as an increased risk of cancer. Nitrate is an inorganic, water-soluble chemical. Your body makes around 62 milligrams (mg) of nitrites a day, but the majority of nitrates come from your diet.

BMMF are active in human cells, and replicate and produce proteins.Current data supports that BMMF enter and infect humans in the very early age and further accumulate in immune cells of the colon, which orchestrate the defence against infections. Long-term consumption may result in chronic inflammation in the colon, damaging the cells that may develop into tumour precursors. This causes an elevated risk for the development of colon cancer commonly 40–70 years after first infection with BMMF.Aims and objectivesAlthough we know that BMMF intake can cause chronic inflammation, and thus cancer, we do not know how BMMF enter and persist in cells, which changes are induced and how we could prevent it.

Grapefruit oil and medication by Hana Tisserand


Doctors warn against consuming Grapefruit juice if you take certain types of medication, such as statins, which are metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Grapefruit juice inhibits this enzyme so the liver produces less of it, and this affects the action of those drugs – they will be less effective. This is known as a drug interaction. Should you also be careful when using the essential oil? Grapefruit juice interaction is primarily due to dihydroxybergamottin, which is not present in the essential oil.",Grapefruit juice inhibits this enzyme,neutral,"

This happens because grapefruit juice can also interfere with drug transporters, which are proteins that help our bodies absorb the drugs by moving them to the cells. What kinds of medication negatively interact with grapefruit? Grapefruit doesn’t interact with just every type of medication out there.

People living with diabetes are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (29, 30, 31, 32). Unlike refined sugar products such as candy and cake, the carbs in fruits like bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (33).For most people with diabetes, fruits — including bananas — are a healthy choice.However, some people who are following low carb diets need to watch their total carbohydrate intake to stay within their daily carb allotment. This means foods higher in carbs, including bananas, have to be limited on low carb diets.If your doctor says you can eat bananas, it’s important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of a banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.SummaryFruits like bananas are healthy foods that contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Depending on a person’s meal plan and nutritional needs, a doctor or dietitian may recommend swapping out carbs in a later meal.Alternatively, after eating a meal that is lighter on carbs, a person can enjoy a small banana as a snack to balance their carb intake.Do bananas raise blood pressure?Bananas are rich in potassium, an important micronutrient that can support healthy blood pressure levels.In fact, one study found that frequent consumption of several types of fruit, including bananas, was linked to lower blood pressure levels.Furthermore, some research suggests that a potassium-rich diet could reduce the risk of stroke — a condition that is often the result of high blood pressure — by around 25%. NutritionOverall, bananas are nutrient-dense, low in saturated fat and sodium, and rich in fiber.They are also a key source of potassium, a mineral that helps balance sodium levels in the blood.Bananas provide a good mix of other nutrients, including:vitamin B6manganesemagnesiumvitamin CWho should avoid bananas?Individuals with diabetes can enjoy bananas and other fruits in moderation as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.However, a person should be sure to consult a doctor or dietitian before making any changes to their diet plan, especially if they are taking medications for diabetes or other health conditions.For instance, certain medications used to treat high blood pressure can increase levels of potassium in the blood, which could cause negative side effects if paired with a high potassium diet.Additionally, people with chronic kidney disease may need to limit their intake of potassium-rich foods such as bananas to prevent an increase in blood potassium levels.TakeawayA person with diabetes should include a variety of fresh, whole foods in their diet, such as nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables.Bananas are a safe and nutritious fruit for people with diabetes to eat in moderation as part of a balanced, individualized eating plan.For a more precise diet plan or personalized recommendations, it is a good idea to consult a registered dietitian or diabetes specialist.Q:I know bananas contain a lot of potassium. Does this help reduce the effects of diabetes?A:Potassium is an important nutrient for many processes in the body, such as regulating nerve signals, balancing fluid levels, and supporting muscle contraction.Potassium can be helpful in decreasing complications from diabetes and managing comorbidities, including high blood pressure.It is an important nutrient for decreasing cardiovascular risks, which are often present in those with poorly managed diabetes.

Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.bensnaturalhealth.com/blog/diabetes-health/bananas-and-diabetes/," Many questions arise when considering the relationship between bananas and diabetes. Bananas, among many other types of fruit, are a good option for people with diabetes. Fruit isn’t “bad” for people with diabetes just because it raises blood sugar. Like any food that raises blood sugar, the more important thing is to be mindful of portion size and focusing on an overall balanced diet to promote healthy blood sugar levels for those with diabetes. Eating too much of any food, even healthy food like fruit, can become detrimental to health and diabetes management. Focusing on balanced meals and snacks is more important than singling out a single food.",raises blood sugar,neutral,"

Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-answers/diabetes/faq-20057835," Answer From M. Regina Castro, M.D. It's a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat certain foods because they're ""too sweet."" Some fruits do contain more sugar than others, but that doesn't mean you can't eat them if you have diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates in a food affects blood sugar levels more than the source of the carbohydrates — or whether that carbohydrate source is a starch or sugar. As you decide what fruit to eat, keep in mind that one serving of fruit should contain no more than 15 grams of carbohydrates. So the size of the serving depends on how much carbohydrates are in the fruit.",Some fruits do contain more sugar than others,neutral,"

Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?,https://diabetesmealplans.com/12715/bananas-for-diabetes/," Just 3.1 grams of fiber is not going to make up for nearly 17 grams of carbs (all coming from simple sugars). So, the short of it is: unfortunately, bananas won’t be making the list of diabetes friendly foods anytime soon. As a person with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, your main interest in any food should be whether or not it’s loaded with quick sugars and carbohydrates, as these things promote higher fluctuations in your blood sugar and A1c levels. Right after a high carb meal you might feel sluggish, moody, and have a hard time concentrating, but that’s not the worst of it. In the long run, a history of higher-than-normal blood sugar (indicated by an elevated A1C level or daily high blood sugar readings) can result in a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and other diabetic complications like neuropathy and vision loss – sorry for the doom and gloom but being aware of the consequences of prolonged high blood glucose is very important.

WiFi operates in the 2 to 5 GHz range -- part of the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is in the same part of the spectrum where cell phones operate so I may refer to WiFi or cellphone electromagnetic radiation interchangeably. These are radio waves -- no different from those used to broadcast television programs, except that they are higher in frequency. They aren't nearly as high a frequency as visible light, and no one worries about getting cancer from visible light (ultraviolet light, on the other hand, causes skin cancer, but this is the minimum energy necessary to cause ionizations that can cause breaks in strands of DNA, which is the mechanism by which cancer cells can be created).

 There are many articles on the Internet suggesting that a Wi-Fi router poses potential health risks while others negate it. Scientists and researchers are still studying the effects of long-term electromagnetic radiation. Some experts say that wireless routers and allied systems produce radiation in low GHz frequency, which is potentially dangerous even when it is within the so-called ‘safe limits’ set by some countries. As the RF radiations could still cause harmful or non-thermal biological problems, we should understand the risks associated with Wi-Fi radiation from our own routers and those installed by our neighbours, offices, or even in public places. vias next to a pad, in some cases even by removing some pads from the BGA footprint.",poses potential health risks,neutral,"

There is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio signals from wi-fi and WLANs adversely affects the health of the general population. The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point), and the results so far show exposures are well within the internationally-accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency (RF) exposures from wi-fi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones.

Basically, WiFi uses radio waves to transmit data, and these radio waves are a form of Electromagnetic Radiation known as Radio Frequency, or RF, radiation. Any type of EMF radiation, including RF radiation, has been shown to have harmful effects on the body, especially in large doses over long periods of time. This is the reason that the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the World Health Organization labeled RF radiation (just like WiFi) a “Group 2B possible carcinogen based on the increased risk for glioma, a type of brain cancer associated with wireless phone use.”

This may naturally lead to lower calorie intake. However, it could worsen gastroparesis for some.It may help you lose weight and body fatResults from a small but widely cited 2009 study indicate that apple cider vinegar has impressive effects on weight and body fat (7).In this 12-week study, 144 Japanese adults with obesity consumed either 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vinegar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, or a placebo drink every day.They were told to restrict their alcohol intake but otherwise continue their usual diet and activity throughout the study.Participants who consumed 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day had — on average — the following benefits:Weight loss: 2.6 pounds (lb), or 1.2 kilograms (kg)Decrease in body fat percentage: 18%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.5 inches (in), or 1.4 centimeters (cm)Decrease in triglycerides: 26%This is what changed in participants who consumed 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day:Weight loss: 4.2 lb, or 1.7 kgDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in, or 1.9 cmDecrease in triglycerides: 26%The placebo group actually gained 0.9 lb (0.4 kg), and their waist circumference slightly increased.In a 2018 clinical trial involving 39 participants on restricted calorie diets, those who consumed about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar (8).According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your body fat percentage, help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood triglycerides.These are two of only a few human studies that have investigated apple cider vinegar’s effects on weight loss. Although the results are encouraging, additional studies are needed.SummaryIn two studies, people with obesity who took 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost weight and body fat.Other health benefitsIn addition to promoting weight and fat loss, apple cider vinegar has several other benefits:Lowers blood sugar and insulin: When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating (4).Improves insulin sensitivity: Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal may improve insulin sensitivity (9).Lowers fasting blood sugar: Studies have found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (10).Improves polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms: In a small 2013 study of women with PCOS who took vinegar for 90–110 days, 57% resumed ovulation, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity (11).Decreases cholesterol levels: A 2021 research review of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides (12).Lowers blood pressure: Animal studies suggest that vinegar may decrease blood pressure by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for constricting blood vessels. However, human studies haven’t shown significant decreases in blood pressure (13, 14).Kills harmful bacteria and viruses: Studies show that apple cider vinegar may be a powerful fighter against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria as well as resistant Escherichia coli (rE.",may help you lose weight,neutral,"

Nonetheless, these studies do show some possible benefits of apple cider vinegar and could open the door to further research.Body fat reductionShare on PinterestApple cider vinegar is a popular natural health treatment, and is thought to aid weight loss.Acetic acid, a compound found in apple cider vinegar, has been cited in some studies as the active ingredient that helps with weight loss.A study in Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry found that mice who were given acetic acid were less likely to gain body fat.The mice that were given the acetic acid had higher energy expenditure, oxygen intake, and burned more fat for energy than those given just water. The authors state that this suggests acetic acid could help suppress body fat buildup.A similar article in the same journal found that consuming vinegar did help reduce body fat, though the reduction was small. This study used 155 people who were considered obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 25–30.Over 12 weeks, three groups were given either 15 milliliters (ml) of vinegar, 30 ml of vinegar, or a placebo.

Apple cider vinegar has been shown to be most effective when paired with a diet full of starchy foods, as the acid slows down the digestion of starch.

This can lead to eating fewer calories and losing weight.For example, according to one study, taking vinegar along with a high carb meal led to increased feelings of fullness, causing participants to eat 200–275 fewer calories throughout the rest of the day (13, 14).Furthermore, a study in 175 people with obesity showed that daily apple cider vinegar consumption led to reduced belly fat and weight loss (15):taking 1 tablespoon (15 mL) led to a loss of 2.6 pounds (1.2 kg)taking 2 tablespoons (30 mL) led to a loss of 3.7 pounds (1.7 kg)However, keep in mind that this study went on for 3 months, so the true effects on body weight seem to be rather modest.That said, simply adding or subtracting single foods or ingredients rarely has a noticeable effect on weight.

Question: Is ginger really good for nausea or is this an old wives' tale?Answer: Ginger is an underground stem that is beige, thick and knotted. The stem extends roughly a foot above ground with long, narrow, ribbed, green leaves, and white or yellowish-green flowers.The underground stems of the ginger plant are used for cooking and medicinal purposes. In Asia, ginger is used to treat stomach aches, nausea, and diarrhea. Ginger extract is found in many dietary supplements sold in the United States for digestive ailments. Common forms of ginger include fresh or dried root, tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, tincture and tea.The following are summaries of evidence from the National Institutes of Health about treatment of a variety of ailments with ginger:Motion sickness: Some studies report that ginger has no effect on motion sickness, and other studies say that ginger may reduce vomiting, but not nausea.",Is ginger really good for nausea,neutral,"

While ginger root has long been linked to nausea relief, most ginger ale contains very little of it. Thus, ginger ale is unlikely to relieve nausea.Potential downsides to drinking ginger aleSome home remedies for nausea call for drinking ginger ale at room temperature, while others require drinking it flat.

The caveat, he says, is that we still don’t really understand why nausea happens in the first place. It's likely that various mechanisms within the human body contribute to nausea, according to Rezaie, many of which we don’t quite understand yet. This makes it hard to pinpoint if and how ginger might help combat it.“You can't necessarily treat every single nausea with similar treatment,” he says. The nausea that he says ginger most effectively tamps down is mild to moderate morning sickness.However, when it comes to seasickness or motion sickness, Rezaie says over-the-counter or prescription medications will probably work better.",mitigates nausea,neutral,"

This article looks at which foods can help relieve nausea.GingerPeople have traditionally used ginger to treat nausea. Gingerols and shogaols are components in ginger that may stimulate the stomach to empty and help to relieve feelings of nausea.A review of studies looked at the effects of ginger on nausea and vomiting in cases of pregnancy-induced symptoms. Four randomized controlled trials showed that ginger was more effective than a placebo in reducing the intensity of nausea and frequency of vomiting in pregnant females.The authors of the review also found that ginger was more effective than a placebo in treating morning sickness, seasickness, and chemotherapy-induced nausea.Another study supports that ginger may help relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea. The study found that 500 milligrams of powdered ginger root 2 times per day, 5 days before and 5 days after chemotherapy, helped reduce the frequency of vomiting in breast cancer patients.

      This article identified nine studies and seven reviews that investigated ginger for morning sickness, postoperative nausea and vomiting, chemotherapy-induced, and antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting. All studies reported that ginger provided a significant reduction in nausea and vomiting; however, the clinical relevance of some studies is less certain. Common limitations within the literature include the lack of standardized extracts, poorly controlled or blinded studies, and limited sample size. In addition, recent evidence has provided further support for 5-HT3 receptor antagonism as a mechanism by which ginger may exert its potentially beneficial effect on nausea and vomiting. Summary:
        
      
      The results of studies in this article suggest that ginger is a promising treatment for nausea and vomiting in a variety of clinical settings and possesses a clinically relevant mechanism.
