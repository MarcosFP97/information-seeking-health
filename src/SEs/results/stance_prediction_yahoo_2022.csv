Using a tea bag may help reduce bleeding. If you notice a small amount of bleeding an hour after extraction, place a moist tea bag on the extraction site and bite down tightly to apply pressure to the area. Do so for about 20 to 30 minutes. Drinking cold tea may also be helpful, but applying a tea bag directly to the area gives better results. [3]

If bleeding persists, a slightly moistened black tea bag can be a very effective substitute for the gauze (following the same instructions given for the gauze placement). One of the ingredients of regular black tea is tannic acid, and tannic acid aids in the formation of blood clots. It is both the application of firm pressure and maintaining this pressure that are important factors in controlling the initial bleeding after an extraction, although slight bleeding or oozing may occur several days after surgery.

Can crystals heal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/healing-crystals-what-they-can-do-and-what-they-cant," One common belief is that crystals interact with the body’s energy fields, also known as vibrational energy. The idea is that crystals can redirect and re-channel energy flow with their unique energetic vibrations, helping to unblock areas of the body or energy field that have become “stuck.”“Crystals have potent healing powers, and when we touch them, healing is immediately activated,” says cosmic energy healer Eva Antoniadou. As the crystal vibrations interact with the body’s natural energetic frequency, the body is said to be left feeling focused, relaxed, and clear. “Crystals absorb energy from pressure and movement and convert it into an electronic frequency,” says Polack. “It’s this frequency, unique to each type of crystal, that users are relying on when working with crystals, and given that many pain and anxiety relief devices work on similar principles, we do believe they can help in these areas.”Methods of treating pain and other disorders with electrical current include:radiofrequency ablation (RFA)electronic muscle stimulation (EMS)transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Compared to these therapies, any frequency a crystal might emit would be infinitesimal.

However, in the end, healing crystals really are just pretty rocks. There is no scientific evidence to show that crystals can actually heal various maladies and traditional doctors wouldn’t try to cure a disease by sending a patient home with a prescription for crystals.",There is no scientific evidence to show that crystals can actually heal various maladies,neutral,"

Can crystals heal?,https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a26559820/healing-crystals/," According to Avila, ancient Egyptians used crystals for healing and protection; sacred Indian texts explain specific healing properties of various crystals and how to use them to treat illnesses; Chinese medicine often includes the use of crystals; and ancient Greeks and Romans used crystals for protection in battle and in medical treatment—just to name a few examples.So perhaps it’s not so far-fetched that in modern days, we're turning to the potential healing powers of crystals and stones. Or is it? First, what do healing crystals do?“There’s no scientific research that backs up the claim that crystals can be used to cure disease,” says Navya Mysore, MD, a primary care physician and medical director of One Medical. Because illnesses are not caused by negative energy or wavelengths, crystals technically can’t cure disease in the way that crystal proponents explain, she says.

Scientists are investigating whether it can also help treat osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease worldwide, a degenerative disease that affects 10% of men and 18% of women over 60. Apart from trying to exercise and taking various painkillers, there is little that doctors can recommend and, aside from joint replacement surgery, there are no cures.Studies have suggested that just as with athletes, hydrolysed collagen may help regenerate the damaged joints. One trial of 120 people in 2018 found that a proportion of those taking collagen saw significant improvements in joint pain and mobility. Norwegian company Hofseth BioCare is running its own trial investigating whether various forms of collagen can help people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis.“Treatment advances for osteoarthritis are lagging behind those for many other musculoskeletal and chronic diseases,” says Crawford Currie, head of R&D at Hofseth BioCare. “Why and how collagen seems to work has not been completely elucidated yet, but our intention is to eventually offer dietary supplementation solutions that are easily available, low-cost, safe and which will have a meaningful effect on quality of life.”For while the popular perception of collagen has long been linked to its uses in the cosmetic industry, these developments could help rethink the way we perceive this remarkable protein and perhaps find even more uses for it across the healthcare world.TopicsMedical researchThe ObserverBeautyHealthSports injuriesAgeingfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesTravelHealth & fitnessWomenMenLove & sexBeautyHome & gardenMoneyCarsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.",Scientists are investigating whether it can also help treat osteoarthritis,neutral,"

Supplementing with the protein may help preserve skin health, muscle mass, bones, and joints.Types of collagenCollagen is an abundant protein, with 28 types having been identified to date.Types I, II, III, IV, and V are the most common in the human body (3, 23).It’s believed that the various types of collagen serve unique purposes. For example, older research has identified that types I and III present together in the organs and skin, while type II is typically found in joints and cartilage (24, 25).As such, different types of collagen are typically advertised as part of collagen supplements.Nonetheless, keep in mind that more research is needed to better understand how the various types of collagen in supplement form may influence human health.Forms used in supplementsSimilarly to how your body contains different types of this protein, so do many collagen supplements.The most used types include (3, 26, 27, 28):Hydrolyzed collagen (collagen hydrolysate). This type is derived from bovine (cattle), marine (seafood), poultry (often chicken or eggshells), pigs, and other animal sources, and it’s broken down into smaller and easier-to-absorb peptide particles.Undenatured collagen. This is raw collagen derived from chicken cartilage.Gelatin: This is cooked collagen, usually derived from animal sources.The type used in your supplement of choice could influence the supplement form and its dosage instructions.Note that there aren’t any vegan substitutes for collagen. Supplements may be free of dairy, gluten, or sugar, but collagen is only available from animal sources.SUMMARYThe most common types of collagen used in supplements are hydrolyzed collagen, undenatured collagen, and gelatin.Proper dosageCurrently, health authorities haven’t provided any official guidelines regarding how much collagen to take per day.Thus, the amount of collagen you should take depends on which form you’re taking and why you’re taking it.Hydrolyzed collagenHydrolyzed collagen is one of the most common forms used in supplements, as it’s absorbed more readily than other types.",joint pain,neutral,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet," Why has there been concern that cell phones may cause cancer? There are two main reasons why people are concerned that cell (or mobile) phones might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems: Cell phones emit radiation (in the form of radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves), and cell phone use is widespread. Even a small increase in cancer risk from cell phones would be of concern given how many people use them. Brain and central nervous system cancers have been of particular concern because hand-held phones are used close to the head and because ionizing radiation—a higher energy form of radiation than what cell phones emit—has been found to cause some brain cancers. Many different kinds of studies have been carried out to try to investigate whether cell phone use is dangerous to human health. However, the evidence to date suggests that cell phone use does not cause brain or other kinds of cancer in humans.",Cell phones emit radiation,neutral,"

The bottom line is that no one can say for sure right now whether there's a link between cell phones and cancer. Decades of studies have led to conflicting results. And scientists are still studying the issue.But if you're concerned, there are steps you can take to reduce how much radiation you're exposed to from your cell phone. That radiation is what might link cell phones to cancer.Radiation From Cell PhonesCell phones give off small amounts of a type of radiation called radiofrequency radiation, or radio waves. It's called non-ionizing radiation, and it's the same type you find in FM radio waves and microwaves.It’s different from ionizing radiation, which comes from things like X-rays and ultraviolet light.",no one can say for sure,neutral,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html," Because cell phones usually are held near the head when a person is on a call, the main concern has been whether the phones might cause or contribute to tumors in this area, including:

Malignant (cancerous) brain tumors, such as gliomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the brain, such as meningiomas
Non-cancerous tumors of the nerve connecting the brain to the ear (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas)
Tumors of the salivary glands

A few studies have also looked at possible links to other types of cancer. What do studies show? Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to determine if something might cause cancer:

Studies done in the lab (using lab animals or cell cultures)
Studies looking at groups of people

In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own to show if something causes cancer in people, so researchers usually look at both lab-based and human studies. The following is a brief summary of some of the major studies that have looked at this issue to date.

Ever since, the question of whether cell phones cause cancer has buzzed quietly in the background as the technology has become omnipresent in our lives.Numerous studies of cell phone radiation and cancer have been conducted over the years to address the issue, but none has been definitive.To obtain more solid evidence, a team of scientists at the National Toxicology Program, a division of the National Institutes of Health, undertook an in-depth study. Their approach was to expose laboratory rodents to high doses of cell phone radiation over their entire life span and see if they developed cancer as a result. The study cost $20 million and took more than ten years to complete. Final results were released to the public in November 2018.

NTP scientists had exposed thousands of rats and mice (whose biological similarities to humans make them useful indicators of human health risks) to doses of radiation equivalent to an average mobile user’s lifetime exposure.The peer review scientists repeatedly upgraded the confidence levels the NTP’s scientists and staff had attached to the study, fuelling critics’ suspicions that the NTP’s leadership had tried to downplay the findings. Thus the peer review also found “some evidence” – one step below “clear evidence” – of cancer in the brain and adrenal glands.Not one major news organisation in the US or Europe reported this scientific news. But then, news coverage of mobile phone safety has long reflected the outlook of the wireless industry. For a quarter of a century now, the industry has been orchestrating a global PR campaign aimed at misleading not only journalists, but also consumers and policymakers about the actual science concerning mobile phone radiation. Indeed, big wireless has borrowed the very same strategy and tactics big tobacco and big oil pioneered to deceive the public about the risks of smoking and climate change, respectively.",radiation from mobile phones causes cancer,yes,"

Can cell phones cause cancer?,https://www.acsh.org/news/2021/08/09/do-cell-phones-cause-cancer-15721," It is not like ionizing, high-energy radiation from X-rays, penetrating tissue more deeply and breaking DNA bonds. Despite the lack of a direct means of causing cell mutation, there has been a recurring concern about cellphones causing cancer – specifically those in the head and neck, the places we most commonly hold cellphones. If these wireless devices cause cancers, why have decades of studies demonstrated stable rates of brain tumors among adults and children while cellphone use has exploded exponentially? As you might expect, the answer is both complicated and uncertain. Dr. Geoffrey Kabat, a cancer epidemiologist, has written in the past that

There are some indications of an increased risk of glioma for those who reported the highest 10% of cumulative hours of cell phone use, although there was no consistent trend of increasing risk with greater duration of use. The researchers concluded that biases and errors limit the strength of these conclusions and prevent a causal interpretation.Based largely on these data, IARC has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence.While an increased risk of brain tumors is not established, the increasing use of mobile phones and the lack of data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than 15 years warrant further research of mobile phone use and brain cancer risk. In particular, with the recent popularity of mobile phone use among younger people, and therefore a potentially longer lifetime of exposure, WHO has promoted further research on this group.

For a small number of people with the virus, a serious illness develops in the nervous system.Zika virus: This is a generally mild condition that initially causes fever, joint pain, and rash. The initial symptoms of Zika usually pass after 1 week, but the disease can lead to congenital anomalies if a woman becomes pregnant after receiving a mosquito bite.Yellow fever: This virus causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.

Mild headaches: Having a mild headache is considered a moderate reaction to a mosquito bite, normally appearing in those who have a weakened immune system. You can experience slight pain or tension, but it is not usually persistent and can be relieved used conventional painkillers or home solutions. If your headache intensifies or is prolonged, it might be a sign of a more serious illness and you should consult your doctor as soon as possible


Low fever: A mild or low fever is a symptom that can sometimes occur, normally when the immune system is struggling to fight off an invasive pathogen. You might find that your temperature is slightly, but not alarmingly, higher than usual. This symptom should begin to diminish within a few days but if it persists or worsens, you should speak to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a more serious, mosquito-borne illness.

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics," But a genetic change that increases the risk of cancer can be passed down (inherited) if it is present in a parent's egg or sperm cells. For example, if a parent passes a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene to their child, the child will have a much higher risk of developing breast and several other cancers. That’s why cancer sometimes appears to run in families. Up to 10% of all cancers may be caused by inherited genetic changes.

Although these cancers are often referred to as inherited cancers, what is actually inherited is the abnormal gene that can lead to cancer, not the cancer itself. Only about 5% to 10% of all cancers are known to be strongly linked to gene defects (called mutations) inherited from a parent. To learn about the role of genes and how mutations can lead to cancer, see Genes and Cancer. How do you recognize an inherited or family cancer syndrome? Certain things make it more likely that cancers in a family are caused by a family cancer syndrome, such as:

Many cases of the same type of cancer (especially if it is an uncommon or rare type of cancer)
Cancers occurring at younger ages than usual (like colon cancer in a 20-year-old)
More than one type of cancer in a single person (like a woman with both breast and ovarian cancer)
Cancers occurring in both of a pair of organs (like both eyes, both kidneys, or both breasts)
More than one childhood cancer in siblings (like sarcoma in both a brother and a sister)

Can cancer be inherited?,https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia-hereditary," Some examples of hereditary diseases include hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophies. It’s rare for these types of hereditary diseases to suddenly appear in someone with no family history of them.There are some types of hereditary cancers, as well. For example, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancers have hereditary elements that may put families at risk. What are the genetic and environmental risk factors for leukemia?Understanding riskA risk factor is some element about you, your genetics, or your environment that can make you more likely to develop a disease. Disease risk factors aren’t the same thing as disease causes.

For example, a shared environment or lifestyle, such as tobacco use, can cause similar cancers to develop among family members. However, certain patterns that are seen in members of a family—such as the types of cancer that develop, other non-cancer conditions that are seen, and the ages at which cancer typically develops—may suggest the presence of an inherited susceptibility to cancer. Genes involved in many of the known inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes have been identified. Testing whether someone carries a harmful variant in one of these genes can confirm whether a condition is, indeed, the result of an inherited syndrome. Genetic testing is also done to determine whether family members who have not (yet) developed a cancer have inherited the same variant as a family member who is known to carry a harmful (cancer susceptibility predisposing) variant.",may suggest the presence of an inherited susceptibility to cancer,yes,"

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are serious multisystem developmental disorders and an urgent global public health concern. Dysfunctional immunity and impaired brain function are core deficits in ASD. Aluminum (Al), the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, is a demonstrated neurotoxin and a strong immune stimulator. Hence, adjuvant Al has the potential to induce neuroimmune disorders. When assessing adjuvant toxicity in children, two key points ought to be considered: (i) children should not be viewed as ""small adults"" as their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to toxic insults; and (ii) if exposure to Al from only few vaccines can lead to cognitive impairment and autoimmunity in adults, is it unreasonable to question whether the current pediatric schedules, often containing 18 Al adjuvanted vaccines, are safe for children? By applying Hill's criteria for establishing causality between exposure and outcome we investigated whether exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence in the Western world.",exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence,yes,"

First, there is the unfortunate coincidence that warning signs of autism—not responding to their name, not babbling, little eye contact—often become obvious around the same time that infants get a hefty round of vaccinations, especially around their first birthday. The timing makes the link (although illusory) seem very real. Fear is also a powerful motivator.",there is absolutely no scientific evidence that vaccinations cause autism,neutral,"

William Thompson, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and one of the authors of a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics, spoke with Brain Hooker, who serves on the board of Focus Autism (which was founded to “put an end to the needless harm of children by vaccination and other environmental factors”), about the data that was not included in the final report. The study looked at both healthy children and those with autism, to see if there were any differences in their rates of being vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), and found none. That suggested that childhood immunizations likely were not contributing to an increased risk of autism.",not linked with an increased risk of the developmental disorder,no,"

Autism





Claims that vaccines cause autism have led some parents to delay or refuse vaccines for their children. The most common claims are that autism is caused by MMR vaccine, vaccines that contain thimerosal, or too many vaccines. Many 
        scientific studies have been done to test these claims. None has shown 
        any correlation between vaccines and autism. Autism Resources

Can baking soda help to cure cancer?,https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/baking-soda," The findings are complicated.There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer. It’s important to remember that cancer grows quite well in healthy tissue with normal pH levels. Additionally, naturally acidic environments, like the stomach, don’t encourage cancer growth.Once cancer cells begin to grow, they produce an acidic environment that encourages malignant growth. The goal of many researchers is to decrease the acidity of that environment so that the cancer cells aren’t able to thrive.A 2009 study published in Cancer Research found that injecting bicarbonate into mice reduced tumor pH levels and slowed the progression of metastatic breast cancer.The acidic microenvironment of tumors may be related to chemotherapeutic failure in cancer treatment. Cancer cells are difficult to target because the area around them is acidic, though they’re alkaline. Many cancer drugs have trouble passing through these layers.Several studies have evaluated the use of antacid drugs in combination with chemotherapy.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed for the treatment of acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).",There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that baking soda can prevent cancer,neutral,"

Chances are you’ve used baking soda to cook, freshen up your refrigerator and brighten your smile, but a study published in the journal Cell says this cheap, simple substance may help chemotherapy attack cancer. Chemotherapy works by destroying actively growing cells, but tumors often cut off the oxygen supply of cells inside of them. This causes the cells to shut down, making it difficult for chemotherapy to work. Scientists at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Moffitt Cancer Center looked at breast and colon cancers in mice and saw an increase in cell activity after giving the mice water mixed with baking soda, also known as bicarbonate soda.","cheap, simple substance may help chemotherapy attack cancer",neutral,"

Sodium Bicarbonate and Cancer 






















Over two decades ago, an oncologist based in Rome named Dr. Tullio Simoncini proposed the idea that cancer is a fungus and that sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda (one of the most powerful anti-fungal substances) can effectively treat cancer. Simoncini presented his idea with supporting documentation to the Italian Department of Health. His theory was ignored, and Dr. Simoncini was scorned as a doctor for having such an abstract idea and using an unproven treatment on his patients. Dr. Simoncini strongly believed,  and his patients were proof, that sodium bicarbonate treatments worked. With minimal side effects and very low risk, this treatment was quick, effective, and has worked for people with many different types of cancer.",Sodium Bicarbonate,neutral,"

A new study has found that baking soda could make cancer treatments more effective at fighting drug-resistant tumors. The findings, which appear in the journal Cell, are based on researchers’ discovery that acidic conditions can cause cancer cells to go dormant, allowing them to hide from treatment. “Many of the therapies we have — chemotherapy, targeted therapy — work in cells that are actively functioning and dividing,” said lead author Chi Dang. “When you awaken cells from a resting state into an active state, they become more vulnerable to cancer therapy.”
Researchers began by looking at hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, which scientists have long connected with drug resistance. Recent studies have theorized that a special protein resulting from hypoxia could be blocking cell division, leading to dormancy.

Both strengthening and aerobic exercise can reduce pain and improve function in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis, with few contraindications, and are essential in the management of osteoarthritis. Improvements in strength and proprioception gained from exercise may reduce the progression of osteoarthritis, although adherence is the principle predictor of long-term outcome from exercise.

   Tweak Your Form  

If a squat exercise is causing you knee pain, it could be due to improper posture and form. Making a few small changes while squatting can actually prevent knee pain and protect your joints from more serious injuries, like sprains or tendonitis. Squatting with incorrect posture can cause strains, Dr. Enad says. To avoid these injuries, he suggests not to hunch too far forward during a squat or to stand too stiff, which can cause pain. ""Focus on squatting movements where the hips shift back rather than straight down,"" says professional strength and conditioning coach Jerry Handley, owner and head coach at Viking Performance Training. Dr. Enad adds that ""good form should feel like you're going to sit down into a chair behind you, leading with your buttocks, but staying well-balanced with good posture.""",it could be due to improper posture and form,neutral,"

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-blood-pressure-and-erectile-dysfunction-5201662," It also means that it can help promote blood flow to certain areas of the body like the penis. ACE inhibitors also reduce the workload of the heart which can increase stamina and sexual performance. Common ACE inhibitors taken for high blood pressure include:



EnalaprilLisinoprilPerindoprilRamiprilCaptoprilBenazepril



An ACE inhibitor like lisinopril is unlikely to result in ED because the drug increases blood flow. In one study, less than 3% men taking lisinopril reported ED as a side effect. Vasodilators and Erectile Dysfunction  

Arterial vasodilators relax blood vessels and improve blood flow, which helps to lower blood pressure. Some common arterial vasodilators taken for high blood pressure include: 



Benazepril (lotensin)Captopril (capoten)Enalapril (vasotec, epaned)Fosinopril (monopril)Lisinopril (prinivil, zestril)Moexipril (univasc)Perindopril (aceon)Quinapril (accupril)Ramipril (altace)Trandolapril (mavik)

Do ACE inhibitors typically cause erectile dysfunction?,https://rexmd.com/learn/does-lisinopril-cause-erectile-dysfunction," The researchers attribute the initial decline in sexual interaction to the psychological effects of hypertension diagnosis and first treatment, and conclude that the ""low incidence of sexual dysfunction with ACE inhibitors [is] probably due to the fact that these drugs work through channels other than the sympathetic nervous system in lowering [blood pressure]."" What Does Cause Erectile Dysfunction? While it seems that the connection between lisinopril, ACE inhibitors, and erectile dysfunction is slim at best, there are many potential causes of erectile dysfunction. In general, conditions that negatively impact the strength of blood flow or volume will have a negative impact on erections. The most common physical issues that are connected to erectile dysfunction are high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Methods
This was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. To study a relatively homogeneous population, patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were recruited: men aged 40 to 49 years, all married, with a newly diagnosed, never treated essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥95 mm Hg) and without sexual dysfunction symptoms. Patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction or stroke, secondary hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, renal failure (serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL), diabetes mellitus, or any relevant chronic disease were excluded from the study. All patients gave their informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee.The study design consisted of a 4-week run-in period on placebo, followed by a 16-week active treatment period, during which the patients were randomly treated daily with 20 mg lisinopril or 100 mg atenolol.

Is morphine addictive?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/morphine-treatment/how-addictive," As morphine is taken or abused consistently, these changes become more ingrained. Morphine may become the main way a person is able to feel pleasure; thus, a dependence may form. From Abuse and Dependence to Addiction
Not everyone who develops a dependence on morphine may become addicted to it, but it is highly likely. When someone uses a drug for recreational purposes (i.e., beyond the scope of a legitimate prescription), the risk for becoming addicted to the drug increases. Injecting, snorting, or smoking morphine sends the drug rapidly across the barrier between the brain and blood, and circumvents any extended-release properties, sending the entire dosage into the bloodstream at once. Not only does this raise the risk for a potentially fatal overdose from suppressed respiration rates, it also may lead more quickly to dependence and addiction.",it is highly likely,neutral,"

This is how physical dependence begins,” Schiff says.Misuse of morphineMorphine is considered a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States because it has a high potential for misuse.Morphine misuse may come on so slowly, you might not realize it’s happening. For example, you could start taking the drug a few minutes earlier each time, which could increasingly cut time in between doses.“A red flag is when someone starts making excuses to use beyond the need for pain relief, for instance,” says Jeff Chervenak, a therapist and recovery coach in Avon, Connecticut.Misuse of morphine can cause: confusionconstipationdizzinessdrowsinessitchinesslabored breathinglowered blood pressureupset stomach, nausea, or vomitingWhat’s an addiction?Addiction looks different for everyone.

People addicted to Morphine have developed a high tolerance to it. Sometimes, a Morphine addiction is so advanced that its users need more of the drug just to feel normal. Some common side effects of Morphine addiction are anxiety, depression, and negative personal and professional impacts.

It carries relatively similar rates of addiction as other full opioid agonists such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, heroin, or fentanyl. [2] What Is Happening in the Body When You Take Morphine?Opioids bind to and activate opioid receptors that are present on cells in the body, including your brain and spinal cord.

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/juicing-for-diabetics," Can raise blood sugarOne of the main problems with drinking juice is not the juice itself but it’s potential to quickly raise your blood sugar. This is of particular concern for those with diabetes.Drinking 100% juice is not associated with an increased risk of diabetes, though it may not be the best choice for those who already have the condition (10, 11).While juices are a concentrated source of beneficial nutrients, they’re also a concentrated source of carbs in the form of sugar. If you have diabetes, carefully monitoring and controlling your carb intake is essential to maintaining balanced blood sugar levels. Eating a high-fiber diet can slow the rate of absorption of sugar from your digestive tract, reducing total blood sugar response (12).Because a large portion of the fiber is removed from fruits and vegetables in the juicing process, the sugars in these foods are consumed and absorbed more quickly, leading to rapid blood sugar spikes (11, 13).For instance, it takes 2–3 whole oranges to make a single cup (8 ounces or 237 ml) of fresh orange juice. Most people would agree that downing this amount of orange juice is a lot easier and faster than peeling, slicing, chewing, and swallowing several whole oranges.

Some fruits do contain more sugar than others, but that doesn't mean you can't eat them if you have diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates in a food affects blood sugar levels more than the source of the carbohydrates — or whether that carbohydrate source is a starch or sugar.

The associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed significantly among individual fruits (P<0.001 in all cohorts).Conclusion Our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk.IntroductionFruits are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that may have beneficial health effects. Increasing fruit consumption has been recommended for the primary prevention of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes,1 although epidemiologic studies have generated somewhat mixed results regarding the link with risk of type 2 diabetes.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The inconsistency among these studies may be explained by differences in types of fruits consumed in different study populations as well as difference in participants’ characteristics, study design, and assessment methods, although a meta-analysis did not show that the associations differed by sex, study design, or location.10 Furthermore, in a recent study, the greater variety, but not quantity, of fruits consumed was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.4 This finding suggested that individual fruits might not be equally associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in that fruits have highly variable contents of fibre, antioxidants, other nutrients, and phytochemicals that jointly may influence the risk.11 12 Additionally, the glycemic index, which represents the quality of carbohydrate, or glycemic load, which represents the quality and quantity of carbohydrate and their interaction, vary substantially for individual fruits.13We examined the associations of individual fruit consumption in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes using data from three prospective cohort studies in US adults. Moreover, we estimated substitution effects of individual fruits for fruit juice in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes. Secondarily, we examined the associations of fruit groups based on their glycemic index and glycemic load values with risk of type 2 diabetes.MethodsStudy populationWe used data from the Nurses’ Health Study (established in 1976; n=121 700), the Nurses’ Health Study II (established in 1989; n=116 671), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (established in 1986; n=51 529).",greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk,neutral,"

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/diabetes-warning-over-risk-sugary-28986535," Sarah Coe, nutrition scientist from the British Nutrition Foundation, said: “Unlike whole fruit, fruit juice – whether from concentrate or not from concentrate - contains free sugars."" She added that free sugars are ""released from the structure of the fruit"", and so its consumption should be ""limited"". ""We can drink a glass of juice much quicker and in greater quantities than it would take us to eat the number of whole fruits it took to make it,"" says Sarah. ""So, it’s very easy to drink large quantities of fruit juice in a short space of time and this can result in excess consumption of calories as well as sugars. ""This can lead to blood glucose levels going up quickly, which can be a particular concern for people living with diabetes.""

Can fruit juice increase the risk of diabetes?,https://defeatdiabetes.org/resources/healthful-eating/healthy-beverages/fruit-juice/," Fruit juices can still be loaded with many important micronutrients, especially vitamins and minerals, that are not broken down during the process of juicing, and this is especially true when blended from whole fruits. However, though fresh fruit juices with no added sugar are certainly recommendable in comparison to sugary drinks like sodas and packaged and processed fruit beverages with added sugar or made from concentrate, the main conclusions to take away from this post are that fruit juices overall have less fiber and a significantly higher glycemic load than the whole fruits they are derived from, and are often consumed in addition to solid foods, not in substitution. Therefore, their frequent consumption can potentially increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. For diabetics and those at high risk for developing diabetes, as well as individuals looking to maintain overall health, eating whole fresh fruits, and drinking healthful beverages like water and unsweetened coffee and tea, are the best options for regulating blood glucose levels and maintaining a healthy weight.Resources and Further Reading2013 study revealing many aspects of why fruit juices increase risk of developing diabetes as opposed to whole fruits: http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001A study about sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juices and sodas and incidence of type 2 diabetes: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/3/517.longA guide that gives some solid recommendations on diabetes prevention, including limiting fruit juice intake and explanations about glycemic index and load: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#referencesGlycemic and Glycemic Load guide from Harvard: https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foodsSugar-sweetened beverages such as packaged and processed fruit juice, and diabetes incidence in African American women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663160?dopt=Citation

It is estimated that one in three people will suffer with arthritis at some point in their lives and the use of magnetic bracelets and magnetic therapy plays a positive role in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of arthritis. Magnetic therapy is a natural way to treat arthritis in both humans and animals. Small high strength magnets are used on the body by the main arteries or as close to the point of pain as possible. Static magnets penetrate through the skin and deep into the tissues and blood stream, the damaged cells around the inflammation react to the magnetic field by realigning their ions into the correct position and start the process of removing the excess fluid from within the cell. As the inflammation reduces, the damage caused begins to be repaired by a fresh and rich supply of oxygen and nutrients.",alleviating the debilitating symptoms of arthritis,neutral,"

Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160418-the-surprising-downsides-of-sit-ups," Researchers are not only arguing over whether sit-ups do you any good – but whether they might even be bad for you. Do they give you a taut six-pack across your abdomen or does a flat stomach depend more on diet and general exercise than a specific routine? A review of all the research conducted on sit-ups reports evidence that they do improve flexibility and muscle strength and that in dogs flexing the spine has been shown to help the delivery of nutrients to the discs which could prevent stiffness.So far, so good. But to get the desired six-pack does take an awful lot of work. In a small randomised controlled trial in Illinois in 2011 one group did daily abdominal exercises while the lucky control group did none. After six weeks detailed measurements were taken and it was found that the sit-ups made no difference to waist size or the amount of fat around their stomachs.Some people may be genetically predisposed to suffer back pain from sit-ups (Credit: Getty Images)Many sportspeople do sit-ups as part of a raft of exercises which aim to improve their core stability, but research from Thomas Nesser from Indiana State University suggests that improving your core stability doesn’t necessarily result in better athletic performance.Whether or not they provide you with precisely the physique or fitness you desire, could sit-ups bring unintended consequences such as back pain?",whether they might even be bad for you,neutral,"

"
Are sit ups bad for you?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/want-a-stronger-core-skip-the-sit-ups," One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back - they push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort. Second, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles. Finally, activities of daily living, as well as sports and recreational activities, call on your muscles to work together, not in isolation. Sit-ups or crunches strengthen just a few muscle groups. Through dynamic patterns of movement, a good core workout like plank exercises helps strengthen the entire set of core muscles you use every day.",hard on your back,neutral,"

      Sit-ups and crunches might be good for your abs, but they're potentially damaging for your back. These exercises are not as effective as many alternatives and, worse, they can contribute to spinal issues such as herniated discs.

If you possess a basic level of strength, however, a push-up doesn’t really fall into that category. Up until 20 or reps, a push-up is more of a muscle-toning than muscle-building exercise. And after 20 reps it becomes primarily a test of local muscle endurance (which may be one reason why the results of old-school push-up tests used by the military and the government tend to not correlate with overall fitness statistics). Likewise, the general thinking on crunches and sit-ups is that one can do them every day of the week, not just because prisoners do so with such great outcomes, but because bodyweight core strengthening is more along the lines of flexibility training than strength trainingit simply requires less recovery.",it simply requires less recovery,neutral,"

In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality.

A switch in handedness changes the brain
Forcing lefties to be righties results in more brain activity. Kerri Smith

            



Some brain regions are more active in 'converted' left-handers.Punchstock'Southpaw', 'goofy', or just plain 'lefty' are some of the many names that left-handers have been called. In certain societies, the aversion can go so far that some left-handers are forced to write with their right hand, regardless of their natural tendencies. Now, a study of such 'converted' left-handers has found that the way their brains are organized, and how hard particular regions work, changes as a result of this switch. Some areas of the brain continue to look like those of a practising lefty, whereas other areas switch to the patterns of a righty, the research reveals. ""The question now is, 'do converts suffer because of this extra attention that they exert?",Forcing lefties to be righties results in more brain activity,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/7/2816," Until some decades ago, innately left-handed children who attended German schools were often forced to use their right hand for writing. Because of life-long practice, these converted left-handers became as proficient at right-hand writing as innate right-handers. Yet most of these converted left-handers continued to use their left hand for other manual skills, which were less subject to social control. Indeed, attempts to switch handedness usually failed to establish a consistent preference for the right hand in innately left-handed subjects (Porac and Buller, 1990). Such considerations raise the question of whether converted left-handers use the same brain areas as innate right-handers for the selection and execution of handwriting and how much (covert) left-handedness might persist during right-hand writing in converted left-handers.To address this issue, we investigated the functional neuroanatomy of right-hand writing in converted left-handers and innate right-handers. Because most converted left-handers still demonstrate overt left-handedness during manual skills other than handwriting (Porac and Buller, 1990), we postulated that the functional neuroanatomy of right-hand writing in converted left-handers would differ from innately right-handers, showing persisting features of covert left-handedness.",attempts to switch handedness,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/inside-the-mind-of-a-left-hander/," However, he notes that the research on how exactly that works is in progress. Cowell describes the development of handedness as a sort of positive feedback loop: “Presumably, there is going to be some environmental influence early on. It could be prenatal, it could be early postnatal, but once the person is in a position where they’re developing along a trajectory where they have the capacity to become a left-hander, then by virtue of being left-handed, that is in itself an influence on the brain.”Further, if someone is naturally left-handed but forced to use their right hand, then their brain might reflect experience-dependent changes. Although it differs enormously by geographic region, there have been studies in which left-handed subjects were forced to use their right hands. Their resulting brain scans showed something striking. “In terms of lateralization of the motor functions, they are sort of half in between the right and left halves,” Willems said.",by virtue of being left-handed,neutral,"

In the United States and Britain, it was regular practice to retrain lefties as righties throughout the 20th century.

Another study furthered this idea of our handedness and brain being interconnected. Researchers asked a group of right-handed participants to clench their right fist before memorizing a group of words. Remember, movement of the right hand signals the left side of the brain to ‘turn on’. These participants performed significantly better in recalling the memorized words than their counter-parts, a group of right-handers who clenched their left fists before memorization. Dr. Daniel Geschwind, professor of psychiatry, neurology and human genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles says that while the majority of right-handers process language in the left-hemisphere, lefties have an equal distribution of this skill across their brains.",lefties have an equal distribution of this skill across their brains,neutral,"

Can a speech problem be caused by right handed person being forced to left hand?,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/9/3271," The location found in our study suggests that forced preference for right-hand writing had greatest impact on the striatal territory that provides an interface between executive and cognitive control of skilled movements. We argue that a forced switch of handedness represents an early and persistent environmental modulator of maturation of the basal ganglia, which itself is genetically determined and only complete in the third decade of life (Steen et al., 1997; Sowell et al., 1999; Snook et al., 2005). Morphometric studies in children aged 7–16 have described a substantial loss of striatal and pallidal volume during normal development (Sowell et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2000), likely because of pruning processes. Studies in genetically caused disorders found a relative size increase of these structures compared with controls (Binkofski et al., 2007; Gothelf et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning in the territory of the putamen that integrates executive and cognitive aspects of motor control. In converted left-handers, individual variations in the volume of the left midputamen correlate with the acquired dexterity of handwriting.",environmental challenge posed by forced right-handed writing enhances normal pruning,neutral,"

Although it's initially sterile, urine left outside of the body for an extended period can easily grow bacteria, the JCAD study states. If consumed or rubbed on the skin, the bacteria in the urine could expose you to an infection. Urine therapy is also risky because it's unregulated, and all medical remedies should be monitored or prescribed by a doctor. Bottom Line

Some of pink Himalayan salt’s commonly promoted health claims include that it can: Improve respiratory diseasesBalance your body’s pHReduce signs of agingImprove sleep qualityRegulate blood sugarIncrease libidoSome of the claims related to the non-dietary uses of pink Himalayan salt may be loosely based on research.The use of salt caves as a treatment for various lung diseases has been evaluated in a few studies. The results suggest that there could be some benefit, but overall, more rigorous research is needed to investigate their effectiveness (7, 8, 9).On the other hand, some of these health claims are actually just normal functions of sodium chloride in the body, so you’ll get these benefits from any kind of salt.For example, researchers have found that very low-salt diets may contribute to sleeping problems (10). This suggests that an adequate amount of salt may be necessary for quality sleep. However, the study did not examine pink Himalayan salt and it is likely a function of the sodium chloride in any salt.Also, the minerals in pink Himalayan salt are not present in large enough quantities to have any effect on balancing the body’s pH.

Can fish oil improve your cholesterol?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1995786/," Intake of the vitamin E-rich fish oil resulted in a marked decrease in serum triglycerides (48%) and in fibrinogen (11%). After administration of the low vitamin E-containing oil there was a considerably smaller reduction of serum triglycerides and no significant reduction of fibrinogen. Both oils caused an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in the atherogenic index, but neither oil altered the total cholesterol level. Serum vitamin E was decreased by 9% and plasma malondialdehyde was increased by 122% after intake of the low vitamin E-containing oil, but both remained normal after intake of the other oil. The effect of vitamin E may be due to inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation with less formation of malondialdehyde and a larger amount of active (n-3) fatty acids in their sites of action in the liver, resulting in a greater decrease in the synthesis of triglycerides and fibrinogen.

While these effects can certainly be beneficial for those with high blood pressure, it can cause serious problems for those who have low blood pressure.Fish oil may also interact with blood pressure-lowering medications, so it’s important to discuss supplements with your doctor if you’re receiving treatment for high blood pressure.Summary Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to lower blood pressure, which may interfere with certain medications and cause problems for those with low blood pressure.4. DiarrheaDiarrhea is one of the most common side effects associated with taking fish oil, and may be especially prevalent while taking high doses.In fact, one review reported that diarrhea is one of the most common adverse effects of fish oil, alongside other digestive symptoms such as flatulence (10).In addition to fish oil, other types of omega-3 supplements may also cause diarrhea.Flaxseed oil, for example, is a popular vegetarian alternative to fish oil, but has been shown to have a laxative effect and may increase bowel movement frequency (11).If you experience diarrhea after taking omega-3 fatty acids, make sure you’re taking your supplements with meals and consider decreasing your dosage to see if symptoms persist.Summary Diarrhea is a side effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplements such as fish oil and flaxseed oil.5. Acid RefluxAlthough fish oil is known for its powerful effects on heart health, many people report feeling heartburn after starting to take fish oil supplements.Other acid reflux symptoms — including belching, nausea and stomach discomfort — are common side effects of fish oil due largely to its high fat content. Fat has been shown to trigger indigestion in several studies (12, 13).Sticking to a moderate dose and taking supplements with meals can often effectively reduce acid reflux and relieve symptoms.Additionally, splitting your dose into a few smaller portions throughout the day may help eliminate indigestion.Summary Fish oil is high in fat and may cause acid reflux symptoms such as belching, nausea, indigestion and heartburn in some people.6.

Research Report


Cannabis (Marijuana) Research Report
Is marijuana addictive? Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. Recent data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of marijuana use disorder.18 People who begin using marijuana before the age of 18 are four to seven times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder than adults.19
Marijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence—in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. People who use marijuana frequently often report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness, and/or various forms of physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to 2 weeks.20,21 Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.22,23
Marijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the person cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because epidemiological studies of substance use often use dependence as a proxy for addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted. Those studies suggest that 9% of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it,24,25 rising to about 17% in those who start using in their teens.26,27
In 2015, about 4.0 million people in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder;3 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment for their marijuana use.28

Can you become addicted to weed?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/marijuana-rehab/is-it-addictive," Yes, marijuana can be addictive.8 Although not everyone who uses marijuana becomes addicted to it, it is possible to develop a marijuana addiction or a cannabis use disorder. In 2020, approximately 14.2 million people aged 12 or older met the diagnostic criteria for a cannabis use disorder within the past year.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a cannabis use disorder, with a higher risk for people who begin using marijuana before the age of 18.5,7 Marijuana accounts for nearly half of admissions into substance use treatment for youth between the ages of 12 to 17.7
An individual who regularly uses marijuana may develop a cannabis use disorder, where cannabis use becomes uncontrollable and begins to impact normal functioning, such as failure to fulfill role responsibilities at home or work, physical dependence, and health problems.9
Cannabis use disorder can range from mild, to moderate, to severe. Severe forms of cannabis use disorder are often referred to as marijuana/cannabis addiction due to compulsive drug use behavior despite the negative impact it has on aspects of an individual’s life, including significant impairment across life domains—like interpersonal relationships, work and/or school performance, and negative effects on psychological and physical health.8,9
Withdrawal symptoms, an indicator of physiological dependence, can occur when an individual who has used cannabis frequently—such as daily or almost daily—abruptly stops using cannabis or significantly reduces their use.9 Withdrawal from marijuana can cause significant discomfort and distress, which may lead the person to return to marijuana use to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.9
 

Why Is Marijuana Addictive? Chronic cannabis use is associated with physiological changes in the brain that may contribute to the continued use of marijuana. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, appears to be responsible for marijuana’s reinforcing properties and a primary contributor to marijuana addiction.10,11 Results from empirical studies have shown that THC stimulates neurons in the reward system to release the signaling chemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine at levels higher than typically observed in response to natural rewarding stimuli. Alterations in dopamine signaling or levels of dopamine are generally associated with other drugs of addiction.10
Signs of Marijuana Abuse and Addiction
Signs that a loved one might be using marijuana may include changes to their overall demeanor—such as being unusually giggly or uncoordinated—finding it hard to remember things that just happened, or finding marijuana-related paraphernalia like pipes, rolling papers, and vape pens in their possessions.7,12

Of them, 138,000 voluntarily sought treatment.The use disorder, according to researchers, can morph into an addiction when the person can’t stop using the drug even when it interferes with their daily activities.The Canyon, a treatment center in Malibu, California, lists 10 signs that someone might have an addiction to marijuana. Among the signals is a growing tolerance for the drug’s effects, as well as using more marijuana than they initially intended to use.Who becomes addicted to marijuana and why?Genes are one strong predictor of developing an addiction, said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California.Studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory. They have higher rates of an addiction co-occurring, which means that if one of them develops an addiction, the other is at greater risk for developing one, than fraternal twins raised apart.But family ties may also help some people avoid progressing to a state of addiction.“When we look at the criteria for addiction, it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior,” explained Carl Hart, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York and author of “High Price,” in a 2016 interview with Healthline. “It has a lot to do with responsibility skills… It’s not perfect, but when you look at the people who are addicted, and you look at people who have jobs and families, they have responsibilities, they’re plugged into their societies, they have a social network, the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs, families, social networks.”Those who don’t become addicted also tend to have more options.“Most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good,” said Gantt Galloway, PharmD, executive and research director of the New Leaf Treatment Center and senior scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, in a 2016 interview with Healthline.“Those who have fewer choices, who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships… those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction.”Mental health conditions, which have both genetic and environmental causes play a large one in a person’s chance of developing an addiction.“Mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction,” said Stalcup.",those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive,neutral,"

Can vegan diets be healthy?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegetarian-diet-plan," Other variations involve the inclusion or exclusion of eggs, dairy, and other animal products.Health benefitsVegetarian diets are associated with a number of health benefits.In fact, studies show that vegetarians tend to have better diet quality than meat-eaters and a higher intake of important nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium (4, 5).A vegetarian diet may provide several other health boosts as well.May enhance weight lossSwitching to a vegetarian diet can be an effective strategy if you’re looking to lose weight.In fact, one review of 12 studies noted that vegetarians, on average, experienced 4.5 more pounds (2 kilograms) of weight loss over 18 weeks than non-vegetarians (6).Similarly, a 6-month study in 74 people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that vegetarian diets were nearly twice as effective at reducing body weight than low calorie diets (7).Plus, a 2009 study in nearly 61,000 adults showed that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than omnivores — BMI being a measurement of body fat based on height and weight (8).However, more research is needed to understand which specific aspects of the vegetarian diet or lifestyle may be responsible for this association.May reduce cancer riskSome research suggests that a vegetarian diet may be linked to a lower risk of cancer — including those of the breast, colon, and rectum (9, 10).However, current research is limited to observational studies, which cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Keep in mind that some studies have turned up inconsistent findings (11, 12).Therefore, more research is needed to understand how vegetarianism may impact cancer risk.May stabilize blood sugarSeveral studies indicate that vegetarian diets may help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.For instance, one 2014 review of six studies linked vegetarianism to improved blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes (13).Vegetarian diets may also prevent diabetes by stabilizing blood sugar levels in the long term.According to one study in 2,918 people, switching from a non-vegetarian to a vegetarian diet was associated with a 53% reduced risk of diabetes over an average of 5 years (14).Promotes heart healthVegetarian diets reduce several heart disease risk factors to help keep your heart healthy and strong.One recent review found that vegan diets could lead to a small reduction in total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, both of which are risk factors for heart disease (15).However, the same review also found that vegan diets led to an increase in triglycerides and a reduction in HDL (good) cholesterol levels compared to other dietary interventions (15).Similarly, another study in 118 people found that a low calorie vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol than a Mediterranean diet. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet led to a greater reduction in triglyceride levels (16).Other research indicates that vegetarianism may be associated with lower blood pressure levels. High blood pressure is another key risk factor for heart disease (17).Still, research has turned up mixed results. Therefore, more studies are needed to determine whether vegetarian diets actually reduce the risk of developing or dying from heart disease (18, 19).Summary Not only do vegetarians tend to have a higher intake of several key nutrients, but vegetarianism has been associated with weight loss, reduced cancer risk, improved blood sugar, and better heart health. However, more research is needed.Potential downsidesA well-rounded vegetarian diet can be healthy and nutritious.However, it may also increase your risk of certain nutritional deficiencies.Meat, poultry and fish supply a good amount of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as micronutrients like zinc, selenium, iron, and vitamin B12 (20).Other animal products like dairy and eggs also contain plenty of calcium, vitamin D, and B vitamins (21, 22).When cutting meat or other animal products from your diet, it’s important to ensure you’re getting these essential nutrients from other sources.Studies show that vegetarians are at a higher risk of protein, calcium, iron, iodine, and vitamin B12 deficiencies (23, 24, 25, 26).A nutritional deficiency in these key micronutrients can lead to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, anemia, bone loss, and thyroid issues (27, 28, 29, 30).Including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and fortified foods is an easy way to ensure you’re getting appropriate nutrition.Multivitamins and supplements are another option to quickly bump up your intake and compensate for potential deficiencies.SummaryCutting out meat and animal-based products can increase your risk of nutritional deficiencies.",downsidesA well-rounded vegetarian diet can be healthy and nutritious,yes,"

These include:Legumes: Increasing legume intake may reduce heart disease risk.Whole grains: Whole grain intake may decrease the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease.Nuts: Consumption of nuts may reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease.Research suggests that vegans may have up to a 75% lower chance of developing high blood pressure.Aiding weight lossRaw vegan diets may aid in weight loss. One study indicates that over 3.7 years, people on raw vegan diets lost 9.9–12 kilograms (21.8–26.5 pounds). However, between around 14–25% of the study participants became underweight.Overweight and obesity may increase a person’s likelihood of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Consuming a raw vegan diet may help a person lose weight and reduce their risk of these health conditions.Reducing diabetes riskFew studies explore how raw vegan diets affect a person’s risk of diabetes. However, 2009 research suggests that vegan diets almost halve a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to non-vegetarian diets.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend dietary changes that can reduce a person’s risk of developing diabetes.",healthA raw vegan diet may be beneficial for heart health,yes,"

One way in which this claim could be examined is by focusing on mortality differences between vegans and others. The problem, however, is that no studies exist of populations where omnivores share similar genetic profiles, similar lifestyle patterns, and similar social and environmental factors with a significant number of vegans. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies—that is, studies which compare, usually over a long time, those who remain healthy with those who become ill—from the UK, Germany, California, the USA, the Netherlands, and Japan, including 124,706 participants, compared vegetarians with omnivores and found that all-cause mortality was 9% lower amongst vegetarians (T.

Part 330, hydroquinone and other non-prescription drugs that are not described in specified provisions are deemed new drugs, misbranded and must be subject to a new drug application. This change is the result of a loophole in the law that has implicated hydroquinone unnecessarily.” The recent U.S. ban follows prior bans in other parts of the world like Japan, Australia and Europe. “Hydroquinone has been long banned in Europe because it is cyto-toxic, meaning it is toxic to the cells to prevent making of melanin pigments,” explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. The Concern About Hydroquinone New York dermatologist Jacob Levitt, MD explains that the main concern about over-the-counter hydroquinone is unmonitored overuse. “The concern is that this would lead to exogenous ochronosis, which is relatively rare but difficult to treat in darker skinned individuals.

In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned for use in skin lightening products since January 2001. Its use in skin lightening has been associated with leukoderma-en-confetti, a condition that is characterized by confetti like depigmented areas of the skin, and ochronosis. Prior to the ban, Hydroquinone was the most common ingredient in skin lighteners. However, its use was limited to localised areas of the skin such as age spots under the European Cosmetic Regulation. Eventually, it became evident that it was being used on larger areas and that its use was linked to the above conditions plus other possible health risks. As it turns out, numerous articles about the carcinogenicity of hydroquinone and possible long-term effects have been published since 1996.","In Europe, the use of Hydroquinone has been banned",yes,"

The potential side effects of hydroquinone
Classified as a skin allergen and potentially dangerous, hydroquinone has been banned in the European Union, Japan and Australia. “We’ve found that maybe 16–17% of patients have sensitivity to hydroquinone, whether [as] an irritant or an actual true allergy,” explains Dr. Suneel Chilukuri, a dermatologist in Houston. “It’s hard to define, but we know that hydroquinone actually makes your pigmentation worse [if you are allergic to it] because of the inflammatory response that’s there.”
Chronic, long-term use of hydroquinone has also been linked to an increased risk in the development of disorders such as ochronosis. “Ochronosis is a syndrome caused by the accumulation of homogentisic acid [which is associated with the production of brown pigment] in connective tissues,” says Dr. Aranmolate. “This often leads to hyperpigmentation and ‘caviar-like’ lesions on the skin.” According to a study in the Indian Journal of Dermatology, the first reports of ochronosis were found in South Africa, where the skin disorder was described in 28–35% of the black population.",hydroquinone has been banned,neutral,"

Why it's sketch: ""It’s outlawed in Europe and Japan and pretty much everywhere, yet it's still used here,” Sobel says of the ingredient used to lighten skin pigment and spots. “It is cytotoxic, meaning it will kill cells and chromosomes if overused, which can lead to some cancers."" It's just shocking that while mouse studies in Europe revealed a link between heavy use and cancer, the U.S. continues to use hydroquinone at a prescription-only level of 4 percent (to control the exposure to the drug) and at 2 percent, which are available over-the-counter.

This is particularly true for BIPOC patients, who are often disproportionately affected by dyschromia.With an FDA-approved formulation and inclusion on the Bulk Substances list for compounding, many experts feel it’s unlikely that the FDA will entirely remove hydroquinone from the U.S. market anytime soon. But the controversy surrounding the drug has spurred efforts to find safe and effective alternatives to treat hyperpigmentation.A Brief History of Hydroquinone1978: As the first step in creating an official monograph, an FDA advisory panel proposes recommendations for regulating skin bleaching products. Based on evidence presented, the panel suggests that hydroquinone be generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) in concentrations of 1.5 percent to 2 percent and labeled to discontinue use after two months if no improvement is made.1982: After public comments, the FDA proposes a tentative final monograph (TFM). The agency rejects an appeal from industry to allow concentrations up to 4 percent hydroquinone based on study findings showing no significant difference in efficacy between 2 percent and 4 percent. The FDA agrees with the panel’s conclusion that high concentrations of hydroquinone with exposure to the sun may cause disfiguring effects.1999: The International Agency for Research and Cancer (IARC) determines that hydroquinone is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans due to inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals.2001: The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone due to concerns about leukoderma-en-confetti and exogenous ochronosis.2006: Based on additional research and data, the FDA decides to reverse its recommendation and proposes to classify hydroquinone as not GRASE, effectively withdrawing the tentative final monograph for the skin bleaching category.",The European Union bans OTC hydroquinone,yes,"

Most urinary tract infections in men cannot be prevented. Practicing safe sex by using condoms will help to prevent infections that are transmitted through sexual contact. In men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, cutting out caffeine and alcohol or taking certain prescription medications may help to improve urine flow and prevent the buildup of urine in the bladder, which increases the likelihood of infection. Many men with urinary infections due to an enlarged prostate gland require surgery to remove part of the gland. Because this surgery can improve urine flow, it can help prevent infections. Treatment

It may ultimately cause harmful bacterial growth to reach the male urinary tract and result in urinary tract infection. Therefore, uncircumcised males are at higher risk of getting a UTI. Especially, uncircumcised males with a tight foreskin that cannot be retracted (phimosis) easily come in contact with a urinary tract infection.

Do men get UTI infections?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320872," Most cases in older men are caused by the bacterium known as Escherichia coli, which is naturally present in the body.Cases similar to UTIs in younger men are typically caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs).A UTI develops when the bacterium gets into the urinary tract through the urethra and starts multiplying.As men have longer urethras than women, they are less prone to UTIs because bacteria need to travel a longer distance to reach the bladder.UTIs are four times more common in women than in men.A person’s risk of developing a UTI increases if they have:diabeteskidney stonesan enlarged prostatean abnormal narrowing of the urethraan inability to voluntarily control urinationan inability to empty the bladder completelynot drunk enough liquidsnot been circumciseda past diagnosis of a UTIurinary tract abnormalities that prevent urine from leaving the body normally or cause urine to back up in the urethrahad anal intercourse, which can expose the urethra to bacteriaa health condition or taking medication that suppresses the immune systemhad a procedure involving instrumentation on the urinary tractExamples of these procedures include the insertion of a tube to drain the bladder, or a small camera, known as a cystoscopy, to examine the bladder and urethra.Can men get UTIs from women?Men can get UTIs from women during sex, by getting the bacteria from a woman with the infection. However, this is unlikely.Typically, the infection arises from bacteria that are already present in the man’s body.DiagnosisShare on PinterestA physician may carry out a urine dipstick test to identify a UTI.A doctor can diagnose a UTI by carrying out a physical examination, taking a medical history, and through laboratory tests.Physical examinationThe doctor may perform a physical examination that includes:checking the vital signschecking the abdomen, bladder area, sides, and back for pain or swellingexamining the genitalsMedical historyThe doctor may ask if the person has had other UTIs in the past, or a family history of UTIs.They may also question the person about their symptoms.Laboratory testsLaboratory tests are required to diagnose the infection as the symptoms of a UTI can be common to other diseases.A urine sample is usually needed to look for the presence of pus and the bacteria causing the infection.Men may be asked to give a urine sample. A man will need to start the urine stream to clean the urethra, and then collect a midstream sample in a cup. As bacteria multiply quickly at room temperature, this urine sample is either sent to the laboratory immediately or kept refrigerated until later.The doctor may also ask for a urine test strip, also known as a urine dipstick test. This is a quick test in which a plastic or paper ribbon is dipped into the urine sample and then removed. If the person has a UTI, the ribbon will turn a particular color.To obtain the best results for this test, the doctor will probably request that a person does it first thing in the morning.Other medical examsFor people with a history of kidney stones, diabetes, polycystic kidneys, or tuberculosis, the doctor may also require imaging exams.TreatmentUTIs in men are usually complicated and require treatment.The goal of treatment is to prevent the infection from spreading to the kidneys or the upper urinary tract.The type of treatment used depends on the cause of the infection.",TreatmentUTIs in men are usually complicated and require treatment,neutral,"

   Risks of UTIs in men  

Anatomy benefits aside, men can get UTIs, and there are some things that can increase their risk. ""For men, there almost always has to be an underlying condition to get a UTI,"" says Dr. Herman. Men can get UTIs if they have kidneys stones or an enlarged prostate, says Bruce Sloane, MD, urologist at Philadelphia Urology Associates. Both can cause a blockage in the urinary tract, leading to a back-up of urine that creates a bacteria-friendly environment. Some STIs, including chlamydia or gonorrhea, can also lead to inflammation of the urethra, notes the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which makes it easier for bacteria to infect the urinary tract. Diabetes is another condition that increases men's risk of diabetes.",men can get UTIs,neutral,"

But because a UTI in a man is often considered complicated, according to Dr. Trost, additional testing is usually necessary to determine why he got a UTI.“This typically includes not only a urinary culture to confirm an infection, but also a special study to evaluate how much urine he leaves behind after urinating, and an imaging study, such as a CT [computerized tomography] scan, to evaluate for kidney stones or other anatomic abnormalities that may be causing this,” he explains.If a man has recurrent infections or infections with the same organism, or UTI-like symptoms without a positive urine culture, then further testing may be necessary.Any man who suspects he may have a UTI should see his doctor right away so that he can begin treatment as soon as possible.RELATED: Vegetarian Diet Linked to Lowered Risk Of Urinary Tract InfectionHow Urinary Tract Infections Are Treated in MenWhether an infection affects a man or a woman, the treatment is the same: a round of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and get rid of UTI symptoms.",men do get UTIs,yes,"

You’ve probably heard that carrots are good for your eyes, and it’s true. Carrots are a super source of beta-carotene—and that’s a start. But it takes a whole lot more to protect your irreplaceable vision.

Though there is truth to this, the association between carrots and eyesight originated from a myth. During World War II, British Royal Air Force pilots first began using radar to target and shoot down enemy planes. In an effort to keep this new technology a secret, the visual accuracy of the pilots — especially at night — was attributed to eating carrots. This led to a longstanding propaganda campaign that promoted carrots for better eyesight.

You’ll need help from prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses or vision surgery if you have any notable level of blurry vision.However, if your vision is just starting to worsen, eating carrots and other sources of vitamin A could slowly improve your eyesight.If you’re experiencing any eye or vision problems, schedule a comprehensive eye exam with an eye doctor.

The long-term health effects of low-grade pesticide intake are unclear, but some scientists have voiced concerns (43).SUMMARY While no evidence suggests that organic carrots are more nutritious than conventionally grown ones, organic varieties are less likely to harbor pesticides. Baby carrotsBaby carrots are an increasingly popular snack food.Two kinds of carrots are called baby carrots, which can be misleading.One the one hand, there are whole carrots harvested while still small.On the other hand, there are baby-cut carrots, which are pieces from larger carrots that have been machine-cut into the preferred size, then peeled, polished, and sometimes washed in small amounts of chlorine before packing.There’s very little difference in nutrients between regular and baby carrots, and they should have the same health effects.SUMMARY Baby carrots are whole carrots harvested before they grow large, while baby-cut carrots are pieces from larger carrots that have been machine-cut, peeled, polished, and washed before packing.",improved eye health,neutral,"

Is methanol poisonous?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_toxicity," This is not to be confused with ""meth"", a common abbreviation for methamphetamine and for methadone in Britain and the United States. Mechanism[edit]
Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms. First, methanol (whether it enters the body by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin) can be fatal due to its CNS depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning. Second, in a process of toxication, it is metabolized to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver. [7] Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via aldehyde dehydrogenase. The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining.",can be fatal,neutral,"

Products that contain methanol include windshield washer fluid, gas line antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, copy machine fluid, perfumes, food warming fuel, and other types of fuels. Exposures can cause varying degrees of toxicity and can require a range of treatments from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatments are either ethanol or fomepizole, and unlike ethylene glycol toxicity, dialysis is often recommended.

Is methanol poisonous?,https://draxe.com/nutrition/methanol-poisoning/," By itself, it has a scent similar to ethanol. If you’re comparing methanol vs. ethanol, both are byproducts of fermentation (including the making of alcoholic beverages), but unlike ethanol, methanol is generally considered poisonous for human consumption. It’s also natural for small amounts of it to be present in living organisms as a part of their normal metabolic processes. For example, this chemical occurs naturally in vegetables and fruits, wood, volcanic gases, and decaying vegetation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevenetion, “Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body.”
As a result of it being produced as a man-made chemical, you can find it in the air as a result of car emissions, paint and solvent fumes, as well as burning waste.",methanol is generally considered poisonous,neutral,"

Moderation in drinking is wise! Methanol on the other hand is converted first into formaldehyde and then into formic acid. High levels of formic acid cause a range of different effects including something called acidosis, where the acidity of your blood gets too high and a number of organs (like the kidney) begin to malfunction. Formic acid is also a primary cause for damage to the nervous system (what toxicologists call neurotoxicity).

Is methanol poisonous?,https://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2013/09/10/3845522.htm," The potential for its presence in drinks made from home-distilled spirits is a serious health risk.Methanol is formed in very small amounts during fermentation, the process by which alcohol is made from plant products like grape juice or cereal grains. There are small amounts in wine and beer, but not enough to cause problems when these products are made at home, says Leigh Schmidtke, a senior lecturer in wine microbiology and production at Charles Sturt University. But home distillation to make spirits like gin or rum concentrates the levels of both ethanol and methanol.Commercially-made spirits are very safe because manufacturers use technologies specifically designed to ensure methanol is separated from the ethanol. But home brew systems are typically not so technically advanced, which makes separation more difficult. ""There are no really safe ways of differentiating methanol from ethanol at home,"" says Schmidtke.Who is at risk?The group of Australians thought most at risk of methanol poisoning are travellers, especially those travelling to countries where home-brewed spirits are widely available, such as Indonesia or Thailand.The safest approach is not to drink any local home-brewed alcohol, although travellers are not always aware of the source of alcohol in drinks they are served.

Can an MRI harm my baby?,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/499273," Abstract and Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and versatile diagnostic tool. Applications of MR technology are rapidly expanding for all patient populations, including infants receiving newborn intensive care. Millions of MR examinations have been conducted without incident or harm, yet rare accidents in the MR environment continue to occur. The infant is vulnerable to many of the potential hazards of MRI, including projectile accidents, radiofrequency electromagnetic field effects, noise hazards, physiologic instability, and adverse effects of transport, positioning, handling, and sedation. The MRI-compatible incubator is a promising means for safe imaging of smaller and less stable infants than previously possible. Proper education of staff and meticulous attention to detail in preparing the infants for MR examinations are the keys to safety during neonatal MRI.",The infant is vulnerable to many of the potential hazards of MRI,neutral,"

And if you want to lose weight, you probably opt for the gum, relegating the pretzels to the snacking corner of shame.But will keeping your mouth busy with something that has little-to-no calories really help you shed pounds?It depends. First off, chewing gum can be very helpful when used as a behavioral tool, says Susan Bowerman, R.D., director of worldwide nutrition, education, and training at Herbalife.For example, if you’re a stress eater, reaching for gum instead of pretzels when you’re on deadline can calm your nerves without the extra calories.

Can chewing gum help lose weight?,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/08/health/chewing-gum-weight-loss-diet-food-drayer/index.html," Chewing certainly doesn’t burn many calories, and it won’t undo the calories you just packed away from, say, a large meal or a Thanksgiving feast. Still, for certain individuals, popping a piece of gum could be a helpful strategy when it comes to shedding pounds, especially if doing so helps you steer clear of midday snacking, nighttime nibbling or caving in on dessert.

This is because it’s both sweet and low in calories, giving you a sweet taste without negatively affecting your diet. Some research also suggests that chewing gum could reduce your appetite, which could prevent you from overeating (30, 31). One small study found that chewing gum between meals decreased feelings of hunger and reduced intake of high carb snacks in the afternoon (32).The results of another small study suggest that chewing gum while walking could help burn more calories (33).However, the overall results are mixed. Some studies have reported that chewing gum does not affect appetite or energy intake over the course of a day (34, 35).One study even found that people who chewed gum were less likely to snack on fruit. However, this may be because the participants were chewing minty gum before eating, which made the fruit taste bad (36).Interestingly, there is also some evidence that chewing gum may increase your metabolic rate (37).",Chewing gum could be a helpful tool,neutral,"

When it comes to weight loss or maintenance, of course, what you eat is crucial, and some research suggests when you eat is important, too. But a new study in Scientific Reports suggests another big component of your eating habits can help: chewing food more slowly. To determine the potential effects of slow chewing, researchers asked 11 healthy, normal-weight men to go through three trials: drinking liquid food normally every 30 seconds, drinking liquid food but keeping it in their mouths for 30 seconds before swallowing, and chewing food for 30 seconds before swallowing.",This Secret Trick Can Help You Start Losing Weight Immediately,neutral,"

These recommendations may be helpful to you, whether or not you’ve had special cataract treatment or undergone cataract surgery.Cataract sunglassesProtection from the sun is important for everyone’s vision — especially for those with cataracts. Sunlight can cause even more damage to eyes and worsen the side effects of cataracts. Fortunately, there are some sunglasses that are designed to help with this. Note: The following protective features are recommended whether you have had cataract surgery or not.Ultraviolet (UV) protectionFor the best protection from the sun, make sure the label or online description for your sunglasses states that they provide 99-100% UV protection against UVA and UVB, or 100% protection against UV 400.

Can sunglasses help prevent cataracts?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/sunglasses-help-prevent-eye-disease," Protection around the eyesAnother factor to consider is that sunglasses help protect the skin around the eyes — areas where it can be hard to apply sunscreen.The AAO advisory recommends buying oversized shades to help protect these areas as well as to cut down on UV rays entering from the sides.For those who want to make sure their shades offer adequate UV protection, the best option is to seek out a UV light meter to test how well the lenses block out UV rays. These meters are commonly found at optical shops.Wearers of contact lenses can easily wear a pair of nonprescription sunglasses to help protect their eyes. But it’s also worth noting that many brands of contact lenses also offer UV protection.“Most rigid gas permeable hard lenses have an ultraviolet filter, which is helpful in protecting from UV rays,” says McLaughlin.“Good sunglasses will certainly help protect the eyes in terms of reducing UV exposure,” concludes McLaughlin. “This will help protect the eyes in terms of lowering the progression of cataracts. I think if we all live long enough, we’re all going to develop cataracts — but this can slow the progression.

But there is some evidence that drinking too much alcohol can increase your risk for cataracts.Research has shown that if you drink fewer than two standard-size drinks each day, your odds of getting cataracts may be lower than if you never drank at all.

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, about 10% of cataract cases can be attributed to UV exposure. It’s thought that the eye’s lens absorbs UV light. A 2014 study published in Journal of Biological Chemistry found that UV light harms lens proteins, causing damaging oxidative reactions, possibly leading to cataract formation. “Wearing sunglasses to prevent premature cataract formation is a good idea,” says Jessica S.

When most people think about sun-related damage, they probably worry about their skin. But the sun’s ultraviolet rays also pose a threat to a person’s eyes. According to a 2014 study funded by the U.S. National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, UV radiation can damage proteins in the eye’s lens. Over time, this damage can raise a person’s risk for cataracts, which impair vision.","Markham Heid

HIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study Finds






Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuScienceNewsHIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study FindsResearchers have found new clues to the deadly disease's origins.ByStefan LovgrenPublished June 12, 2003• 7 min readShareTweetEmailScientists now say that the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which is believed to have been transmitted to humans to become HIV-1—the virus that causes AIDS—didn't start its life in chimps.Instead, it was a product of separate viruses jumping from different monkey species into chimps, where they recombined to form a hybrid virus, according to a new study.Researchers believe the chimpanzee virus is a hybrid of the SIVs naturally infecting two different monkeys, the red-capped mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) and the greater spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans). Chimps eat monkeys, which is likely how they acquired the monkey viruses. The hybrid virus then spread through the chimpanzee species, and was later transmitted to humans to become HIV-1.The study suggests striking parallels between SIV infection of chimps and HIV infection of humans. Just as chimps acquired viruses from two different sources, humans are infected by two distinct AIDS viruses: HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2, which humans acquired from sooty mangabey monkeys. ""Because of the similarity between chimpanzees and humans, any virus that successfully adapts to spreading among chimps would be a candidate for a further jump to humans—a potential HIV-3,"" said Paul Sharp of the Institute of Genetics at University of Nottingham in England, who led the study.The discovery also spotlights how many of our most virulent viruses were transmitted across species.

Studies show that HIV may have jumped from chimpanzees to humans as far back as the late 1800s. The chimpanzee version of the virus is called simian immunodeficiency virus. It was probably passed to humans when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came in contact with their infected blood. Over decades, HIV slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world.

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/history-of-aids," A person with AIDS is very vulnerable to cancer and to life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.Though there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, a person with HIV who receives treatment early can live nearly as long as someone without the virus. And a study in 2019 in the medical journal, Lancet, showed that an anti-viral treatment effectively halted the spread of HIV.Where Did AIDS Come From? Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then led to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home.",Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees,neutral,"

There are two types of HIV — HIV-1 and HIV-2 — and their exact origins differ according to the type.HIV-1 is a more virulent type, which means that it spreads easily. HIV-1 is the type of HIV that has a global presence. It originated in Central Africa.In contrast, HIV-2 is less virulent and not as common. It originated from West Africa.Both types relate to an immunodeficiency virus, called SIV, that is present in a type of chimpanzee.The CDC states that humans most likely contracted SIV after coming into contact with blood carrying the infection after hunting the chimpanzees for meat.Humans may have contracted HIV from chimpanzees as early as the 1800s.

 The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon.Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is picturedGroups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon.But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa.The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. HOW DID THE AIDS EPIDEMIC BEGIN? A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s.For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps.This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908.Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered.The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo.After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said.",AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,no,"

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hiv-origins-traced-to-monkey-virus/," But how chimps came to have SIV has been a mystery. American and English researchers analyzed the genetic pattern of a number of SIV strains in African monkeys and concluded that at least two strains found in the red-capped mangabeys and in the greater spot-nosed monkeys in south-central Africa combined to form the type of SIV now found in African chimps.It was this form of SIV that spread into the human population to start the HIV1 epidemic that has killed millions of people, researchers report Friday in the journal Science. ""The recombination of these monkey viruses happened in chimpanzees and the chimp transmitted it to humans on at least three occasions,"" said Frederic Bibollet-Ruche, a virologist at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and a co-author of the study. ""The transfer between chimps and humans probably happened before 1930. ""Bibollet-Ruche said that three types of HIV1, called M, N and O, probably were transmitted from chimps to humans decades ago. A second type of AIDs, called HIV2, is known to have been transmitted from the sooty mangabey in West Africa to humans directly, without going through the chimp.Monkeys and chimps both represent a reservoir of SIV viruses that could, in theory, be spread to humans, forming a new type of immunodeficiency disease, he said.The viruses were most likely spread from species to species when chimps eat monkey meat and hunters in Africa eat chimp meat, Bibollet-Ruche said.",how chimps came to have SIV has been a mystery,neutral,"

SIV-infected chimpanzees have a death rate that is 10 to 16 times higher than their uninfected counterparts. The practice of hunting, butchering, and eating the meat of chimpanzees may have allowed transmission of the virus to humans, probably in the late 19th or early 20th century. The strain of SIV found in gorillas is known as SIVgor, and it is distinct from the strain found in chimpanzees. Because primates are suspected of being the source of HIV, AIDS is considered a zoonosis, an infection that is shared by humans and other vertebrate animals.

Did AIDS come from chimps?,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html," The majority of HIV researchers subscribe to the bushmeat theory and raise several arguments against the OPV theory. Hahn's recent research confirming that HIV-1 M and N arose from Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps in Cameroon presents one problem: The Kisangani lab is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it's home to a different subspecies of chimp than the one that was the source of HIV-1 M and N. However, it is possible that the chimps used in the Kisangani experiments were not from the area. In the spring of 2006, Hooper found a paper indicating that at least one of eight chimps at the Kisangani lab was a Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The 1959 sample also presents a problem for the OPV theory. Judging by how fast the virus mutates, it had already diverged significantly from its SIV ancestors by the time doctors extracted it from a patient. However, the African polio vaccination program had begun only two years earlier, so under the OPV theory, the virus would have had only those two years in which to evolve.",Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps,neutral,"

The origin of the virus HIV-1, the main cause of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, has been a matter of debate ever since its discovery in 1983. Its origin in wild primates-the apes and monkeys-has long been accepted, but the question remained-which ones, and how could it have been transmitted? The first question is answered by a report in Nature: Beatrice H. Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and colleagues [from the USA, France and the UK] provide the most persuasive evidence yet that HIV-1 entered the human population from the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, our nearest living relative.From their analysis, it is now almost certain that HIV-1 entered the human population from chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which lives in equatorial west Africa, in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, where the HIV-1 virus is thought, on other evidence, to have emerged in humans.Chimpanzees, like many other primates, harbour simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). These closely resemble HIV but appear to co-exist far more successfully with their animal hosts, pointing to an ancient association between virus and host.",wild primates-the apes and monkeys,neutral,"

 The other lineages, 'M' and 'N', are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon.Group 'M' gave rise to the AIDS pandemic - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across Africa and throughout the rest of the world. Scientists found HIV-1 groups known as 'O' and 'P' originated in western lowland gorillas. A conceptual image of a HIV infected cell is picturedGroups 'N' and 'P', at the other extreme, have only been found in a few individuals from Cameroon.But 'O' - although not as widespread and prevalent as 'M' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west central Africa.The team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda for evidence of SIV strains - the pre-cursors of HIV. HOW DID THE AIDS EPIDEMIC BEGIN? A new book claims the AIDS epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern Cameroon in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s.For the book, which is subtitled 'How AIDS emerged from an African forest', David Quammen traced the history of AIDS by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps.This led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of Cameroon sometime around 1908.Quammen theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV by a chimp he killed and butchered.The hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the Sangha River in that matter until it reached the city of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Congo.After reaching the Congo, the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics, Mr Quammen said.",AIDS may have originated from western lowland gorillas in Cameroon,no,"

HIV's Jump From Apes to Humans May Have Been Aided by an Unfortunate Deficiency

Health22 December 2017By Mike McRae

Nobody knows quite when it happened. But some time in our not too distant past, a chimpanzee version of a pathogen known as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) jumped species to infect humans. Mutations in SIVcpz would turn it into the insidious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) responsible for the global AIDS epidemic. New research suggests a common group of proteins should have protected us from infection, raising the question - how did it happen?An international team led by researchers from the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf have investigated how a group of proteins called cellular cytidine deaminases (APOBEC3s or A3s in short) can offer humans protection from the virus that attacks apes.Specifically, the scientists focussed on variants of a gene responsible for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3H (A3H) and its role in the replication and possible transmission of the chimpanzee-specific virus.The story of the rise of the HIV epidemic is murky up to the point when the first AIDS patients were reported in the US in the early 1980s. While researchers can show a relationship with the simian version of the immunodeficiency virus, we can only speculate on how and when the virus leapt from apes to humans.The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat, probably captured for food, and occurred far enough back in recent history for the virus to have had time to evolve into its current form.Exactly why it happened at that moment – whether due to mutations or an unfortunate series of events – is still something of a mystery. But this new study could help shed some light on the question.It's known that the A3H cytidine deaminase proteins restrict the replication of the family of viruses both HIV and SIV belong to.Usually these viruses can retaliate with a secret weapon of their own – a protective virulence factor called vif.",The transmission was more than likely passed through infected blood from meat,neutral,"

""There have been suspicions that chimps at Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania contracted polio from humans, Leendertz said.There have also been concerns that gorillas contracted yaws, a disease related to syphilis that is not sexually transmitted, from humans, Leendertz added.Gorillas and chimpanzees in West Africa have been killed by outbreaks of anthrax. This may have originated from cattle herded by humans, although Leendertz noted these may have been natural events that just exist there in the forests.Although research and ecotourism efforts have brought people into greater contact with endangered great apes in the wild, potentially threatening the primates, ""research and tourism has a strong positive effect on great apes' survival since it reduces poaching activities in these areas and gives more 'political weight' to the apes and protected areas,"" Leendertz added.Indeed, studies suggest the protective effect researchers have against poachers outweighed the substantial chimpanzee death rate caused by human diseases, said Christophe Boesch of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. ""However, it comes with some hygienic problems which need to be addressed,"" he added.Keeping a distanceThe scientists have already stepped up guidelines to help minimize the risk of infection to chimpanzees, and they urge others to do the same. For example, Leendertz said, he and his colleagues now wear masks, keep a distance of at least 20 feet from the chimps, and disinfect their boots regularly. ""We need to be much more proactive about instituting strict hygiene precautions at all ape tourism and research sites,"" Leendertz said.","HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, originated from chimps",neutral,"

HIV is very similar to a virus called SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), which is found in monkeys. There’s now good evidence that it jumped species to humans, probably in the late 19th or early 20th century. The most common theory suggests that this happened during hunting and butchering of primates such as chimpanzees.",butchering of primates,no,"

Drinking too much water can cause dizziness, confusion, and nausea when your intake exceeds what your kidneys can eliminate through urination. On rare occasions, severe fluid overload, or water intoxication, can even be fatal. Too much water dilutes the amount of sodium in the blood needed for the body to function normally. Low sodium levels, known as hyponatremia, can affect many organ systems, most predominately the central nervous system. Drinking too much water is rarely a problem for healthy people, but you don't have to have an underlying kidney condition for this to affect you.

Ayurvedic practitioners also believe that warm or hot water helps to ease digestion.In Western medicine, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that cold water is bad for the body or digestion. Drinking plenty of water can help the body flush out toxins, aid digestion, and prevent constipation.A small study from 2013 investigated the effects of drinking water at different temperatures in six people who were dehydrated, following mild exercise, in a hot and humid chamber.The researchers found that changing the water temperature affected the sweating response of the participants and how much water they drank. The optimal water temperature in the study was 16°C (60.8°F), which is the temperature of cool tap water because the participants drank more water and sweated less.The researchers concluded that drinking water at 16°C may be the best temperature for rehydration in dehydrated athletes.Risks of drinking cold waterSome research suggests that people with conditions that affect the esophagus, or food pipe, such as achalasia, should avoid drinking cold water. Achalasia is a rare condition that can make swallowing food and drink difficult.A 2012 study found that drinking cold water worsened symptoms in people with achalasia. However, when participants drank hot water, it helped soothe and relax the food pipe, making food and drink easier to swallow.One 2001 study involving 669 women suggests that drinking cold water may cause headaches in some people.The researchers reported that 7.6 percent of participants experienced a headache after drinking 150 milliliters of ice-cold water through a straw.",PinterestThere is no evidence that drinking cold water is bad for health,neutral,"

Doctors call this imbalance “hyponatremia,” and in some cases it can be deadly. In this scenario, sports drinks and other beverages that contain nutrients and sodium are safer than plain water. While hyponatremia and excessive water consumption aren’t big concerns for non-athletes, there are better ways to keep the body and brain hydrated than to pound water all day long.

If you consume too much water, there may not be enough of these electrolytes in your body to keep it functioning properly. Here are a few signs your water intake may be too high. Keep in mind that while some of the symptoms listed below could be attributed to overhydration, they could also be the result of other medical conditions or issues. When in doubt, consult with your doctor.You're drinking water even when you're not thirstySome experts believe that many people meet their daily water needs by simply letting their thirst tell them when to drink.So if you're chugging water even when you're not thirsty, you could be drinking more than your body needs.Though it's important to increase your water intake if you're engaging in strenuous physical activity or outside in hot weather, allow your natural thirst to be your guide in most situations. Your urine is clearYou might know that dark-colored urine can be a sign of dehydration, but that doesn't mean you should aim to produce urine that's clear.According to Healthline, pale-yellow urine that looks like lemonade indicates a healthy level of hydration.Colorless urine, on the other hand, might mean you are overhydrated and need to reduce your water intake.You have a lingering headache and experience nauseaAccording to WebMD, drinking too much water can cause the sodium levels in your blood to drop, which can lead to headaches and nausea.",Drinking too much water can cause side effects,neutral,"

People who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), should consider avoiding carbonated beverages as a lifestyle modification to avoid making their symptoms worse. Water IntoxicationAlthough drinking water is encouraged as a healthy lifestyle choice, it is possible — though unlikely — for you to drink too much. Drinking a lot of water quickly can dilute the amount of sodium in your body. Sodium is an electrolyte that helps regulate the water in your cells, and too much water can lead to an imbalance, creating a condition called hyponatremia. It’s rare, but water intoxication can lead to comas and seizures and can prove fatal.Amounts and DosageAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for water to be labeled as mineral water, it must contain between 1,500 milligrams per liter of total dissolved minerals.",it is possible — though unlikely,neutral,"

Is too much water bad for you?,https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/how-much-water-is-too-much," There's no specific amount of water that is too much, it depends on factors like age and overall health. Drinking water is essential to keeping the body healthy and functioning properly. However, there's such a thing as drinking too much water too fast, aka water intoxication.Water intoxication occurs when you drink so much water that the kidneys can't eliminate it fast enough, so it begins to dilute electrolytes — primarily sodium — in the blood. Although it's rare, water intoxication can lead to death if not treated immediately.Here are the symptoms of water intoxication and how it is generally treated. How much is too much water?Water intoxication is a dangerous and severe condition because blood sodium levels drop rapidly, causing neurologic changes like hallucinations and confusion.Important: Drinking too much water can lead to hyponatremia, which occurs when blood sodium levels drop below 134 mEq/L. There are some instances where hyponatremia poses no immediate threat to a person's health.",Water intoxication is a dangerous and severe condition,yes,"

Other bodily fluids, such as tears, saliva, and sweat, do not transmit the virus.How is HIV transmitted from person to person?HIV is transmitted when a person who has measurable amounts of the virus in their body passes fluids directly into the bloodstream or through mucous membranes, cuts, or open sores of a person without HIV.Let’s explore the most common ways that HIV is transmitted.SexHIV exposure can occur during sexual intercourse. Both anal sex and vaginal sex have risks of HIV transmission.Receptive anal sex has the highest risk of transmission among sexual activity. There may be a number of reasons why, including that bleeding is more likely during anal sex due to the fragile tissues that line the anus and anal canal. This allows the virus to enter the body more easily, even if visible bleeding isn’t observed, as breaks in anal mucosa may be microscopic.While vaginal sex possibly carries less risk of transmission than anal sex, either partner can contract HIV in this way. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people with a vagina who contract HIV get it from vaginal sex.Sharing injection drug equipmentSharing needles for injecting drugs transmits HIV most efficiently.",do not transmit the virus,no,"

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000594.htm," When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk of getting life-threatening infections and cancers. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS. Once a person has the virus, it stays inside the body for life. Causes

 The virus is spread (transmitted) person-to-person through certain body fluids:BloodSemen and preseminal fluidRectal fluidsVaginal fluidsBreast milkHIV can be spread if these fluids come in contact with:Mucous membranes (inside of the mouth, penis, vagina, rectum)Damaged tissue (tissue that has been cut or scraped)Injection into the blood streamHIV cannot be spread through sweat, saliva, or urine.In the United States, HIV is mainly spread:Through vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or is not taking medicines to prevent or treat HIVThrough needle sharing or other equipment used to inject drugs with someone who has HIVLess often, HIV is spread:From mother to child.

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chances-of-getting-hiv," An HIV infection can eventually lead to AIDS if a person does not receive treatment.HIV affects people of all ages, races, and ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds.Of the 38 million people worldwide living with HIV in 2020:36 million were adults1.7 million were children under the age of 1520.6 million lived in eastern and southern Africa4.7 million lived in western and central Africa5.7 million lived in Asia and the Pacific2.2 million lived in Europe and North AmericaLearn more about HIV and AIDS here.How is HIV transmitted?HIV can transmit through different bodily fluids, including:bloodsemen and pre-seminal fluidvaginal secretionsrectal fluidsbreast milkHIV transmission only occurs if the bodily fluids of a person with detectable levels of HIV enter the bloodstream of a person who does not have HIV. HIV can enter the bloodstream through:cuts or broken skinopen soresdirect injectionmucous membranes, such as those found in the mouth, rectum, vagina, and tip of the penisHIV can also pass from the biological parent to the child during pregnancy. This is called vertical transmission.HIV is not transmitted through:insectsair or watersaliva, tears, or sweattoilet seatsday-to-day contact, such as shaking hands, hugging, or kissingChances of contracting HIVSome activities carry a higher chance of contracting HIV than others.Anal sexThe CDC notes that anal intercourse, regardless of a person’s gender identity or sexual orientation, is the riskiest type of sex for HIV transmission.The chance of contracting HIV via anal sex is as follows:receptive anal intercourse: 1.38%insertive anal intercourse: 0.11%Although both can contract HIV via anal sex, the receptive partner has a higher chance. This is because the lining of the rectum is thin and easily injured.The insertive partner may contract HIV via the urethra or small cuts, scratches, and open sores on the penis.Having a rectal infection like herpes may also increase the risk of transmission.Vaginal sexEither sexual partner can contract HIV via vaginal sex.HIV can be contracted through the lining of the vagina and cervix if their sexual partner’s bodily fluids, such as semen and pre-seminal fluid, carry HIV.Limited research is available on the rates of HIV transmission via insertive penile sex in a neovagina.HIV can also be contracted from the vaginal fluid and blood through the opening of the penis, the foreskin, and small cuts and scratches or open sores.The chances of contracting HIV via vaginal sex are as follows:receptive penile-vaginal intercourse: 0.08%insertive penile-vaginal intercourse: 0.04%Having a vaginal infection may also increase the risk of transmission.Oral sexThe CDC note that there is little to no risk of contracting HIV via oral sex. Mouth-to-penis oral sex may carry the highest chance of transmitting HIV, but the chances are still very low.Factors that may increase the chance of contracting HIV via oral sex include:sores on the vagina, mouth, or penisbleeding gumsoral contact with menstrual bloodthe presence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)Other sexual activitiesAlthough it is possible to transmit HIV through the following activities, the chance is low:Fingering: To lessen the chance of transmission, a person should ensure they have clean hands and trimmed fingernails so as not to damage the wall of the anus or vagina.Sex toy use: HIV transmission is possible through sharing sex toys, such as dildos, vibrators, and butt plugs. A person should clean their sex toys between each use and avoid sharing them.Transmitted during pregnancyResearch has found that the rate of transmission during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breastfeeding or chestfeeding is 15-45% without any medical intervention.However, the risk is even lower if the pregnant person takes antiretroviral (ART) drugs during the pregnancy and breastfeeding or chestfeeding.Transmission through needlesHIV transmission through needles occurs when a person who does not have HIV uses the same needle or syringe as someone who is HIV positive.Used syringes usually contain residual fluid, such as blood, on the needle or nozzle.",tears,neutral,"

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324052," In extremely rare cases, HIV may spread if blood comes into contact with an open wound. There is a chance of this occurring if partners engage in open-mouth kissing, and both have bleeding gums or open sores within the mouth.However, saliva that does not contain blood cannot transmit HIV. People cannot get HIV from closed-mouth or cheek kissing.People can reduce or eliminate the chance of contracting HIV by using barrier contraceptives or taking preventive HIV therapy, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).PrEP is a pill that a person can take once a day to minimize the chance of contracting HIV. It may be helpful for those who:have a partner with HIVhave a partner with an unknown HIV statushave multiple partnersshare needles to inject drugsRead more about HIV transmission here.How HIV cannot spreadIt is not possible to contract HIV from the following:mosquito and tick bitessexual activities that do not involve the exchange of bodily fluids, such as mutual masturbationcontact with the saliva, tears, or sweat of a person with HIVhugging, cheek kissing, or shaking hands with someone with HIVsharing toilets or cutleryMany myths and much misinformation surrounds the transmission of HIV. Read more here.SummaryHIV cannot survive for long outside the human body, which means that the risk of contracting HIV from dried blood or semen is low. If a person suspects that they have come into contact with HIV in the last 72 hours, they can use an emergency prevention method called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).Find out how to undergo testing for HIV in the U.S. here.Although inequities exist between different regions and populations, modern antiretroviral therapy has made it possible for people with HIV to live long, healthy lives without the virus transmitting to others.","tears, or sweat of a person with HIVhugging",neutral,"

For transmission to occur, the fluid must come into contact with damaged tissue, the bloodstream, or mucous membranes, such as those in the genitals, rectum, or mouth.If blood containing HIV comes into direct contact with another person’s bloodstream, such as through an injection with a shared needle, this is very likely to transmit the virus.HIV can transmit to a baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. However, this is less common due to modern preventive measures and treatments.What does not transmit the virus?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV cannot transmit through:insect bites, including those from mosquitoes and ticksthe aircontact with saliva, tears, or sweatshaking hands, hugging, or closed-mouth kissingsharing toilets, dishes, or utensilseating food that someone with HIV has handled or preparedsexual activities that do not involve fluid exchange, such as touchingHIV cannot survive long outside the body, so it does not transmit via surfaces.Additionally, the risks of contracting the virus through other methods of exposure, such as biting, scratching, and thrown bodily fluids, are either very small or nonexistent.There is also little to no risk of contracting HIV via:Oral sex: However, having mouth ulcers, genital sores, or bleeding gums can increase the risk of transmission, as can having existing sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Workplace exchanges: However, a puncture from a needle or another sharp object that contains the virus can lead to transmission.Blood transfusion or donated organs: Current screening practices in the U.S. are safe and undergo stringent regulation, making this transmission highly unlikely.Deep, open-mouth kissing: Transmission in this way is very rare, but it can occur if both people have oral sores or bleeding gums.Tattoos and body piercings: There have been no reports of transmission from tattoos or piercings in the U.S., although it is possible if the equipment or ink has been in contact with someone else’s blood.For more in-depth information and resources on HIV and AIDS, visit our dedicated hub.Risk factorsAnyone can contract HIV, but several factors increase the risk. These include:sharing equipment for injecting drugs getting a tattoo with a shared needle or shared inkhaving anal or vaginal sex without a condomhaving an STIhaving frequent exposure to fluids containing the virus, such as in laboratory, medical, or emergency settingsusing drugs and alcohol, which can impair judgmenthaving exposure to the virus during childbirth, pregnancy, or breastfeedingHIV affects certain populations more than others in the U.S., including: Black and Latinx peoplecisgender and transgender males who have sex with cisgender malestransgender femalesIn 2019, the latest year for which figures are available, males who had sex with other males received 65% of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. Anal sex without a condom was the most likely route of transmission because the risk of tissue damage is high.HIV also affects more people who are Black or Latinx due to systemic inequity in healthcare and social and economic marginalization as well as other ingrained barriers. In 2019, Black people received 41% of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., while Hispanic and Latino individuals received 29% of those diagnoses, and white people received 25%.The prevalence of HIV differs by region of the U.S. In 2019, the South had the largest number of people living with HIV and the highest rate of new cases.",hands,neutral,"

Can HIV be transmitted through sweat?,https://www.medicinenet.com/can_i_get_hiv_from_surfaces/article.htm," Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the possible ways through which the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads from one person to another. These studies proved that HIV cannot be transmitted through surfaces such as toilet seats, chairs, doorknobs, drinking glasses, and bedsheets. The virus cannot survive outside a human host; hence, transmission through air, water (swimming pools), insect bites,s or casual contact such as handshakes, hugs or touch is not possible. No case of passing the infection through scratching or dry blood has been ever documented. Although trace amounts of HIV are found in saliva, sweat, human waste, and tears, the viral load is too low to infect another person. Laboratory-grown HIV when placed on a surface tends to dry over the next few hours and becomes noninfective by more than 90 percent, causing little to no risk of infecting another person.How well does HIV survive outside the body?",the viral load is too low to infect another person,neutral,"

Can a woman get pregnant while breastfeeding?,https://www.shecares.com/pregnancy/getting-pregnant-while-breastfeeding," Some women who are nursing might ovulate before their first post-partum menses, while others might start having periods but without ovulation. Although breastfeeding is known to temporarily suppress menstruation, there is no way to know for sure for when a woman's ovulation will return.Certain milestone moments, such as introducing the newborn to solid food or longer sleep intervals at nighttime, might be interpreted by the body as a reduced milk demand, triggering ovulation sooner. Chances of Pregnancy while Breastfeeding   PinA woman's odds of getting pregnant while breastfeeding hugely depend on its patterns, most importantly the frequency and total amount of time the baby is at the breast in 24 hours. Generally, the more a woman nurses, the less likely she is to ovulate.There are two types of breastfeeding patterns that are commonly used to naturally space pregnancies, exclusive and ecological breastfeeding.Exclusive BreastfeedingAlso called Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM), the chances of pregnancy while exclusively breastfeeding are 1-2%, which means that one to two women out of a 100 will get pregnant. On average, it takes six months for menstruation and full fertility to return while on this type of breastfeeding.The LAM conditions include the following:Baby is under the age of six monthsBaby is only fed breast milk straight from the breast (no water, etc. )A woman's period has not returned after two months since birthEcological BreastfeedingEcological breastfeeding consists of The Seven Standards, a set of conditions that have to be followed in order to maintain a fertility-free life.The chances of pregnancy while breastfeeding ecologically are near zero during the first three months.",PinA woman's odds of getting pregnant while breastfeeding hugely depend on its patterns,yes,"

Although breastfeeding offers some protection from ovulation, the monthly occurrence where you release a mature egg from one of your ovaries, it is possible to ovulate and become pregnant prior to getting your first period.The key players here are the hormones oxytocin and prolactin, which are responsible for milk production and the let-down reflex. Increased levels of these hormones actually suppress the brain from making the main hormone that stimulates the ovary to grow an egg each month. When a mother is breastfeeding exclusively, or even on a consistent basis, it is less likely that she is going to ovulate at all until she starts to wean.That doesn’t mean that you won’t ovulate or conceive. The ""protective"" effect of breastfeeding becomes progressively less effective the longer it's been since you delivered your baby.

But the ovaries release an egg before a period starts so a person may be fertile for at least a few weeks before there are any obvious signs.

Many women worry about breastfeeding while pregnant as breastfeeding can cause mild uterine contractions. However, in a healthy pregnancy, these contractions are not a concern, as they generally do not cause preterm labor. This is because oxytocin, the hormone released during breastfeeding that stimulates contractions, is usually released in such a small amount during breastfeeding that is not enough to cause preterm labor.

As described in The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, the Lactation Amenorrhea Method of using breastfeeding to delay fertility needs all the following to be true:

Your periods have not returned. Your baby is exclusively and frequently fed from your breasts- this is especially important to remember when your little one begins sleeping through the night.

After about six months, once solids are introduced in her baby’s diet the contraceptive effect can no longer be guaranteed and a mother could get pregnant while she is still breastfeeding. For some mothers, the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding may carry on for longer, especially if breastfeeding happens at least every four hours in the day and six hours at night and is offered before complementary foods are given (ABM, 2015).

Can a Woman Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding? Breastfeeding and LactationWellness for Moms



Jan 7

Written By Leva App





By Alison Heyerdahl











For most parents, the thought of getting pregnant soon after welcoming their new baby into the world can be unnerving. Instead of using contraceptives such as the pill or other birth control methods, some parents may wonder if breastfeeding may be enough of a protective measure to avoid pregnancy. Schedule time with a Lactation Consultant


How effective is breastfeeding for avoiding pregnancy?According to studies, breastfeeding affects fertility and provides a fairly robust form of temporary natural contraceptive. Known as the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), only 1 or 2 out of 100 women who exclusively breastfed (as opposed to supplementing with formula) in the first 6 months got pregnant following childbirth.","

In 2012, questions surfaced when the FDA issued a warning that statin users had reported short-term cognitive impairment when taking the drugs. A study published June 29, 2021, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) aimed to shed some additional light on this issue. Researchers looked at data on statin use among 18,446 people, ages 65 or older, who had taken part in a large randomized trial of aspirin. The researchers found that over a follow-up period of almost five years, people who took statins weren’t any more likely than non-users to have dementia. The same was true when it came to other changes in cognition, memory, language, executive function, or a measure called psychomotor speed, which measures how quickly someone can process information.",dementia,neutral,"

Paradoxically, statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. However, randomized controlled trials have similarly failed to find the beneficial effect. Supporting evidence for both claims is compelling whereas known limitations of the clinical trials may explain the lack of findings. This narrative review aims to explain why there is still controversy and how both effects can, and may, be possible.

Another possible explanation is a well-known phenomenon called detection bias.

For comparison, the RDA is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.At that time, no reliable studies had proved this to be true.But in the following few decades, multiple randomized controlled studies examined whether the vitamin had any effect on the common cold.The results have been fairly disappointing.An analysis of 29 studies including 11,306 participants concluded that supplementing with 200 mg or more of vitamin C did not reduce the risk of catching a cold (1).However, regular vitamin C supplements had several benefits, including:Reduced cold severity: They reduced the symptoms of a cold, making it less severe.Reduced cold duration: Supplements decreased recovery time by 8% in adults and 14% in children, on average.A supplemental dose of 1–2 grams was enough to shorten the duration of a cold by 18% in children, on average (1).Other studies in adults have found 6–8 grams per day to be effective (2).Vitamin C appears to have even stronger effects in people who are under intense physical stress. In marathon runners and skiers, vitamin C alantost halved the duration of the common cold (1).Summary Although vitamin C supplements have no effect on the risk of catching a cold, they appear to reduce its severity and duration.How Does Vitamin C Reduce the Severity of Colds?Vitamin C is an antioxidant and necessary to produce collagen in the skin.Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, keeping skin and various tissues tough but flexible.A vitamin C deficiency results in a condition known as scurvy, which isn’t really a problem today, as most people get enough vitamin C from foods.However, it’s less known that vitamin C is also highly concentrated in immune cells and quickly depleted during an infection (3).In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens the immune system and increases the risk of infections (4).For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during an infection is a good idea.Summary Vitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells. It is depleted during infections, so a vitamin C deficiency may increase their risk.Other Nutrients and Foods That May HelpThere is no cure for the common cold.However, some foods and nutrients can help the body recover.",HelpThere is no cure for the common cold,neutral,"

    Can vitamin C prevent a cold? October 13, 2020


The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power.Image: Wavebreakmedia Ltd/Thinkstock Vitamin C is often touted as a natural cold remedy. The nutrient is featured in supplements promising to boost the immune system. Nobel laureate Dr. Linus Pauling famously claimed that taking large doses of vitamin C helps thwart a cold. Is there something to these claims? ""The data show that vitamin C is only marginally beneficial when it comes to the common cold,"" says Dr. Bruce Bistrian, chief of clinical nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.About vitamin COur bodies don't make vitamin C, but we need it for immune function, bone structure, iron absorption, and healthy skin.",The nutrient appears to have modest prevention power,neutral,"

Does Vitamin C prevent colds?,https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/vitamin-c-for-common-cold," But findings have been inconsistent. Overall, experts have found little to no benefit from vitamin C for preventing or treating the common cold. In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shortened cold duration -- by 8% in adults and by 14% in children.In 2010, researchers looked at all studies and found that taking vitamin C every day did not prevent the number of colds that a person got. In some cases, it made symptoms improve.The results were different for people who were in very good physical condition, such as marathon runners.",did not prevent the number of colds,neutral,"

But doing so did shorten the amount of time that people were ill by about 10 percent. In other words, a cold that would have lasted ten days was over in nine days. The cold symptoms were also a bit milder in people who always took vitamin C. These results have now been confirmed by other researchers as well, especially regarding use in children. It didn’t shorten the length of colds in men and women who started taking it only after they became ill.Some of the studies looked at whether vitamin C can prevent colds in people exposed to short periods of very strenuous physical activity, often in connection with extremely cold temperatures. Examples include marathon runners or soldiers doing winter exercises in a mountainous region.The study participants started taking vitamin C two to three weeks before the very strenuous activities, with the aim of preventing colds.",it wasn't possible to prevent colds,no,"

Ah, autumn: Time for leaf-peeping, pumpkin spice lattes, turtlenecks … and the sniffles.Fall and winter are peak seasons for colds. And almost everybody from Aunt Gladys to the cashier at the grocery store wants to tell you about their magic bullet for fighting wintertime bugs. One of the most popular word-of-mouth cold remedies is to dose up on vitamin C.But does boosting your vitamin C intake do anything to prevent or shorten colds?Some studies suggest taking vitamin C has a modest effect on the common cold, but don't expect miracles, one expert says. ""It's fair to say that vitamin C supplementation both shortens duration of cold and offers some protection against colds, though it's not very dramatic,"" said Stephen Lawson, a researcher at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University, who studies micronutrients. [Myth or Truth: 7 Ancient Health Ideas Explained]Vitamin CVitamin C gained its reputation as an almost miraculous substance after two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling first touted the benefits of the micronutrient in a series of books, with titles such as ""Vitamin C and the Common Cold,"" (W.H.",shortens duration of cold and offers some protection against colds,neutral,"

In a study by researchers at the University of Toronto, subjects were divided into two groups: an experimental group that received vitamin C pills at the onset of cold symptoms, and a control group that received placebo pills.

One study, for example, found that in the three hours after consuming coffee, metabolic rates were significantly higher in those who drank coffee than those who did not. Another common belief is that caffeine boosts your energy level.

Coffee is a great way to start your morning and the hot mug warms up your hands when it’s cold outside. But could the caffeine in that cup also help you lose weight? Claims of Weight Loss With Caffeine  

When it comes to the connection between caffeine and weight loss, there are three common claims:



Research suggests that consuming caffeine can jumpstart your metabolism and help you burn fat. One study, for example, found that in the three hours after consuming coffee, metabolic rates were significantly higher in those who drank coffee than those who did not. Another common belief is that caffeine boosts your energy level. The theory here is that the energy boost will make you more motivated to exercise, help you exercise for a longer time, or both.", caffeine,neutral,"

Can coffee help you lose weight?,https://www.adamkempfitness.com/best-weight-loss-coffee/," Coffee Will Help You Maintain Your Weight Loss
One of the most significant problems with many weight loss efforts is that the weight loss is not permanent, and you end up gaining even more weight once you finish the restrictive dieting or weight loss program. However, drinking coffee for weight loss is a different approach, and research has indicated that drinking coffee is related to sustained weight loss! One of the reasons coffee is great for losing weight is because it fits well within most people’s lifestyles and probably even is already a part of yours! According to a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, individuals who maintained weight loss after a period of weight loss reported significantly higher consumption of coffee and caffeinated beverages than the general population. Along with caffeine, coffee has multiple other compounds such as chlorogenic acids and mannooligosaccharides that have several important metabolic effects that may explain these results.

Coffee is your go-to drink in the morning (and maybe throughout the rest of the day, too)—but if you get off track with your weight loss goals every time you start drinking it regularly, you may feel like it's becoming a frustrating case of what we call, deja brew. In and of itself, coffee has plenty of perks: Research shows that it may help you live longer, enable your body to process glucose (sugar) better, and decrease your risk of health issues like Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer, and heart failure, per Johns Hopkins Medicine. However, it's what you mix into it—as well as pair it with—that can quickly derail healthy eating habits. ""I think coffee itself is fine, but it gets a bad reputation because we tend to consume excess fat, calories, and sugar with our coffee,"" says Adriana Sobel, MS, RD, CDN, clinical dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center.",Making small adjustments to your java routine can help you reach your goal weight,neutral,"

You may have heard caffeine speeds up your metabolism, but does coffee help you lose weight? Caffeine is often added to supplements that claim they can help you drop pounds but is there any evidence to back these claims up? When it comes to the connection between caffeine and weight loss, there are three common claims. These are that caffeine will help you burn fat by speeding up your metabolism, secondly, that it boosts your energy for exercise, and finally, that it suppresses your appetite. We talked to a nutritionist and looked at the research to discover if coffee does help you lose weight, how it really affects your metabolism, and the long-term effects of drinking coffee.Before you chug a cup of strong coffee and jump on one of the best exercise machines to lose weight, we’ve got the bottom of whether coffee really does help you lose weight or not.",does coffee help you lose weight,yes,"

Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://sweatguy.com/does-lemon-water-burn-belly-fat/," Undoubtedly, lemon water can help you reach you some fitness goals. But solely using this citrus fruit with H2O is no cure for your stubborn belly fat. So, why use lemon water for weight loss then? But when you use it as a replacement for your daily sugary beverages, juices, and soda filled with calories, there’s no doubt that it brings about drastic changes in your weight.",no cure,no,"

no.
"
Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://trainerjosh.com/nutrition/how-make-lemon-water/," In addition, those with abdominal fat are more likely to suffer from insulin resistance, making them even more likely to have belly fat (9). Therefore, it’s critical to lower insulin levels and prevent blood sugar spikes to lose belly fat. So drinking lemon water doesn’t directly help you lose weight by burning calories, but it does promote healthy weight loss and help get rid of belly flab. This is because you have to lower insulin to shrink fat cells in your belly, and drinking lemon water will help you do just this despite how many calories you’re consuming. How Long Does It Take for Lemon Water to Reduce Belly Fat

Just by adding some lemon water to your morning routine, you can expect to see a reduction in belly fat and weight loss. How long this will take will depend on how much you have to lose in the first place.",it does promote healthy weight loss and help get rid of belly flab,neutral,"

     Tip Lemon juice doesn't burn belly fat, although it can play a role in helping you reduce your calorie intake. Low-Calorie Lemon Water
  The juice from one-half lemon contains just 5 calories, according to the USDA. That means it's basically a guilt-free way to make water more appealing, make a zesty salad dressing, marinate a chicken breast or wake up a filet of fish. Compare that to tasty yet fat and calorie-laden dressings and store-bought marinades and flavored waters. Video of the Day
      But besides being flavorful and nearly calorie-free, lemon juice doesn't have any special effects on fat burning. Some health and nutrition faddists claim that drinking a glass of lemon water first thing in the morning can jumpstart your metabolism for increased fat burning, but there is no scientific evidence to support this.",doesn't burn belly fat,neutral,"
no.
"
Does drinking lemon water help with belly fat?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lemon-water-for-weight-loss," Drinking it instead of higher-calorie beverages could help contribute to weight loss.It Can Keep You Hydrated From carrying nutrients to cells to transporting waste out of the body, drinking enough water to stay hydrated is a critical component of health.Maintaining adequate hydration is essential in everything from regulating body temperature to improving physical performance (5).Some evidence also suggests that staying hydrated can aid in weight loss.Research indicates that increased hydration may increase the breakdown of fats and enhance fat loss (6).Staying well-hydrated may also help reduce water retention, which can cause symptoms like bloating, puffiness and weight gain (7).Since the majority of lemon water is made up of water, it can help with maintaining adequate hydration.Summary: Drinking lemon water could help you stay hydrated, which reduces water retention and may increase fat loss.Drinking Lemon Water May Boost Metabolism Studies show that drinking enough water can potentially help increase your metabolism.Researchers suggest that good hydration enhances the function of mitochondria, a type of organelle found in cells that helps generate energy for the body (6).This leads to an increase in metabolism, which may lead to subsequent weight loss.Drinking water has also been shown to increase metabolism by inducing thermogenesis, a metabolic process in which calories are burned to produce heat.In one study, 14 participants drank 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water. Drinking water was found to increase their metabolic rate by 30% for 30–40 minutes (8).Another study looked at the effects of drinking water in 21 overweight children. Drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased metabolism by an impressive 25% for 40 minutes (9).Research on lemon water specifically is limited. However, because water is the main ingredient, it likely carries the same metabolism-boosting benefits as regular water.Summary: Studies show that drinking water could increase metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial function and inducing thermogenesis.Lemon Water Can Make You Feel More Full Drinking water is often recommended as a fundamental part of any weight loss regimen, as it can promote satiety and fullness without adding calories.A 2008 study looked at the effects of water on calorie intake in 24 overweight and obese older adults.The study revealed that drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water before breakfast decreased the number of calories consumed in the meal by 13% (10).Another study found that drinking water with a meal decreased hunger and increased satiety during the meal (11).Because lemon water is low in calories and can promote fullness in the same way as regular water, it can be an effective way to help reduce calorie intake.Summary: Regular water and lemon water can help promote satiety and fullness, which may decrease calorie intake and lead to weight loss.It Could Increase Weight Loss Due to its potential beneficial effects on metabolism, satiety and hydration, some evidence suggests that water (including lemon water) could enhance weight loss.In one study, 48 adults were assigned to two diets: a low-calorie diet with 16.9 oz (0.5 liters) of water prior to each meal or a low-calorie diet with no water before meals.At the end of the 12-week study, participants in the water group had lost 44% more weight than participants in the non-water group (12).Other research suggests that increasing water intake could help stimulate weight loss, independent of diet or exercise.A 2009 study measured water intake in 173 overweight women. It found that greater water intake was associated with a greater loss of body weight and fat over time, regardless of diet or physical activity (13).Though these studies focus specifically on regular water, the same results most likely apply to lemon water as well.Summary: Some studies suggest that drinking regular water or lemon water could increase weight loss, regardless of diet or exercise.Lemon Water Is Not Necessarily Better Than Regular Water Lemon water comes with a lot of potential benefits, from promoting hydration to increasing satiety.However, it’s important to note that these benefits all come from its main ingredient — water.Lemon water does contain some additional nutrients from the lemon juice, such as vitamin C and antioxidants, but these are unlikely to have any effect on your weight.Additionally, the alkalizing effect of lemon juice has no clear effects on weight.All that being said, lemon water may have some benefits for preventing kidney stones, due to the acids it contains (14, 15, 16) Summary: Lemon water may be beneficial for weight loss, but has no added benefits over regular water.How to Drink Lemon Water Lemon water is a highly customizable beverage and can be tailored based on personal preference.Recipes usually call for the juice from at least half a lemon mixed with a glass of water. To add more flavor, try adding in a few other ingredients.A few fresh mint leaves or a sprinkle of turmeric are delicious and healthy ways to spice up a glass of lemon water.Many people prefer to start their day with a refreshing glass of lemon water, but it can be enjoyed at any time of day.It can also be consumed hot, like tea, or with a few ice cubes added for a cool and invigorating drink.Despite claims that lemon water has greater benefits when consumed at certain temperatures, there is little evidence to support that it makes a difference.Summary: Lemon water can be customized based on personal preference, and it can be enjoyed hot or cold at any time of day.The Bottom Line Lemon water can promote fullness, support hydration, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.However, lemon water is no better than regular water when it comes to losing fat.That being said, it is tasty, easy to make and can be used as a low-calorie replacement for higher-calorie beverages.In this way, it could potentially help promote weight loss and improve health.Share this articleBy Rachael Link, MS, RD on June 11, 2017Read this nextCarbonated (Sparkling) Water: Good or Bad?By Franziska SpritzlerCarbonated (sparkling) water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas.",greater loss,neutral,"

Does deli meat increase your risk of colon cancer?,https://www.aicr.org/news/faq-processed-meat-and-cancer/," It’s not surprising since the headlines can change with every new study. So we put together some answers to your most-asked questions.What Are Processed Meats?AICR/WCRF’s expert report and its updates define processed meat as “meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives.” Ham, bacon, sausages, hot dogs and yes, deli meats, are all considered processed meat.How Does Processed Meat Affect Cancer Risk?The latest analysis of the global research found that eating even small amounts of cold cuts or other processed meats on a regular basis increases the risk of colorectal cancer.The report by AICR/WCRF also found that eating high amounts of red meat – over 18 ounces a week – linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer.In addition to its link to colorectal cancer, processed meat may also increase risk of heart disease.How Much Processed Meat Is Safe to Eat?Processed MeatsSausageBaconDeli meatsHot dogsHamPepperoniSalamiCorned beefResearch suggests that regularly eating even small amounts of cold cuts, bacon, sausage and hot dogs increase colorectal cancer risk, which is why AICR recommends avoiding these foods, except for special occasions.The risk continues to rise as processed meat consumption increases. Studies show that compared to eating no processed meat, eating 3.5 ounces every day – a large hot dog – increases colorectal cancer risk by 36%.Why Does Processed Meat Increase Cancer Risk?It’s not yet clear exactly why processed meats increase risk for colorectal cancer. Researchers are currently exploring a few possible mechanisms, including:Nitrates/Nitrites: These are added to processed meats to preserve color and prevent spoilage. In lab studies, these compounds form cancer-causing compounds, carcinogens.Smoking: Smoked meats contain PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons), substances that are formed at high-heat and considered carcinogenic.Cooking at high temperatures: Meats cooked at high temperatures can also contain PAHs and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which can damage DNA.Heme iron: The heme iron found in red meat may damage the lining of the colon.What about nitrate/nitrite-free turkey or other deli meats?These products are relatively new.

Are skin tags contagious?,https://www.getthegloss.com/article/skin-tags-what-they-are-what-causes-them-and-how-to-remove-them," Dr Suchitra Badvey , consultant dermatologist and specialist in dermatology and cosmetic dermatology at 25 Harley Street, explains how to identify a skin tag:
“Lots of people have skin tags- they’re small, soft, skin growths that hang off the skin. They’re generally flesh coloured and range from 1 mm to 5 cm in size. Most are harmless and nothing to worry about, although they can be a cosmetic bother, or rub against clothing or jewellery and become a real annoyance.”
Basically, if you’ve got something that looks like a  wart  but isn’t a wart (i.e, it’s smooth rather than rough and not contagious), it could be a skin tag, but always have it checked out by your GP or a dermatologist if you’re in any doubt. In very rare occasions, skin tags can be confused with a rare skin cancer known as a pinkus tumour which looks very similar. Skin tag in action

Can oil pulling heal cavities?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/oil-pulling-coconut-oil," It is claimed to reduce the risk of cavities, gum inflammation, and bad breath.Coconut oil pulling can reduce harmful bacteria in your mouthStreptococcus mutans is one of the main bacteria in your mouth and a key player in plaque buildup and tooth decay.One study in 60 adults showed that oil pulling with coconut oil for 10 minutes every day significantly reduced the number of S. mutans in saliva in as little as 2 weeks, compared to distilled water (2).Another study in children concluded that coconut oil was as effective as a standard chlorhexidine mouthwash at reducing S. mutans (3).While these results are promising, more studies are needed comparing the effectiveness of coconut oil to other types of oils.SummaryUsing coconut oil as a mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of harmful bacteria, such as S. mutans, in your mouth.Oil pulling can reduce plaque and gingivitisGingivitis is caused by inflammation of the gums and occurs when your immune system starts attacking the bacteria in the plaque.One 2009 study in 20 adolescent boys with plaque-induced gingivitis compared the effects of sesame oil pulling and a standard chlorhexidine mouthwash.Both oil pulling and mouthwash were effective against gingivitis (4).Coconut oil has similar benefits. Another 1-month study in 60 adolescents found that daily coconut oil pulling significantly reduced markers of gingivitis (1).SummaryOil pulling with coconut oil may help reduce inflammation of the gums, also known as gingivitis.Oil pulling can reduce bad breathBad breath, otherwise known as halitosis, is in many cases caused by the smell of chemicals and gases produced by bacteria in your mouth (5).It’s associated with infections, gingivitis, and overall poor oral hygiene (5).It makes sense that if you get rid of some of these bacteria and improve your oral health, you reduce the likelihood of having bad breath.An older study in 20 adolescents showed that oil pulling with sesame oil significantly reduced all markers of bad breath and was as effective as a chlorhexidine mouthwash (6).More studies need to examine whether oil pulling with coconut oil has similar benefits for halitosis. But given that it may reduce plaque and gingivitis, it seems likely.SummarySome evidence suggests oil pulling with sesame oil reduces bad breath. Coconut oil may have the same effect.Unproven benefits and misconceptionsThere are many misconceptions about oil pulling.One common claim is that oil pulling can whiten your teeth. However, currently no studies confirm this benefit (7).Some people also believe that oil pulling is a type of detox that draws toxins from the blood. No evidence supports this idea.Finally, there is no scientific evidence that this remedy helps treat any diseases other than those affecting the mouth.SummaryThere are plenty of myths and misconceptions about oil pulling.",It is claimed to reduce the risk of cavities,neutral,"

    Misconception
  Common misconceptions about fiber include the belief that eating too much fiber causes you to experience more hemorrhoids, and that too much fiber causes difficult or excess bowel movements. The actual cause of these problems is constipation, the result of eating too much fiber without increasing your water intake. Fiber adds bulk to your stool and absorbs water, which makes it easier to move along your digestive tract. If you do not have enough fluids in your system, your stool dries out, you become constipated and increase your risk of hemorrhoids, or worsen an existing hemorrhoid problem. Advertisement

The interaction between citrus and medication depends on the individual drug, and not the class of the drug. Drugs that interact usually share three common features: they are taken orally, normally only a small amount enters systemic blood circulation, and they are metabolized by CYP3A4. [1] However, the effects on the CYP3A4 in the liver could in principle cause interactions with non-oral drugs,[citation needed] and non-CYP3A4-mediated effects also exist. [29]

Do bananas increase the risk of diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-diabetes," The larger the banana, the more carbs you’ll consume and the greater the rise in your blood sugar will be.Are bananas safe for those with diabetes?Most general dietary guidelines for diabetes recommend following a healthy, balanced diet that includes fruit (22, 23, 24).This is because eating fruits and vegetables has been linked to better health and a lower risk of conditions such as heart disease and some cancers (25, 26, 27, 28). People living with diabetes are at an even greater risk of these diseases, so eating enough fruits and vegetables is important (29, 30, 31, 32). Unlike refined sugar products such as candy and cake, the carbs in fruits like bananas come with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. More specifically, bananas provide fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C. They also contain some antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds (33).For most people with diabetes, fruits — including bananas — are a healthy choice.However, some people who are following low carb diets need to watch their total carbohydrate intake to stay within their daily carb allotment. This means foods higher in carbs, including bananas, have to be limited on low carb diets.If your doctor says you can eat bananas, it’s important to be mindful of the ripeness and size of a banana to reduce its effect on your blood sugar level.SummaryFruits like bananas are healthy foods that contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Regina Castro, M.D. It's a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat certain foods because they're ""too sweet."" Some fruits do contain more sugar than others, but that doesn't mean you can't eat them if you have diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates in a food affects blood sugar levels more than the source of the carbohydrates — or whether that carbohydrate source is a starch or sugar. As you decide what fruit to eat, keep in mind that one serving of fruit should contain no more than 15 grams of carbohydrates.

This is because they’re broken down into sugar, or glucose, and absorbed into your bloodstream.Carbs include starches, sugar, and fiber. However, fiber isn’t digested and instead absorbed by your body in the same way other carbs are, so it doesn’t raise your blood sugar.Subtracting fiber from the total carbs in a portion of food will give you its digestible or net carb content. For instance, if a cup of mixed vegetables contains 10 grams of carbs and 4 grams of fiber, its net carb count is 6 grams.When people with diabetes consume too many carbs at a time, their blood sugar levels can rise to dangerously high levels.Over time, high levels can damage your body’s nerves and blood vessels, which may set the stage for heart disease, kidney disease, and other serious health conditions.Maintaining a low carb intake can help prevent blood sugar spikes and greatly reduce the risk of diabetes complications.Therefore, it’s important to avoid the foods and drinks listed below.1.",energy,no,"

Word is getting out more and more about the harmful health problems associated with the “non-ionizing” RF (radio frequency) Radiation that WiFi routers emit. The concern has grown even more since the new 5G (60 GHz frequency) WiFi routers started hitting the store shelves. So is the typical WiFi signal safe?",harmful,neutral,"
no.

Is wifi harmful for health?,https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/the-fcc-just-approved-6-ghz-frequency-band-for-wi-fi-and-why-you-shouldnt-use-it/," The FCC has continued to allow more radiation and radiation-emitting devices into our environment with complete disregard for the public’s health and safety. Numerous studies have shown profound adverse health effects from Wi-Fi, both from the 2.45 GHz frequency used for Wi-Fi as well as effects from the pulsation and modulation of the Wi-Fi frequency used to carry the data. Harmful effects include “oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis, cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload”. Recently, a peer-reviewed meta-analysis was published in the industry’s IEEE journal stating: “For now, wireless technologies must be avoided as much as possible.” The authors continued, “People should be made aware that the EMR from using day to day cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices are harmful to human health”. In fact, the first study that showed that wireless radiation can break DNA was from 1996, and it was on the 2.45 GHz frequency. DNA damage was confirmed by dozens of studies, including the recent National Toxicology Program (NTP) $25 million study by the federal government, which showed CLEAR EVIDENCE that wireless causes cancer and DNA damage.",Numerous studies have shown profound adverse health effects,neutral,"

Is wifi harmful for health?,https://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2019/07/does-wifi-exposure-lead-to-cancer/," WiFi operates in similar frequencies as microwaves and cellphones, in the 2 to 5 GHz range.WiFi and radiationWireless networks stream invisible radio waves, a form of radiofrequency radiation (EMFs), through the air — similar to cellphones, computers, Bluetooth speakers, and other WiFi-powered devices.The concern around WiFi and routers causing cancer is due to the emission of these EMFs. These are invisible areas of energy that are produced by electricity and are often referred to as radiation. There are two types of EMFs: ionizing and non-ionizing. Ionizing radiation is “high-level radiation, which is has the potential for cellular and DNA damage.” Some forms of this type of EMF include ultraviolet (UV) rays and X-rays.Non-ionizing EMF is low-level radiation which is generally
viewed as harmless. Routers and electronic devices, such as cellphones,
computers and laptops, and Bluetooth devices (such as wireless headphones) emit
this type of radiation. The main concern regarding this type of EMF is although
it is low-frequency, electronic devices are all around us, and always on.When it comes to wireless routers, it is often assumed that
they are always sending and receiving information, but these devices transmit just
0.1% of the time.Is WiFi harmful to my health?",harmful to my health,neutral,"

Is wifi harmful for health?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/11/01/the-science-of-why-5g-is-almost-certainly-safe-for-humans/," Instead of ionizing individual electrons, this radiation can get absorbed and converted into thermal (heat) energy, and too much heat — just as it can cook plants, animals or fungi — can permanently damage living tissue. So it seems like a legitimate question: could 5G wireless technology, and the ambient radiation that it will create surrounding each and every one of us, possibly be damaging?

Is wifi harmful for health?,https://emfacademy.com/5-ghz-wifi-dangerous/," The short answer is, yes it can be, but not absolutely. I’m only going to cover the answer to this question briefly because I’ve already written close to 10 articles that answer this pretty well. Basically, WiFi uses radio waves to transmit data, and these radio waves are a form of Electromagnetic Radiation known as Radio Frequency, or RF, radiation. Any type of EMF radiation, including RF radiation, has been shown to have harmful effects on the body, especially in large doses over long periods of time. This is the reason that the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the World Health Organization labeled RF radiation (just like WiFi) a “Group 2B possible carcinogen based on the increased risk for glioma, a type of brain cancer associated with wireless phone use.”
It’s also the reason that cell-phone manufacturers have a limit on how much radiation can be emitted from their phones and absorbed into the human body.","yes it can be, but not absolutely",neutral,"

Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/expert-answers/apple-cider-vinegar-for-weight-loss/faq-20058394," Does it work? Answer From Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D. Apple cider vinegar isn't likely to be effective for weight loss. Proponents of apple cider vinegar claim that it has numerous health benefits and that drinking a small amount or taking a supplement before meals helps curb appetite and burn fat.

In all, the scientific evidence that vinegar consumption (whether of the apple cider variety or not) is a reliable, long-term means of losing excess weight is not compelling. (On the other hand, a number of studies suggest that vinegar might prevent spikes in blood sugar in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes by blocking starch absorption — perhaps that’s a topic for another day.) Even among proponents of apple cider vinegar for weight loss or other health benefits, it’s unclear when to drink apple cider vinegar (for example, whether there is particular time of day that might be best?) or how much apple cider vinegar per day is ideal. Is there a downside to the apple cider vinegar diet?",it’s unclear,neutral,"

Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss," Timing insulin with food intake becomes a challenge because it is difficult to predict how long it will take for blood sugar to rise after a meal (5).Since apple cider vinegar has been shown to extend the time food stays in your stomach, taking it with meals could worsen gastroparesis (6).SummaryApple cider vinegar helps promote fullness, in part due to delayed stomach emptying. This may naturally lead to lower calorie intake. However, it could worsen gastroparesis for some.It may help you lose weight and body fatResults from a small but widely cited 2009 study indicate that apple cider vinegar has impressive effects on weight and body fat (7).In this 12-week study, 144 Japanese adults with obesity consumed either 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vinegar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, or a placebo drink every day.They were told to restrict their alcohol intake but otherwise continue their usual diet and activity throughout the study.Participants who consumed 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day had — on average — the following benefits:Weight loss: 2.6 pounds (lb), or 1.2 kilograms (kg)Decrease in body fat percentage: 18%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.5 inches (in), or 1.4 centimeters (cm)Decrease in triglycerides: 26%This is what changed in participants who consumed 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar per day:Weight loss: 4.2 lb, or 1.7 kgDecrease in body fat percentage: 0.9%Decrease in waist circumference: 0.75 in, or 1.9 cmDecrease in triglycerides: 26%The placebo group actually gained 0.9 lb (0.4 kg), and their waist circumference slightly increased.In a 2018 clinical trial involving 39 participants on restricted calorie diets, those who consumed about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar (8).According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your body fat percentage, help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood triglycerides.These are two of only a few human studies that have investigated apple cider vinegar’s effects on weight loss. Although the results are encouraging, additional studies are needed.SummaryIn two studies, people with obesity who took 1–2 tbsp (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost weight and body fat.Other health benefitsIn addition to promoting weight and fat loss, apple cider vinegar has several other benefits:Lowers blood sugar and insulin: When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating (4).Improves insulin sensitivity: Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal may improve insulin sensitivity (9).Lowers fasting blood sugar: Studies have found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (10).Improves polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms: In a small 2013 study of women with PCOS who took vinegar for 90–110 days, 57% resumed ovulation, likely due to improved insulin sensitivity (11).Decreases cholesterol levels: A 2021 research review of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides (12).Lowers blood pressure: Animal studies suggest that vinegar may decrease blood pressure by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for constricting blood vessels. However, human studies haven’t shown significant decreases in blood pressure (13, 14).Kills harmful bacteria and viruses: Studies show that apple cider vinegar may be a powerful fighter against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria as well as resistant Escherichia coli (rE.",may help you lose weight,neutral,"

Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss," Evidence suggests that apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss when people combine it with a reduced calorie diet and regular exercise.A 2018 study on 39 people analyzed the impact of a low calorie diet and apple cider vinegar compared with a low calorie diet alone for 12 weeks. Researchers found that the participants who took apple cider vinegar:lost more weighthad a lower body mass index (BMI)improved their cholesterol and triglyceride levelsThese findings suggest apple cider vinegar may support other proven weight loss approaches.Another small study with 20 participants looked at the effects of taking 20 milliliters of apple cider vinegar per day in water. The researchers found a lower BMI in the 10 people who were overweight and lower fasting glucose in the other 10 subjects who had type 2 diabetes.Apple cider vinegar may also cause people to feel full for longer after eating. A crossover study in the Journal of Diabetes Research notes that acetic acid, one of the compounds in apple cider vinegar, helps to slow the rate at which food leaves the stomach in healthy people and those with type 1 diabetes.It is important to note that while some studies find apple cider vinegar aids weight loss, these studies are small, with a low number of participants and only modest results. Apple cider vinegar alone is unlikely to change a person’s BMI dramatically.Other health benefitsApple cider vinegar may have other health benefits for some people.

The answer might be yes, but it is not proven.The weight loss claims surrounding apple cider vinegar may stem from several small studies, mostly on animals. Nonetheless, these studies do show some possible benefits of apple cider vinegar and could open the door to further research.Body fat reductionShare on PinterestApple cider vinegar is a popular natural health treatment, and is thought to aid weight loss.Acetic acid, a compound found in apple cider vinegar, has been cited in some studies as the active ingredient that helps with weight loss.A study in Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry found that mice who were given acetic acid were less likely to gain body fat.The mice that were given the acetic acid had higher energy expenditure, oxygen intake, and burned more fat for energy than those given just water. The authors state that this suggests acetic acid could help suppress body fat buildup.A similar article in the same journal found that consuming vinegar did help reduce body fat, though the reduction was small. This study used 155 people who were considered obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 25–30.Over 12 weeks, three groups were given either 15 milliliters (ml) of vinegar, 30 ml of vinegar, or a placebo. Overall, those who consumed 15 or 30 ml of vinegar had a lower body weight, smaller waist, and less abdominal fat than those who did not have the vinegar.Feeling fullA study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at how glucose, insulin, and feelings of fullness were different in those who consumed acetic acid versus those who did not.Twelve people were given three different levels of vinegar with acetic acid after eating a portion of white bread.",it is not proven,neutral,"

Does drinking apple cider vinegar help lose weight?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-drinking-apple-cider-vinegar-in-the-morning-beneficial," A few human studies have shown that supplementing with apple cider vinegar may help suppress appetite and have a modest beneficial effect on weight loss. This is mainly attributed to acetic acid, a type of acid concentrated in apple cider vinegar that may have hunger-suppressing effects (1, 2). However, it’s important to note that there’s a lack of high quality human research in this area. While apple cider vinegar may slightly affect hunger levels, it’s unlikely that drinking apple cider vinegar will have any meaningful effect on your waistline — unless, of course, it’s combined with increased physical activity and healthy modifications to your diet.Additionally, drinking apple cider vinegar can cause adverse side effects, such as tooth erosion and nausea (3, 4). What’s more, there’s no evidence to say that throwing back a drink containing apple cider vinegar will rid your body of toxins. Your body has an entire system dedicated to detoxification, and it does not depend on supplements for optimal functioning.Lastly, there’s no scientific evidence to suggest that taking apple cider vinegar in the morning is more beneficial than doing so at any other time of the day.In closing, although it’s unlikely that taking a swig of apple cider vinegar in the morning will significantly affect weight loss, it’s generally harmless for most people.",may help suppress appetite and have a modest beneficial effect on weight loss,neutral,"

Apple cider vinegar has been shown to be most effective when paired with a diet full of starchy foods, as the acid slows down the digestion of starch. This could potentially assist those looking to lose weight, because slow digestion keeps you feeling fuller, longer. There’s also some evidence that drinking apple cider vinegar before a starchy meal keeps your blood sugars stable, making you less likely to crave sweet snacks. But does apple cider vinegar actually work to help you lose weight?

The researchers found a lower BMI in the 10 people who were overweight and lower fasting glucose in the other 10 subjects who had type 2 diabetes.Apple cider vinegar may also cause people to feel full for longer after eating. A crossover study in the Journal of Diabetes Research notes that acetic acid, one of the compounds in apple cider vinegar, helps to slow the rate at which food leaves the stomach in healthy people and those with type 1 diabetes.It is important to note that while some studies find apple cider vinegar aids weight loss, these studies are small, with a low number of participants and only modest results.

As such, most research on this application for ginger has been conducted in the first and second trimester (2). Ginger has been found to be more effective than a placebo at reducing morning sickness during pregnancy for many women (2). A study in 67 women who experienced morning sickness around 13 weeks of pregnancy found that taking 1,000 mg of encapsulated ginger daily reduced nausea and vomiting significantly more than a placebo (16).Research indicates that consuming up to 1 gram of ginger per day appears to be safe to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (2).",nauseaStudies show that ginger may prevent and treat,neutral,"

   The Science Behind Ginger and Nausea  

Ginger for nausea works directly on the stomach and is thought to increase the movement of the GI tract. A 2005 report from Obstetrics and Gynecology analyzed six clinical trials (with a total of 675 participants) and found that ginger was superior to a placebo and similar to vitamin B6 in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.﻿﻿



In addition, in a 2006 report from the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, investigators sized up five clinical trials (with a total of 363 patients) and concluded that taking ginger is more effective than placebo for post-surgery nausea and vomiting.﻿﻿



In 2012, another study reported in Integrated Cancer Therapy found that ginger was effective in reducing nausea caused by chemotherapy. Ginger was administered to women being treated for advanced breast cancer; the study found that "" A significantly lower prevalence of nausea was observed in the ginger group during 6 to 24 hours post chemotherapy. ""﻿﻿



On the other hand, according to a study published in 2014, ginger supplements are of little value in protecting against motion sickness.﻿﻿

Can treat many forms of nausea, especially morning sicknessGinger appears to be highly effective against nausea (3).It may help relieve nausea and vomiting for people undergoing certain types of surgery. Ginger may also help chemotherapy-related nausea, but larger human studies are needed (4, 5, 6, 7).However, it may be the most effective when it comes to pregnancy-related nausea, such as morning sickness.According to a review of 12 studies that included a total of 1,278 pregnant women, 1.1–1.5 grams of ginger can significantly reduce symptoms of nausea.However, this review concluded that ginger had no effect on vomiting episodes (8).Although ginger is considered safe, talk with your doctor before taking large amounts if you’re pregnant. It’s recommended that pregnant women who are close to labor or who’ve had miscarriages avoid ginger. Ginger is contraindicated with a history of vaginal bleeding and clotting disorders as well (9).

Does ginger help with nausea?,https://www.medicinenet.com/how_do_you_use_ginger_for_nausea/article.htm," In addition to having anti-inflammatory properties, ginger may improve digestion and promote the release of hormones that regulate blood pressure, which can calm the body and reduce nausea. The main bioactive compounds in ginger are gingerol and shogaols, which accelerate gastric emptying and stimulate gastric antral contractions through their activity on cholinergic M receptors and serotonergic 5-HT receptors. Shogaols are more concentrated in dried ginger, with 6-shogaol being its main source of antioxidants, whereas gingerols are more abundant in raw ginger.How much ginger should I take to reduce nausea? According to the FDA, consuming up to 4 grams of ginger per day is safe, although some studies recommend using less (200 to 2,000 mg per day).

Does ginger help with nausea?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-ginger-ale-help-with-nausea," This is key because ginger root is the one ingredient in it that might bring any relief to your upset stomach.In fact, ginger root has a long and studied history in the relief of nausea — whether it’s brought on by pregnancy, chemotherapy, indigestion, or other illness. Its anti-nausea ability is attributed to several compounds, like shogaols and gingerols (1, 2, 3, 4). While ginger root has long been linked to nausea relief, most ginger ale contains very little of it. Thus, ginger ale is unlikely to relieve nausea.Potential downsides to drinking ginger aleSome home remedies for nausea call for drinking ginger ale at room temperature, while others require drinking it flat. Flat, bubbly, warm, or cold, it’s usually just ginger-flavored sugar water — and while it might be delicious, it probably won’t help your nausea much.In fact, carbonation may actually make your nausea worse instead of bringing relief.",ginger ale is unlikely to relieve nausea,neutral,"

We often refer to the fresh ginger we eat — those knobby chunks with the tough skin — as ""ginger root,"" but that's not totally accurate.
