Can taking a vitamin D supplement prevent infection with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Answer From Daniel C. DeSimone, M.D. It is not clear if vitamin D supplements help prevent COVID-19 infection. You can help prevent infection from the COVID-19 virus by following these steps:

What’s the evidence that supplements are helpful for COVID-19? Though COVID-19 is a new illness, a few clinical trials have explored the possibility that supplements may be effective. And, unfortunately, most of the evidence is unconvincing. For example, a few observational studies link lower blood vitamin levels with a higher risk of testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 (see this study and this one).

SummaryThough research continues, evidence that vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is still limited. Having healthy vitamin D levels can enhance immune health and may be helpful in people with COVID-19.The bottom lineVitamin D plays many important roles in your body, including promoting the health of your immune system. Scientific research suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may protect against respiratory infections, especially among those who are deficient in the vitamin. Recent research indicates that sufficient vitamin D levels may help people with COVID-19 avoid adverse outcomes.

A number of recent studies have implied that vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium to strengthen bones, could play a role in COVID-19—from preventing infection to making the disease less severe.But some of the reports are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed, points out Kathleen Suozzi, MD, a Yale Medicine dermatologic surgeon. Dr. Suozzi says she worries that news coverage about the studies will cause people to sunbathe too much or take dangerous levels of vitamin D supplements. People get vitamin D from the sun, from eating foods that have it naturally or are fortified with it, and from supplements.It’s reasonable that if someone is really deficient in their vitamin D levels, we supplement them ... but it is premature to say this is a panacea.Thomas Carpenter, MD, Yale Medicine pediatric endocrinologistToo little vitamin D can lead to bone disorders in both adults and children; too much (from food or supplements) can be toxic and lead to heart and kidney problems, among others. Plus, trying to get too much of it from the sun puts people at risk for skin cancer.“Healthy people can get adequate vitamin D from their diets and from reasonable amounts of intermittent sun exposure, like going for a walk outdoors.",the evidence is slim,neutral

And while high levels of vitamin D might lower your risk for severe COVID-19 infection, there is no evidence that taking vitamin D supplements will provide protection against infection or improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.Vitamin D and Other ConditionsNot getting enough vitamin D may lead to or worsen these health problems:Heart diseaseHigh blood pressureDiabetesInfections and issues with your immune systemCertain types of cancer like colon, prostate, and breast cancersMultiple sclerosisPneumoniaBlood clotsAll these can raise your risk for severe COVID-19 if infected.Research shows that obesity and diabetes are linked to low levels of vitamin D. They’re also associated with higher death rates or severe COVID-19 symptoms.How to Get More Vitamin DMore sunlight and foods rich in vitamin D are the best ways. Try to get 15-20 minutes of sunlight, three days a week. And eat foods like:Oily fish (like salmon or sardines)Red meatEgg yolksFoods with vitamin D addedSupplements are also an option.

UPDATED January 2022: While this study and others have linked vitamin D levels to immune function, it is important to note that vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to be preventive of or a treatment for COVID-19. Vaccinations and public health measures such as masking and distancing are the best tools for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A new research study at the University of Chicago Medicine has found that when it comes to COVID-19, having vitamin D levels above those traditionally considered sufficient may lower the risk of infection, especially for Black people. The study, published in JAMA Open Network on March 19, retrospectively examined the relationship between vitamin D levels and likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. While levels of 30 ng/ml or more are usually considered sufficient, the authors found that Black individuals who had levels of 30 to 40 ng/ml had a 2.64 times higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than people with levels of 40 ng/ml or greater. Statistically significant associations of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 risk were not found in white people.",lower the risk of infection,neutral

That’s an inappropriate conclusion at this time because all we can say is that in countries where people had lower levels of vitamin D, there were more cases of COVID-19.

Moreover, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 cases, with a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D found in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure. Thus, there are promising reasons to promote research into the effects of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients. However, no studies to date have found that vitamin D affects post-COVID-19 symptoms or biomarkers.

Gussler said needs can vary from 1,00 IUs to 50,000 IUs.Should I take zinc?“Research is really supporting that zinc supplementation does reduce the severity, the frequency and the duration of the common cold,” Gussler said. “Obviously the research isn’t quite out there on COVID but we can extrapolate that it does have a lot of immune benefits.”If you’re sick, you may notice a boost of zinc can help you feel better. Both zinc and vitamin D are the main ingredients in many over-the-counter cold medicines.If you’re not sick, Gussler recommends only taking zinc through a multi-vitamin, typically not large amounts by itself.“Zinc and copper compete for the same receptor site in the body,"" Gussler said. “So, if you do a lot of zinc and not supplementing copper and making sure you’re getting enough copper, you can actually create a copper deficiency which can cause anemia for some people.”There are some zinc tablets that also contain copper, which you can ask your doctor if that’s a good option for you.The foods which contain Zinc also contain copper, which naturally helps to balance each other: Meat, shellfish, chickpeas, lentils, beans, nuts and seeds.Isn’t vitamin D deficiency common in the US?It sure is!Vitamin D deficiency is particularly common among Hispanic and black people, two groups who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, according to the Mayo Clinic.Vitamin D deficiency is also more common in people who are older, and those who are obese or have high blood pressure.",vitamin D and zinc do to fight COVID-19,neutral

Nevertheless, it should be part of a healthy lifestyle. FULL QUESTION
Could vitamin D help decrease the chance of covid 19? FULL ANSWER
As the coronavirus has spread around the globe, some scientists have proposed that vitamin D could help with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden, for example, published a March 23 column on Fox News’ website suggesting that vitamin D could reduce a person’s COVID-19 risk. “There are many crackpot claims about miracle cures floating around,” he wrote, “but the science supports the possibility – although not the proof – that Vitamin D may strengthen the immune system, particularly of people whose Vitamin D levels are low.”
The idea stems in part from experiments that have found that the vitamin, which is synthesized in the skin after sun exposure and is found in select foods, is used by the immune system.",there is no direct evidence that vitamin D can prevent COVID-19,no
Can vitamin D cure COVID-19?,http://foodmedcenter.org/vitamin-d-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know/," A 2017 meta-analysis revealed that patients who were Vitamin D deficient, often those over 70 years old, experienced the greatest benefit. Additional studies have demonstrated that Vitamin D plays numerous roles in the immune system response to infection, including impairing macrophages from maturing and producing antigens. Limitations of Study: The major limitation of this study is that Vitamin D levels are not currently available for COVID-19 patients. Researchers relied on previously established links between Vitamin D and the immune response to respiratory tract infections. Based on these links, the researchers in this study were able to establish a correlation between Vitamin D levels and the rate of COVID-19 deaths; however, further research is needed to account for other factors through direct measurement of Vitamin D levels among COVID-19 patients.

Some studies have found that vitamin-D can help prevent acute respiratory tract infections other than COVID-19. However, Adrian Martineau, a clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, says that analyses of these studies found that the research is inconsistent, leading to less informative results overall. “In some contexts you get protection, and other contexts you don’t get any effect at all,” says Martineau.

Though high dose IV vitamin C is currently being tested to see if it can improve lung function in people with COVID-19, no evidence suggests that high doses of oral vitamin C supplements can help with the disease.

A recent study suggests the popular immune health supplements are no match for novel coronavirus. “In this randomized control trial, which is the purest form of science out there, what we were able to show is that zinc, or vitamin C, or the combination of the two, did not reduce disease severity in outpatients that are affected by COVID-19,” said study author, Milind Desai, MD, of Cleveland Clinic. Cleveland Clinic researchers studied 214 people fighting mild-to-moderate coronavirus at home.

What supplements should I take for coronavirus (COVID-19)? Picture of vitamin C, a supplement that can help protect against COVID-19. COVID-19 causes a variety of telltale signs and symptoms, ranging from fever and dry cough to more extreme symptoms requiring immediate medical help such as difficulty breathing and confusion. To date, Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved antiviral drug available to treat COVID-19 symptoms. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir, and certain anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have received Emergency Use Authorizations from the FDA for treating COVID-19. If you have relatively mild COVID-19 symptoms and don’t have any other medical conditions that would put you at high risk for developing complications of COVID-19 (over the age of 65, diabetes, COPD, heart disease, kidney disease, HIV, asthma, undergoing cancer treatment), these vitamins and supplements might help strengthen your immune system to fight coronavirus.","vitamin C, a supplement that can help protect against COVID-19",neutral

TORONTO -- 
	Reports that hospitals are turning to high doses of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with severe cases of COVID-19 have reignited claims that the vitamin can prevent or cure cases of the novel coronavirus. Though vitamin C has long been touted as an immune-boosting vitamin, experts warn that its potential for treating coronavirus has not been proven. In fact, there is conflicting evidence to support the vitamin’s use as a treatment for the common cold or flu. Here is what you need to know about the claims involving vitamin C and COVID-19:

IS HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN C BEING USED TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS? Yes, some critically ill patients have been treated with high-dose intravenous vitamin C. However, there has yet to be any clear scientific evidence that this is an effective treatment for the virus. A study involving 140 coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the virus, is currently underway to determine the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in patients with severe acute respiratory infections.",Nicole Bogart,neutral

The appeal of safe, natural treatments is undeniable. It’s true for age-old conditions such as the common cold, and for new diseases, especially if they have no known cure. So it makes sense that there would be a lot of interest in supplements for COVID-19, whether as prevention or treatment. Indeed, zinc, melatonin, vitamin C, vitamin D, and other supplements have been commonly prescribed from the earliest days of the pandemic. But do they work?","vitamin D, zinc, and other supplements help prevent COVID-19",neutral
Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33916257/," In many of the publications, data were incomplete, and in most clinical trials the results are still pending. No studies regarding prevention of COVID-19 with vitamin C supplementation were found. Although some clinical observations reported improved medical condition of patients with COVID-19 treated with vitamin C, available data from controlled studies are scarce and inconclusive. Based on the theoretical background presented in this article, and some preliminary encouraging studies, the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be further investigated.

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-its-time-to-debunk-claims-that-vitamin-c-could-cure-it-132803," So let’s cut to the chase. Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus? Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection. I have written before that using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up. Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health.",unlikely,neutral

Conclusion
A variety of studies have shown that high-dose oral supplements of vitamin C and other essential nutrients such as vitamin D, magnesium, and zinc, can lower the risk of viral infection and COVID-19 and effectively reduce the intensity of infections. In a hospital ICU setting high-dose oral and IV vitamin C in combination with a well-established critical care protocol can treat COVID-19 to prevent serious pneumonia, need for mechanical ventilation, organ failure, septic shock, and death.

Louisiana National Guard runs virus testing sitesLouisiana National Guard runs virus testing sitesAPThe claim: High doses of Vitamin C effectively treat coronavirusAs researchers around the globe race to find effective treatments for the novel coronavirus, unfounded medical advice for how to cure COVID-19 has spread rapidly on social media. One such claim has gained traction online in recent days: that high doses of vitamin C could cure coronavirus infections.The claim has been shared and reposted on Facebook by users anxious for remedies and preventative measures against the rapidly spreading viral outbreak. But, there is no evidence that the studies alluded to on social media are real, nor is there any scientific backing for the fundamental claim regarding vitamin C.What the experts say: There is no evidence that Vitamin C helps treat COVID-19There is no scientific research supporting the claim that taking high doses of vitamin C could help prevent or cure COVID-19. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization state that the only way to minimize the chances of contracting the virus is to take preventative steps against infection.Social distancing from other people, frequent washing of hands and the cleaning of often-used surfaces are the only techniques on which there is expert consensus that they minimize the likelihood of contracting the novel coronavirus.“There is some reason to hypothesize that some vitamins and supplements could reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 because of benefits seen for other viral or respiratory disease,” Dr. Walter Willett, a professor at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told USA TODAY.Willett also advised that avoiding smoking, eating healthy foods, exercising and maintaining low stress levels are all important lifestyle practices in general and the only surefire ways of building up one’s immune system during a pandemic crisis.“All this said, it is critical to emphasize that the focus of preventing COVID-19 should be social distancing, washing hands, and not touching our faces,” Willett continued.Vitamin C has been shown to help reduce the severity of cold and flu illnesses in some trials, though this finding is widely debated by experts. The effect of taking the vitamin is also significantly less than many might expect.“The only impact that vitamins and supplements may have in any cold or flu is to lessen the severity,” Dr. Caroline Apovian, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, told USA TODAY. “In general, eating well and sleeping well will help your immune system; stress and anxiety and lack of sleep depresses the immune system,” she continued.Fact check: Will holding your breath for 10 seconds reveal if you have coronavirus?A research team at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, began a study on vitamin C treatments for COVID-19 on Feb. 14.",Coronavirus,neutral

COVID-19











SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a contagious virus affecting everyone. Researchers at Texas A&M University, in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College Medicine and Cedars Sinai Medical Center, are looking for health care workers, first responders, front line workers, seniors and those with preexisting health conditions to participate in a study evaluating the Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a booster of the immune response and to study if this vaccine reduces illness severity from coronavirus. The study will also examine if BGC will improve efficacy of recent vaccines.The goal of this trial is to learn if a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, a nearly 100-year-old commonly used tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, can help prevent COVID-19 infection and/or mitigate the severity of the illness compared to a placebo. Vaccine Trial Eligibility and Consent
To participate, volunteers must be:

At least 18 years old
Personnel working at a hospital, medical center or clinic, including medical, veterinary, dental and ophthalmology; first responders such as law enforcement, firefighters or paramedics; front line workers such as a teachers, wait staff, grocery store workers; or high risk individuals such as the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions

                  The BCG vaccine given to every British teenager between 1953 and 2005 to protect against tuberculosis could offer protection against Covid-19, a new study has found. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was first mass produced in 1924, and widespread vaccination for secondary school children was only halted in the UK when TB was effectively eradicated.Academics in the US compared the BCG jab's popularity in several countries with each nation's coronavirus outbreak — including both infections and deaths — and found a clear link between the vaccine and a lower mortality rate from Covid-19.When differences in social, economic, and demographics were taken into account, scientists found that where there was a 10 per cent greater prevalence of the BCG vaccine there was also a 10.4 per cent reduction in COVID-19 mortality. This suggests that in the UK, adults aged between 30 and 80 who were given the jab at school may have a greater level of protection.

Scientists around the world are racing to find ways out of the new coronavirus pandemic. Some are working to develop new drugs and vaccines, while others are looking to see whether therapies we already have may help against COVID-19.In the latter category, researchers have dusted off one intriguing compound in our collective medicine cabinet — a century-old vaccine to fight tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. A couple of early analyses, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that countries that require this vaccine, called Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), seemed to have been hit less severely, in terms of both number and severity, by the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.Could this vaccine be protecting people from COVID-19? The short answer is: We don't know.",We don't know,neutral
Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tuberculosis-vaccine-may-help-protect-against-covid-19," Unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity rarely targets specific pathogens that the body has encountered in the past.Researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA, wondered whether BCG might reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.“We were interested in studying the BCG vaccine because it has long been known to have a general protective effect against a range of bacterial and viral diseases other than TB, including neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections,” says co-senior author Dr. Moshe Arditi, director of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division at Cedars-Sinai.The team has reported their results online in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.COVID-19 symptoms and antibodiesBetween May 11 and June 18, 2020, 6,201 healthcare workers gave blood samples and answered questions about their medical history, including whether they had received BCG and vaccines against two other bacterial infections and influenza.In total, 1,836 said they had received the BCG vaccination, 4,275 said they had not received it, and 90 were unsure.Those with the vaccination were less likely to report experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 at any time in the past 6 months.Overall, 3.5% of the entire cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among those who reported receiving the BCG vaccine, 2.7% tested positive, while among those who said they hadn’t received it, 3.8% tested positive.“It appears that BCG-vaccinated individuals either may have been less sick and therefore produced fewer anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or they may have mounted a more efficient cellular immune response against the virus,” says Dr. Arditi.After adjusting for age and sex, BCG vaccination — but none of the other vaccinations — was still associated with a reduced likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.In their paper, the researchers write:“Taken together, these results indicate that a history of BCG vaccination confers a nonspecific protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2 and decreases the presence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms. This appears to be specific to BCG, as [other vaccinations] […] are not associated with similar protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2.”Self-reported vaccination historyOne of the study’s limitations was that it relied on participants’ recollection of which vaccines they had received, and whether they had experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms in the previous 6 months.In addition, the numbers in each group who developed symptoms or tested positive were relatively small, which limited the statistical power of the study and the reliability of its findings.However, it is interesting to note that those who reported receiving the BCG vaccination were older on average. They were also more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.These are all factors that increase a person’s chances of developing a severe COVID-19 infection.In August 2020, Medical News Today reported another observational study, which suggested countries with mandatory BCG vaccination had a degree of “herd immunity” against the disease.There are 22 clinical trials currently investigating BCG’s potential to prevent or treat COVID-19, which should provide more definitive evidence. Dr. Arditi and Cedars-Sinai are involved in one of the studies.No-one believes BCG will be more effective than specific vaccines for COVID-19, Dr. Arditi explains. But if the trials prove its worth, as a well-established vaccine, BCG could be quickly approved and rolled out for this application.",reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,neutral

The data collected on the booster’s ability to curb infection is early and limited; some clinical trials have shown that bivalent shots are no more equipped to prevent people from contracting COVID-19 than the original vaccines. Although some people have suggested the bivalent COVID-19 booster offers little protection against infection, DeSantis went further. He said people who received the bivalent booster shot were more susceptible to COVID-19 than those who hadn’t.

A widely used tuberculosis vaccine protected people with Type 1 diabetes from Covid-19, according to a Massachusetts General Hospital study published Monday that further illustrates the potential immune-enhancing powers of the shot, called BCG. The vaccine, a weakened version of the tuberculosis bacterium that infects cows, is given more than 100 million times a year around the globe to infants, but it isn’t part of the standard vaccination program in the U.S. Doctors have long suspected it has additional effects beyond tuberculosis prevention.

How a 100-year-old vaccine for tuberculosis could help fight the novel coronavirus




      The World Health Organization has cautioned against the use of the BCG vaccine for coronavirus until more is known, but teams around the world are studying the possibility it may help. Luis Escobar of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and colleagues used existing data to explore whether countries without a national BCG vaccination program have greater coronavirus mortality rates. In order to make a fair comparison, they accounted for factors such as population density, access to health care and response to Covid-19.",BCG can boost people’s immunity in general,neutral

There were initial concerns that this drug could worsen COVID-19 symptoms by increasing ACE2 levels. The theory stated that higher amounts of ACE2 could assist SARS-CoV-2 in attacking healthy cells around the body. However, there is still no evidence to support this. Doctors may recommend taking NSAIDs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever. Healthcare professionals also suggest taking ibuprofen for similar conditions, such as influenza.",There is no evidence,neutral
Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-to-know-about-ibuprofen-and-covid-19," One thing specific to COVID-19 is that some lab experiments are showing that ibuprofen may boost the amount of ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to infect cells and could make the virus spread faster.But that’s just theoretical.All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its stance on taking ibuprofen if you have COVID-19, but people are still scratching their heads over what they should take if or when they contract the virus.After previously announcing that people with the virus shouldn’t take ibuprofen to treat pain and fever, the WHO now says they don’t advise against it. The flip-flopping has a lot of people confused — especially those stocking up on medication in anticipation of getting the virus.Dr. Otto O. Yang, a professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Healthline there’s no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening of COVID-19, “although there is circulating misinformation to that effect.”Fever (medication) frenzyThe concern began after a study in The Lancet stated that ibuprofen boosts the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which may facilitate and worsen COVID-19. As a result, WHO originally warned most patients to stick with acetaminophen, which is also known as paracetamol or Tylenol.Patients likely have increased ACE2 expression if they’re treated with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), or thiazolidinediones, the report noted.",no evidence that ibuprofen causes worsening,neutral
Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/study-finds-ibuprofen-likely-doesnt-make-covid19-symptoms-worse," “More study is needed.”As such, patients should always talk to their doctors about taking NSAIDs, especially if they have heart, kidney, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal disease.“The fact that ibuprofen boosts ACE2 is derived from rat studies, and this effect may not necessarily crossover to humans,” noted Dr. Gurusaravanan Kutti-Sridharan, a clinical associate professor at Banner University Medical Center at the University of Arizona.The concerns that people taking ibuprofen could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 were legitimate. But we don’t know if ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels in humans, and if so, to what extent it may boost susceptibility to COVID-19, Kutti-Sridharan told Healthline.Anton Pottegård, PhD, an author, pharmacoepidemiologist, and clinical pharmacist at the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues, said he would like to see more research to replicate his findings.“However, considering the fairly hypothetical grounds on which the initial concern was raised, I would argue that we at the present time have limited reason to provide specific guidance for ibuprofen use specifically in relation to COVID-19,” Pottegård told Healthline.Is ibuprofen okay in people with COVID-19?Because this is a cohort study, its design could be vulnerable to biases including sampling, ascertainment, and observer bias. The gold standard is usually a randomized control trial, Poterucha said.“Much more study is needed to definitively understand adverse effects of NSAIDs and morbidity of COVID-19 ahead,” Poterucha said.There were more than 9,000 people to draw data from in this study, along with a matched cohort, so the research does show valuable information, said Dr. Rodney E. Rohde, an associate dean for research at Texas State University’s College of Health Professions focusing on public health microbiology.“However, I would continue to want to see more, larger studies looking across a strong sampling of demographics of populations before drawing any final conclusions,” he told Healthline.“There is not sufficient evidence to recommend those who take ibuprofen for other indications to stop or change ibuprofen to a different anti-inflammatory medication because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Kutti-Sridharan said.That said, it doesn’t mean that it’s entirely safe to take ibuprofen over the counter to manage fever or pain due to COVID-19.COVID-19 isn’t just a respiratory illness but a multi-system disease that can seriously affect the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart, along with many other organs.“Given its potential for renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular side effects, ibuprofen use, if indicated, should be restricted to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period, preferably under a doctor’s guidance to avoid serious adverse outcomes,” he added.Share this articleBy the Healthline Editorial Team on September 14, 2020 — Fact checked by Michael CrescioneRead this nextEverything You Should Know About the 2019 Coronavirus and COVID-19Get the facts about the 2019 coronavirus (and COVID-19).

PARIS (AFP) — Taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen does not increase the risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 or of dying from it, according to a new study, the largest so far on this class of medicines. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. But observational research published Saturday in the medical journal Lancet Rheumatology, based on 72,000 hospitalized patients, found that the drugs “do not increase the mortality or severity” of COVID-19. The authors recommended that doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs as they have in the past. “When the pandemic began over a year ago, we needed to be sure that these common medications would not lead to worse outcomes in people with COVID-19,” lead author Ewen Harrison, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said in a press release.",Ibuprofen does not worsen COVID-19 symptoms,neutral
Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-advises-patients-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids-covid-19," At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that “the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.”
For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are multiple over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. FDA suggests speaking to your health care professional if you are concerned about taking NSAIDs and rely on these medications to treat chronic diseases. FDA advises the public to read the full Drug Facts Label on OTC medications prior to use. OTC medications are safe and effective when you follow the directions on the label and/or as directed by your health care professional.",FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs,neutral

You must be cautious and seek medical advice when you take medications such as lithium, blood pressure or heart medications, and steroids while taking ibuprofen. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is presently no conclusive evidence that ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen COVID-19 or increase the likelihood of getting the infection. There have been several anecdotal reports and hypotheses that report ibuprofen increases the levels of an enzyme that is required for the entry of coronavirus.

Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/ibuprofen-and-covid-19-symptoms-heres-what-you-need-to-know-134064," Because novel coronavirus is a new type of virus, there is currently no evidence proving that taking ibuprofen will be harmful or make COVID-19 symptoms worse. Research in this area is developing fast, but with so much misinformation about COVID-19 and ibuprofen use, the cautious approach is to avoid ibuprofen with COVID-19 if at all possible – especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. Anyone who thinks they might have COVID-19 can consider using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen for managing their fever, unless they’re told otherwise by their doctor or pharmacist. In the meantime, the UK’s Committee of Human Medicines and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have been asked to review all the evidence to understand ibuprofen’s impact on COVID-19 symptoms. Naturally, people already prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug for a health condition should ask their doctor’s opinion and not just stop their medication. Paracetamol can also treat fever, as well as aches and pains.",make COVID-19 symptoms worse,neutral
Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ibuprofen-covid-19-novel-coronavirus-1.5501496," (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)The World Health Organization (WHO) has said there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition, a statement that was echoed Friday by Health Canada.Earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavus until WHO experts could investigate.Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, or NSAID.

Top 3 COVID-19 questions answered by an epidemiologistAn epidemiologist answers the biggest questions she's getting about coronavirus.USA TODAY, WochitThe claim: Using ibuprofen when you have coronavirus can make symptoms worseA French public health official tweeted a warning for coronavirus patients using ibuprofen over the weekend, helping spark alarm among many who fear the common pain and fever treatment could prove harmful as people around the world increasingly become sick during the COVID-19 pandemic.Anecdotal stories about people's experiences have received international attention, as guidance from health experts has been at times unclear. Publications have cited professors and medical doctors offering seemingly conflicting takes on the matter.One professor told the BBC that previous studies have linked ibuprofen to the worsening of respiratory infections, although there isn't strong data on COVID-19 specifically. Other experts essentially dismissed the concerns about ibuprofen in interviews with The New York Times, while noting that avoiding painkillers may help the immune system fight the virus.For those following the issue from the U.S., the topic can be even more difficult to understand because one of the alternatives to ibuprofen goes by a different name in Europe.What does the coronavirus do to your body? Everything to know about the infection processHospital beds: US hospitals will run out of beds if coronavirus cases spikeWhat's known in the U.S. as acetaminophen – sold under brand names including Tylenol – is called paracetamol in Europe.Also some confusing vocabulary: Ibuprofen is a part of a broader class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs.Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be used to treat fever and pain associated with COVID-19, according to the European Medicines Agency.What experts say: Little evidence, but some suggest cautionThere's consensus among experts about the lack of evidence: There's no widely accepted data about ibuprofen and COVID-19. However, many credible organizations have advised caution on the matter and often suggest acetaminophen as a possibly preferable treatment.A clear and updated guidance came Wednesday from a major health organization, when from England's National Health Service drew attention to the following recommendation:There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (COVID-19) worse.But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) on the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first.Another NHS document about treating COVID-19 in children admitted to the hospital describes paracetamol as the ""first line"" of fever treatment.Also on Wednesday, a World Health Organization spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY that while the organization was aware of concerns about the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of COVID-19, WHO has not yet issued any new guidance.",Using ibuprofen when you have coronavirus can make symptoms worseA,yes

Ibuprofen, which is also known by the brand names Advil and Motrin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). These types of medications can help lower your fever and minimize muscle aches from COVID-19, while also reducing some inflammation in your body. Ibuprofen doesn’t treat the virus itself, but it can make you feel a lot better. There was some concern early on in the coronavirus outbreak that ibuprofen and drugs like it might worsen outcomes for coronavirus patients, but so far we haven’t seen anything to support that.",worsen outcomes for coronavirus patients,neutral
Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/ibuprofen-covid-19-severity-5077696," Ibuprofen and ACE2 Expression: Another COVID-19 Risk? A study published in The Lancet in April added to initial concerns of taking ibuprofen with COVID-19. Researchers suggested that people taking certain medications for conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 if they additionally took ibuprofen.﻿﻿ The reason? These medications in question—ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), or thiazolidinediones—increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the body, and ibuprofen can make that expression even stronger. SARS-CoV-2 enters the body by binding to that enzyme receptor.﻿﻿

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh say the sea salt may work by boosting cells’ antiviral defence that kicks in when they are affected by a cold. The team has re-examined the data and discovered the same benefits were also experienced by those participants who were infected with one of the four common coronaviruses known to cause colds. Researchers now aim to investigate whether the same solution will benefit those who are experiencing symptoms of the new strain of coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. Recent symptoms

      This report provides a perspective on the relevance of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation to the COVID-19 crisis. While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions. We attempt to derive novel insights into their usefulness, both from theoretical and practical standpoints.",there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role,neutral

Other European researchers, reporting in Rhinology Online, speculate that copper-enhanced nasal saline irrigations confer protection against COVID-19. Based upon a study that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in which copper eliminated all viable SARS-CoV-2 virus on its surface within four hours, the authors suggest that copper-infused sale solution may “decrease the potential risk of viral infection by both a mechanical and biological effect.” No studies assessing the effects of copper on COVID-19 have been listed yet on ClinicalTrials.gov.

The study hopes to see if it will “reduce the duration of symptoms and transmission to others in the same household.”
The team’s previous study, published last year, suggested that using salt water reduced common colds by an average of two-and-a-half days. It suggests that certain human cells were able to use chloride ions — a component of sea salt — to create hypochlorous acid, which is the active ingredient in bleach and has antiviral properties.

The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 brought a raft of dubious and false medical advice about the prevention and treatment of the illness to the internet, among which was one widely circulated graphic advocating that persons exposed to the virus try gargling various substance to 'eliminate' the virus and prevent it from reaching the lungs via the throat:

Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/gargling-water-with-salt-wont-eliminate-coronavirus/," There is currently “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” according to the World Health Organization. Full Story 
It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.",there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,neutral

However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help.A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore.They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a ""compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation.

Detailed Description:
The aim of this study is to determine if prolonged rinsing (30 minutes) of mouth without gargling using a Hypertonic Saturated Sodium Chloride solution would reduce/eliminate the Upper Respiratory viral load in Covid-19 infected patients compared to a placebo (Plain Water Rinse). Patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 using Nucleic Acid Test via Nose or Throat Swabs within 7 days prior to the start of the trial will be instructed to use either of the two treatment arms (Active or Placebo) for 30 minutes twice daily for two days and retested for Covid 7 days after the last treatment
A randomized blinded controlled study, whereas a number of patients (at least 20) with clinically-confirmed Covid-19 infection within 7 days prior to the start of the study, are equally divided into 2 groups, Active and Control groups, using Active and Control Mouth rinses respectively. The Active Rinse is a 25 ml of Hypertonic Saturated Saline solution made by mixing 10 grams of Sodium Chloride (Table Salt) in 25 ml of Tap water with some salt crystals deposited. The Control Rinse is a 25 ml of Plain Tap Water. Each Patient of both groups will be asked to keep the solution still in his/her mouth, close to the back of the mouth, for 30 minutes without gargling and without swallowing.

Thank you – Team WebQoof)A long text message that has gone viral on the internet claims that German scientists have found that we can stop the novel coronavirus from reaching our lungs by ""gargling with a semi-hot solution of salt and water"" several times a day. The claim goes on to say that by following this practice, an alkaline environment would be created in the mouths, which would prevent the COVID-19 virus from multiplying. However, we found that the claims made in the viral post were false. We didn't find any such recommendations made by German scientists. Additionally, claims like gargling with hot water kills COVID-19 and that the virus is sensitive to changing pH had gone viral at the beginning of the pandemic and have resurfaced amid rising cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant.ADVERTISEMENTCLAIMThe viral claim starts by saying, ""German scientists announced, after a series of studies, that the Coronavirus not only reproduces in the lungs like the SARS virus in 2002, but also spreads widely in the throat during the first week of infection.",we can stop the novel coronavirus from reaching our lungs,neutral

Researchers at Edinburgh University trialled saltwater gargling and 'nasal irrigation' in a trial on people with upper respiratory tract infections, otherwise known as coughs and colds, and found it reduced their symptoms and the length of their illness.Their study, published in the journal Scientific Reports last year, found 93 per cent of people said gargling reduced their symptoms, their illnesses lasted two days less, on average, and they were 35 per cent less likely to pass it on to a family member.Scientists hope the cheap, simple therapy could have similar benefits for people with the coronavirus, reducing the severity of their cough and preventing the illness from worsening.Explaining how the salt could achieve this effect, the study said direct contact with salt may have a toxic effect on the viruses themselves and damage or kill them.It may also stimulate 'innate immune mechanisms' inside cells in the airways, they suggested, effectively boosting the body's own ability to fight off infection.Salt may also be soaked up and used by the body's cells to create a chemical called hypochlorous acid which is found in bleach and known to kill viruses, the researchers said.

 'It only requires salt, water and some understanding of [gargling] procedure, so should, if found to be effective, be easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely. 'The study is open only to adults living in Scotland who have symptoms of Covid-19 or have recently received a positive test for the virus.It is expected to operate similarly to the previous one in which some participants will gargle salt water while others down, with all of them following the same lockdown rules.In the cough and cold study people kept diaries of their symptoms for two weeks and reported back to the scientists, who compared which group fared best.The NHS currently only has treatments for coronavirus patients who are seriously ill, and those still do not work for everyone. One is the steroid dexamethasone, which a study found could cut death rates in intensive care patients by up to a third.And the second is an Ebola drug called remdesivir, which has shown promising results in shortening recovery times. Both are approved for NHS use specifically for Covid-19 patients - for much of the UK's outbreak doctors were limited to experimenting with whatever antiviral drugs and antibiotics they could find.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the trial success of dexamethasone - which was announced on June 16 - as the 'biggest breakthrough yet' in treating coronavirus.He said at a press conference: 'I'm absolutely delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK... 'I think there is genuine cause to celebrate a remarkable British scientific achievement [and] the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world.",easy – and inexpensive – to implement widely,neutral

The role of ginger plants against COVID-19






Dear Editor
Thank you to the authors for this thought-provoking editorial [1]. Zimmermann et al (2022) reveal long COVID-19 in children and adolescents, symptoms involving almost every organ system after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concern has focused more on the potential long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, I believe that functional foods, especially Gingerae, play a role in fighting COVID-19. Western medicine solves the issue of human organs, and traditional Chinese medicine solves the issue of human body system; however, functional food is to address the problem of human cells[2]. The 12 key functional components of barley grains and its grass not only play an important role in the prevention and treatment of more than 20 chronic human diseases but also interact with 30 other nutritional functional components to provide the possibility to solve hundreds of human diseases caused by cell undernutrition and their detoxification disorders [2].",functional foods,neutral

One major thing is that most viral infections attack the immune system, of which these plants have the properties that could boost the immune system. I think it is not really far from the truth to say that you can use extracts of ginger, garlic and many other medicinal plants to take care of the associated symptoms of viral infections, including COVID-19.

Health experts warn that we don’t have enough data to support the use of herbal remedies for COVID-19.Though we may eventually find that certain herbs may be beneficial for the coronavirus, the science is scarce and now is not the time to start experimenting with herbal remedies on your own if you contract COVID-19.“Everything has to be taken with an understanding that we don’t have any data with the coronavirus,” Dr. Felicia Gersh, the founder and director of the Integrative Medical Group of Irvine in Irvine, California, told Healthline. “Who knows what the future may bring.”Herbs may help with other virusesHerbal remedies have long been used to treat infections and viruses, such as the common cold, influenza, fever, and even herpes.

Photograph: Action Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe country’s public health insurance companies, which are part-financed by German taxpayers, have duly picked up the tab via flat-rate payments for hospital treatment of coronavirus patients.However, public acceptance of the movement and its philosophies is facing renewed scrutiny after a year in which Germans have seen followers of the Steiner philosophy march alongside anti-vaxxers and the far right in protest at the government’s measures against coronavirus.Best known outside Germany for the left-leaning schools focused on self-directed play with wooden toys, Steinerism started out as a multi-disciplinary spiritualist philosophy in the late 19th century.Born in 1861 as a citizen of the Austrian empire, Steiner claimed to have access to higher spiritual planes that gave him insights into reincarnation, links between cosmic bodies and plant growth, and evolutionary history, including the years of Jesus’s life not covered by the Bible and the sunken continent of Atlantis.By the time of his death in 1925, Steiner had applied his philosophy to a wide array of subjects, including education, architecture, agriculture, dance and medicine.In the 21st century, anthroposophy remains a minority movement, albeit one that enjoys a high level of social acceptance and institutional support in German-speaking countries. In Germany, there are more than 200 schools, more than 500 nurseries and 263 institutions for people with mental disabilities that follow Steiner’s philosophy. The country’s highest grossing drugstore chain, dm-drogerie markt, and second-largest chain of organic supermarkets, Alnatura, are both run by self-professed anthroposophists, and cosmetic products made by Steiner-devoted brands like Weleda and Dr Hauschka are not only for sale in German pharmacies but are also enjoying a global boom.While the number of employees working at these institutions and businesses who take Steiner’s philosophy at face value is likely to be low and dwindling, the movement has carved out a steady presence in German public life.“In some ways anthroposophy is a German success story”, said Helmut Zander, a historian of religion who has written books critical of the Steiner movement. “It hits a nerve that our society has for a long time ignored. Organic farming has gone mainstream over the last decade – Steinerists have done it since the 1960s.”Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) claimed insights into everything from reincarnation to Atlantis.",ginger-soaked chest compresses,neutral

Tavel recommends taking Cold-Eeze lozenges, an OTC medication containing zinc gluconate, several times a day for upper respiratory symptoms.“Since there is little harm in such a strategy, it may be worth a try,” he said.Vitamin C“It supports the activity of our immune cells, especially when they work more than they should during outbreaks,” said Asli Elif Tanugur Samanci, a food scientist and chief executive officer of Bee & You. “I would recommend 1 to 3 grams a day, on top of a healthy diet that’s rich in fresh vegetables and fruit.”Herbal remedies like turmeric and ginger“They both have incredible anti-inflammatory properties and also very high in antioxidants,” said Samanci.“Further, ginger is full of chemicals that fight off cold and relieves stomach-related problems. Turmeric also has hundreds of active chemicals and is a great pain reliever,” Samanci said. “You can either add them fresh or juice them to get the full spectrum of benefits.”A thermometerIf you suspect you have a mild case of COVID-19, you’ll need a thermometer to check your temperature twice a day, since being fever-free is one of the requirements for ending self-quarantine.If your symptoms get worse, call a healthcare professional.Household cleaning and sanitizing productsGloves, soap, hand sanitizer, surface-cleaning products, mops, and sponges will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your household.Extra sheets, towels, and pajamas“When you are sick, you can contaminate all the surfaces you come into contact with,” said Peters.",using zinc lozenges,no

Honey, ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment for Covid-19
12 May 2021









What was claimed
Honey, pepper and ginger can ‘100%’ eliminate the effect of Covid-19 and has been approved by the WHO. Our verdict
This treatment for Covid-19 has not been approved by the WHO. The WHO says that although some spices may be beneficial for health, there is no evidence that this particular mix can protect from Covid-19 infection. Readers have asked us to fact check a widely shared WhatsApp message which claims that a student at the University of Pondicherry in India has found a home remedy for Covid-19. The message claims that the remedy, which includes pepper powder, honey and ginger juice can “eliminate the effect of corona up to 100%” and has been “approved by the WHO [World Health Organisation]”. In fact, rather than endorsing this remedy, the WHO has said the exact opposite.",ginger and pepper isn’t approved treatment,neutral

And, such radiation can’t cause COVID-19. COVID-19 is a viral disease that comes from the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of similar myths in the future, experts need to consistently and clearly correct common misconceptions. And better transparency from both government bodies and researchers could prevent misinformation from ever taking root. “We [researchers] need to humanize the conversations around misinformation and continue to share true information so that misinformation becomes less prevalent in the media,” said Nsoesie.

Did 5G cause or help spread the coronavirus? The answer to 5G involvement with the coronavirus is simple and straightforward, according to every scientist and doctor that Fortune spoke with. There simply is no connection between 5G and the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. There is no mechanism by which a wireless technology could cause a virus to mutate into a killer epidemic and no way that wireless airwaves can transmit viruses. It is, as Stephen Powis, medical director for the British National Health Service, says, “complete and utter rubbish.”
Some claimed that 5G wireless may have made people more susceptible to the coronavirus by weakening their immune systems.

But there’s one thing you can permanently take off your concern list: 5G has no causal connection to COVID-19, contrary to several recent misguided online rumors. In fact, according to a seven-year-long scientific study published just this month, 5G has no detrimental health effects in general.But it’s worth examining why 5G can’t possibly be related to the coronavirus from a scientific and factual perspective and why it isn’t a health concern in general. Plus, along the way, you might learn a little bit more about how 5G and cellphones work.As with many other conspiracy theories, the supposed 5G coronavirus connection came from uninformed people on the internet trying to link things that are not at all connected. Unfortunately, the power of social media recently amplified some of these misguided comments to a level that swayed even otherwise rational people to start wondering whether the comments might be true.They’re not, and I’ll explain why. But first, a bit more background.Coronavirus and 5G: The beginningThe COVID-19 coronavirus is widely reported to have originated at a market in the city of Wuhan in China, likely around December of last year.",5G didn't,no

PODGORICA, 11 JULY 2021 – Almost one-third of the citizens of Montenegro (31%) believe that 5G technology causes or spreads coronavirus and that this is being kept secret so that the companies dealing with this technology can continue to make a significant profit.

UNICEF's Young Reporters analysed this conspiracy theory in Montenegro to check if there was any truth in it.

There have been many potentially dangerous theories related to COVID-19, ranging from the new coronavirus being human-made to the idea that injecting bleach or other disinfectants could protect against infection.With the coincidental rollout of 5G technology, rumors have also linked the new technology to the new coronavirus.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Factors behind the spread of misinformationThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread lockdowns across the world in 2020.",5G having links to COVID-19,neutral

Hakusui noted that 60GHz was the true radiofrequency that would allow for reliable transmission of data, due to its “98 percent oxygen absorption” rate. This allows the invisible signals to travel from point A and B, and back again on the same path. Super-efficient and a technological milestone. And:

The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty.

Can herbal tea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/green-tea-and-covid," Originating from China, green tea is lauded for many health benefits due to its potential antioxidant, antiviral and immune-boosting properties (1, 2).It’s recently been investigated for a possible role in managing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes illness from COVID-19. You may have heard that drinking green tea prevents or cures the disease.In this article, we explain whether green tea affects COVID-19 and offer some immune-boosting tips.Share on PinterestDylan Leeder/Stocksy UnitedDoes green tea prevent or cure COVID-19?Green tea is rich in health-promoting polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has anti-viral effects against single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like Zika, hepatitis C, influenza (flu), dengue, and others (1, 3, 4, 5).Like these, the SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA virus. Thus, green tea extracts continue to be investigated for their potential role in treating the virus and managing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2).Test-tube research shows that green tea extracts may combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus by damaging the spike protein, preventing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall volume of the virus (3, 4, 5, 6).Treatment of the test tube cells with EGCG was most effective during early stages of infection (3).However, it’s important to understand that drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. Most studies showing an effect used single green tea extracts like EGCG in concentrated amounts much higher than what’s found in the natural tea.Furthermore, EGCG is poorly absorbed when consumed orally from teas (4).Nonetheless, green tea extracts may have potential to be used for natural treatment of COVID-19 after further human research and testing.Remember, the best way to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated, maintaining physical distancing, and washing your hands often.

 |  Daily News CorrespondentsAn estimated 159 million Americans regularly drink tea, and according to the Tea Association, in 2020 we downed more than 3.8 billion gallons of it – primarily iced and black. While that may sound like a lot, when averaged over our population, we lag behind many countries including Turkey, the United Kingdom and China.Part of the reason some cultures around the globe have consumed tea for nearly five millennia has been to take advantage of its health benefits. Fast forward to 2021 and tea’s ability to support our immune system amid the COVID-19 pandemic is as important as ever.Traditional teas like black, green and oolong are full of polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), naturally occurring organic compounds that have a potent antioxidant effect on our bodies and therefore may reduce chances of heart disease and cancer. EGCG and the amino acid L-theanine both pack an immune-boosting punch. To get the most antioxidant bang for your buck, avoid adding milk or cream because their proteins may inhibit some polyphenols.Depending on variety, the amount of time and the temperature in which tea leaves are steeped will impact antioxidant levels. White tea should be steeped longer in hot water while black tea is best steeped for a short amount of time in very hot water.",tea’s ability to support our immune system,neutral

The Federal Trade Commission, jointly with the Department of Justice and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have sued a New York-based marketer of herbal tea, seeking to permanently block deceptive ads that claim its Earth Tea is clinically proven to treat, cure, and prevent COVID-19. The FTC also is seeking to impose civil penalties on the defendants behind Earth Tea under the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act. The complaint announced today names as defendants Brooklyn-based B4B Earth Tea LLC, B4B Corp., and its owner, Andrew Martin (“Busta”) Sinclair. “Without any scientific evidence, the defendants claimed that drinking their herbal tea is more effective in preventing COVID-19 than approved vaccines, and cures anyone who has gotten ill within 24 hours,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “In bringing this matter with our partners at the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration, the Commission continues its commitment to using every tool available to stop and deter those who would treat the pandemic as opportunity to peddle bogus treatments.”
“The Department of Justice will not tolerate individuals or companies seeking to profit from the COVID-19 public health emergency by unlawfully advertising unproven products,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The Department is committed to protecting consumers and enforcing the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act and the FDCA against those who unlawfully market unproven COVID-19 treatments.”

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no

      At the beginning of the pandemic, there was great enthusiasm for convalescent plasma as Covid-19 survivors  sought to save lives, donating antibodies against the virus to people who were sometimes at death’s door. In August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for the treatment, but some questioned whether it was politically motivated and whether the data really showed that it worked. An electronic screen in New York City in August shows an advertisement calling for plasma donation from patients recovered from Covid-19. Wang Ying/Xinhua/Getty

Is convalescent plasma a treatment for COVID-19? Right now, it is not known if convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, there’s some evidence that suggests it can help some patients with COVID-19. While convalescent plasma transfusions are generally safe and well-tolerated by many people, further investigation is still needed to determine if it can shorten the duration of illness, reduce the severity of symptoms or prevent death associated with COVID-19.

In theory, it could speed recovery by transferring antibodies that could block the virus. The approach is called passive immunization. Studies had suggested that convalescent plasma treatment might lower the risk of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients if administered early in the disease—before mechanical assistance was needed to help them breathe. Based on such findings, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, in 2020 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral
Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/convalescent-plasma-therapy-provides-limited-success-in-treating-covid-19/," But since the therapy’s emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2020, its supposed benefits have been met with scrutiny by some researchers.To investigate the success of convalescent plasma therapy in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19, a team of researchers from seven institutions came together, including Alessandro Santin, MD, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, and Mahalia Desruisseaux, MD, associate professor of internal medicine (infectious disease), who led the portion of the clinical trial done at Yale School of Medicine. While the therapy, the team found, provided no improvement in the overall survival of COVID-19 patients says Santin, it shouldn’t be ruled out in early pandemic cases where no other treatment options are available. The team reported their results in JAMA Internal Medicine on December 13.“This is one of the largest double-blind prospective randomized studies ever done on COVID-19 for patients with severe disease,” says Santin.Convalescent plasma therapy involves health professionals collecting antibodies that fight diseases such as COVID-19 through extracting blood plasma from donors who have survived the disease. By providing patients with these borrowed antibodies that are specific against the variant spreading in the population at a specific time point, the goal of the therapy is to give sufferers of the disease what scientists refer to as “passive immunity.” The use of convalescent plasma therapy dates back to the 1918 Spanish flu and has been used over the last century to fight outbreaks including the smaller SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003. ""The bottom line is that the evidence showed during both the Spanish flu 100 years ago and SARS-COV-1 that fewer people were dying after being treated with convalescent plasma,” says Santin.The clinical trial, known as CONTAIN COVID-19, began in April 2020, during the early days of the pandemic in the United States. The study began by enrolling hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients in New York City, but would soon expand to include patients in 21 hospitals affiliated with seven centers across the country, including Yale School of Medicine.",reducing the severity and mortality,neutral

Scientific Evidence on Convalescent Plasma
Based on an evaluation of the EUA criteria and the totality of the available scientific evidence, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research determined that the statutory criteria for issuing an EUA criteria were met. The FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in lessening the severity or shortening the length of COVID-19 illness in some hospitalized patients.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/using-convalescent-blood-to-treat-covid-19-is-it-possible," This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently.Recently, researchers and healthcare professionals have been looking into the possibility of using this method to treat people with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In the United States, a group of researchers and doctors from 57 institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are investigating and applying convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.This is a concerted initiative — called the “National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project” — born after the publication of a viewpoint paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation in March, 2020.The paper argued for the potential merits of passive antibody therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. It was authored by immunologists Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.To understand more about convalescent plasma therapy, its merits, its risks, and its current use in COVID-19 treatments, Medical News Today recently spoke to Dr. Casadevall.Here is what he told us, alongside more information on the current state of convalescent plasma therapy.A therapy ‘used for over 100 years’So, where did the idea of using convalescent plasma, or passive antibody therapy, come from?This notion was first introduced in the late 19th century when physiologist Emil von Behring and bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburou discovered that they could use antibodies present in serum — another blood component — to fight the bacterial infection diptheria.Since then, doctors have used passive antibody therapy, on and off, at least since the 1930s to treat or prevent both bacterial and viral infections, including forms of pneumonia, meningitis, and measles.When we asked him how the idea of using convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 came about, Dr. Casadevall told us: “I have worked on antibodies my entire life professional life […], and I knew that convalescent plasma — or sera […] — was being used for over 100 years.”“In fact, the first Nobel Prize was given [to Behring] for the use of serum to treat diphtheria, so I knew the history.” This long history of successfully using this method against different infectious diseases suggested that it might also be effective against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.“I knew that in epidemics when you don’t have a lot of things, […] the blood of those who recover can have antibodies that can be used [as treatment],” Dr. Casadevall explained.“So it’s an old idea, it’s been around for a long time, and I think that my contribution was, in fact, to alert my friends, authorities, that this [therapy] could be used in this epidemic.”Recent research has already shown that people who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 have developed antibodies that can react to the coronavirus.“There [are] now multiple studies that have shown that when people recover from the virus, they have in their blood neutralizing antibodies that are able to kill the virus,” Dr. Casadevall also told MNT.Although “[p]eople differ greatly in the amount of antibodies that they make — some make large amounts, some make small amounts — […] the good news is that most have [them],” he added.Given the willingness of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate blood, the method seems feasible right now. In fact, some doctors are already using convalescent plasma therapy in some cases.Settling the matter of safetyIn the U.S., the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project have already been trialing this method as widely as possible.Dr. Casadevall told MNT that “in the United States, we have close to 12,000” people who have received the convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19.Based on the data obtained from a little less than half of this cohort, Dr. Casadevall and his colleagues have concluded that this approach is safe for the patients receiving treatment — the first step necessary before ascertaining the method’s effectiveness.The team has reported these findings in a preprint that they have made available online.“[On May 14], we put out a paper on the first 5,000 [patients] showing that [this therapy] was relatively safe. That’s the first step,” Dr. Casadevall explained.“You want to show safety. And then the question of efficacy will be coming in the next few weeks.",This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently,neutral

   What Other Studies Showed  

Research on convalescent plasma use in COVID patients has produced mixed results. In August, the Clinical Trial of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Outpatients found that convalescent plasma was not effective against COVID-19 when it was given to patients within the first week after their symptoms appeared. NIH Says No Benefit of Convalescent Plasma as COVID-19 Treatment



In early December, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against using convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19, except in clinical trials. Likewise, the use of convalescent plasma is not allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for outpatient use except, again, in clinical trials.

Researchers wanted to know whether administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial in persons who were recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, but who were not severely ill and could be treated as outpatients. The objective was to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 illness. The C3PO trial, launched in August 2020, was designed to answer that question. The randomized, controlled clinical trial involved adult outpatients who presented to emergency departments with mild COVID-19 symptoms during their first week post-infection. The trial was conducted by the SIREN clinical trials network, and enrolled more than 500 participants from 48 emergency departments across the United States.",administering COVID-19 convalescent plasma might also be beneficial,neutral

This new Kaiser Permanente study provides evidence that these bacterial-viral interactions may play out in ways that shape the course of COVID-19. While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing COVID-19, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine. In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection. This study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1 to July 22, 2020.

In this review, the authors have presented positive reports of pneumococcal immunization in COVID-19 individuals with underlying medical problems. Despite the fact that the WHO has stated that bacterial vaccination does not protect against COVID-19 pneumonia, the authors have demonstrated that there is a correlation between pneumococcal disease and COVID-19 in terms of preventing increased morbidity and mortality from secondary infections and superinfections. The authors discussed why pneumococcal vaccination is important in the current pandemic context to improve the global health system in the fight against COVID-19.

There are two kinds of pneumococcal vaccines available in the United States:

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20)
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23)

How pneumococcal vaccination protects against COVID-19
Protection against serious COVID-19 disease by pneumococcal and Hib vaccines makes sense for several reasons. First, recent studies reveal that the majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in some studies nearly all, are infected with streptococci, which causes pneumococcal pneumonias, Hib or other pneumonia-causing bacteria. Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Protection against serious COVID-19 disease,neutral

The immune system is a marvel of evolution, and it is far from being fully understood. The newest immunological head-scratcher: Researchers have found that being vaccinated recently for something other than coronavirus — say, a hepatitis or measles vaccine — makes one more resistant to COVID-19. In an article published last month by the journal Scientific Reports, scientists found that a number of different vaccines were associated with lower rates of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. These included the vaccines for Geriatric Flu, Haemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), hepatitis A/hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella, pneumococcal conjugate, polio and Varicella. In particular, the patients studied who had been vaccinated against polio and HIB generally had the lowest relative risk for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 across all time horizons.",makes one more resistant to COVID-19,neutral

Pfizer said it will seek to present and publish detailed outcomes from this clinical trial at a future date. At this time no co-administration data are included in the PREVNAR 20 or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine prescribing information.About Prevnar 20Prevnar 20 is Pfizer’s next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharide conjugates for the 13 serotypes already included in Prevnar 13® (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) and seven additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F and 33F) that cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and have been associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis. Prevnar 20 helps protect against more strains of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia than any other conjugate vaccine available.Influenza vaccine with COVID-19 booster shot shows positive results…Related topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, Research & Development (R&D), VaccinesRelated organisationsPfizerRelated drugsCOMIRNATY®, Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20Related peopleDr Kathrin JansenRelated diseases & conditionsCoronavirus, Covid-19, meningitis, Pneumococcal disease              By Hannah Balfour (European Pharmaceutical Review)14 January 2022No comments yetShares11             Share via  Pinterest Reddit Buffer Xing WhatsApp FlipboardRelated topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, Research & Development (R&D), VaccinesRelated organisationsPfizerRelated drugsCOMIRNATY®, Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20Related peopleDr Kathrin JansenRelated diseases & conditionsCoronavirus, Covid-19, meningitis, Pneumococcal disease                  Most popular...Major study on DMT shows promise for depressionFirst CAR T-cell therapy recommended on NHSEMA validates first regulatory submission for CRISPR-based medicinePersonalised cancer immunotherapy granted fast track designationOnivyde® improves survival in Phase III pancreatic cancer trial

                  Injection with the female sex hormone progesterone could improve outcomes for men hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infections, a study has concluded.The finding by researchers from California follows multiple reports that men are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus than women.Progesterone has certain anti-inflammatory properties and thus, the team said, may be able to dampen the often fatal immune responses called 'cytokine storms'. Injection with the female hormone progesterone could improve outcomes for men hospitalised with severe COVID-19 infections, a study has concluded (stock image)The research was undertaken by pulmonologist Sara Ghandehari of the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles and her colleagues. 'As an ICU doctor, I was struck by the gender disparity among COVID-19 patients who were very sick, remained in the hospital and needed ventilators,' she said. Progesterone is produced in both men and women's bodies, although the latter produce considerably more of the hormone during their reproductive years. Experts have also noted that premenopausal women tend to experience less severe cases of COVID-19 than their postmenopausal counterparts.Premenopausal women tend to have higher progesterone levels while such tends to decrease to lower levels post-menopause.",Injecting MEN with the female hormone progesterone,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-expert-review-finds-multiple-links-with-hormones," Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Early in the pandemic, it became clear that males are more susceptible than females to severe COVID-19 and have a higher risk of death from the disease.Among the proposed reasons are higher rates of smoking among males and a greater reluctance to wear a mask, but there may be a more fundamental, biological explanation.SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19, exploits two membrane receptors called ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to break into its host cells.Research suggests that androgens — that is, male sex hormones — increase the production of these receptors in the cells that line the airways of the lungs, which may make it easier for the virus to infect lung tissue in males.Other lines of evidence that implicate male sex hormones include the observation that male pattern baldness, which is caused by high circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), is associated with severe COVID-19 in males.Intriguingly, clinical trials suggest that drugs for treating prostate conditions and male hair loss, which reduce the production of DHT or block the hormone’s receptors, may speed the recovery of people with COVID-19.Leading endocrinologists from Spain, Turkey, and Italy have reviewed the latest evidence on male hormones and several other hormone-related risk factors for COVID-19 in a position statement for the European Society of Endocrinology. The statement updates a previous statement that the society published in March 2020, early in the pandemic.The authors write that physicians should exercise caution when prescribing testosterone — in particular, androgen replacement therapy for male hypogonadism in older patients.They also review the evidence and issue advice for a range of other endocrine conditions, including vitamin D insufficiency, diabetes, obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and issues related to the pituitary and thyroid glands.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Low levels of vitamin D“We need to be aware of the endocrine consequences of COVID-19 for patients with a known endocrine condition, such as diabetes, obesity, or adrenal insufficiency, but also for people without a known condition,” says first author Manuel Puig-Domingo, M.D., Ph.D., from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in Spain.“Vitamin D insufficiency, for example, is very common, and the knowledge that this condition has emerged frequently in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact outcomes should not be taken lightly.”Despite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a hormone precursor.After adjusting for known risk factors, low levels of the vitamin are more prevalent in people hospitalized with COVID-19 than in the general population.Some studies have also found that low vitamin D levels are associated with more severe disease and mortality.The authors recommend that healthcare professionals ensure that their patients have adequate vitamin D levels — in particular, older adults with diabetes or obesity. They observe that home confinement during lockdowns, especially for older adults, may have contributed to worsening levels of vitamin D deficiency in some countries.Worse outcomes for people with diabetesThe endocrinologists note that a large body of published evidence suggests that diabetes, poor management of blood glucose, and obesity are strong risk factors for worse outcomes and mortality in COVID-19.“Active vigilance and testing in outpatient endocrine clinics, as well as early hospitalization for COVID-19 is recommended,” they write.They add that treatment with metformin for type 2 diabetes and statins for high cholesterol are associated with less severe disease and lower risk of death, so these should not be stopped upon admission to the hospital.Beta cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin, may be particularly vulnerable to damage by the virus because they express an abundance of ACE2 receptors.This may partly explain new cases of diabetes following severe COVID-19.The experts say:“Mortality in type 1 or type 2 diabetes has consistently increased during the year of pandemic — and evidence is emerging that a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 may exist, both in terms of worsening existing conditions and new onset of diabetes.”Lockdown may contribute to weight gainAlongside diabetes, obesity has emerged as a major risk factor for COVID-19.The authors write in their paper:“Weight management, blood pressure, and blood glucose control have always been important to improve cardiometabolic health and prevent severe health consequences in obesity, but the risk of severe COVID-19 is now another important reason to focus on these issues.”They caution that lockdown measures, by influencing diet, levels of physical activity, stress, and sleep, may lead to weight gain.“Thus, people with obesity should be encouraged to increase physical activity and gain healthy eating habits, develop strategies to reduce stress and optimize sleep during pandemic,” they write.Direct damage to endocrine glandsIn addition to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas, they write that there is evidence that the virus may directly damage the adrenal, pituitary, and thyroid glands.They review the latest evidence and provide clinical advice for the treatment of conditions related to each of these endocrine organs.Finally, the endocrinologists emphasize that clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in patients with stable diabetes and obesity, compared with healthy subjects. They recommend that vaccination should not be handled differently in patients with stable endocrine diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, Addison disease, pituitary adenomas, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and obesity.However, they note that the treatment of patients with conditions such as Addison disease, in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, may require adjustment to address potential side effects of vaccines, such as fever.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.EndocrinologyCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland on May 25, 2021 — Fact checked by Rita Ponce, Ph.D.Latest newsCould a drug for high blood pressure help slow aging?

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32824674/," Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women. In this perspective, we discuss the available evidence on sex hormones and hormone therapy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and we highlight the possible implications for cancer patients, who can receive hormonal therapies during their treatment plans.",estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females,neutral

Age, Gender and COVID-19: A Complex, Hormone-Driven Interplay



























 December 3, 2020

 Meg Evett, mae5ma@virginia.edu 












Age is a well-known factor that influences the severity and fatality of COVID-19. In addition, male and female patients are known, at least anecdotally, to fare quite differently in the COVID-19 pandemic. Why might this be, and can these observations help guide potential new treatments? Does gender play a fundamental, causal role in disease severity? If so, is there an age-dependency to the gender parameter?More broadly, do age, biological sex and any potential gender-related factors (e.g., therapeutic hormone use) somehow interplay in a way that modulates the severity – and ultimate outcome – of a patient’s COVID-19 infection?Motivated by these questions, Phil Bourne, dean of the University of Virginia’s School of Data Science, and Cam Mura, a senior scientist in the school, are part of an international team that has begun examining these possible interconnections.",male and female,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/sex-and-coronavirus/faq-20486572," The COVID-19 virus can spread through contact with feces. It's possible that you could get the COVID-19 virus from sexual activities that expose you to fecal matter. There is currently no evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids, but the virus has been detected in the semen of people who have or are recovering from the virus. Further research is needed to determine if the COVID-19 virus could be transmitted sexually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Also stay up to date with the COVID-19 vaccines to prevent serious illness.",COVID-19 virus could be transmitted sexually,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.icliniq.com/articles/sexual-health/impact-of-covid-19-on-female-sexual-health," Studies show that many women experience decreased sexual desire or arousal following exposure to COVID-19; this can impact the frequency of wanting sex and how easily one becomes aroused during sex. Conclusion:
The impact of COVID-19 on female sexual health does need further research. Long-term implications and impact are yet to be studied. But it is clear that women have been affected and still face the consequences of COVID-19 on their sexual health. Most of these symptoms resolve after a few months, and many will go away entirely after one year. However, some women will require additional treatment beyond this point to get back on track with their cycles and avoid long-term complications like ovarian cysts or endometriosis later in life.",some women will require additional treatment beyond this point,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-covid-19-affects-womens-sexual-and-reproductive-health," Although there are have been no studies on the impact that such measures might have on the mental health of those refused abortions during COVID-19, there are studies that suggest that unintended pregnancies in general are associated with poor mental health outcomes. In fact, experts have found significant increases in depression both in the short term and in the longer term, nearly 20 years later, in women who had unintended pregnancies.It is worth noting that emerging studies show that women are already at a higher risk of mental health concerns as a result of caring for patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings. This is due to the fact that women tend to dominate healthcare roles.In addition, women provide “unseen” and unpaid care in families, which contributes to this strain. According to a policy brief from the United Nations (UN), “Before COVID-19 became a universal pandemic, women were doing three times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.” Furthermore, the same report also suggests that the school closures during the pandemic “have put additional strain and demand on women and girls,” adding that currently, 1.52 billion students are at home as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, most of the 60 million teachers who are now at home are also women, which compounds the childminding responsibilities that societies have traditionally placed on this gender. In this context, it is essential to remember that the strain on women’s well-being as a result of restricting their access to reproductive health services will likely compound the already existing pressures and expectations they face.Birth control and family planning Abortions are not the only aspect of sexual and reproductive health that the current crisis is affecting.",there are have been no studies,no
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/28/if-oestrogen-can-save-women-from-the-worst-of-covid-they-should-be-given-it," Take the compelling case of the effect of oestrogen, the female hormone, on the coronavirus. Quite simply, research suggests that women with more oestrogen in their bodies are less likely to die and more likely to have milder symptoms of Covid-19. Doctors are also discovering that topping up low hormone levels seems to help some women suffering from long Covid. Yet, this area of research is being sorely neglected. I wonder why?We know that two thirds of coronavirus deaths occur in men. But the female Covid mortality rate starts to rapidly increase as women hit their fifties – after menopause, when their protective hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, drain away.It turns out, however, that women who take either the combined contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy – both of which include oestrogen – have a lower risk of ending up in hospital and of dying.",women with more oestrogen,neutral

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.649128/full," Epidemiologically, men subjects are more prone to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections than women, with a similar scenario being also stated to the previous coronavirus diseases, namely, SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus diseases (MERS-CoV) in 2012. In addition, and despite that aging is regarded as an independent risk factor for the severe form of the disease, even so, women protection is evident. In this way, it has been expected that sex hormones are the main determinant factors in gender differences, with the immunomodulatory effects of estrogen in different viral infections, chiefly in Covid-19, attracting more attention as it might explain the case-fatality rate and predisposition of men for Covid-19 severity. Here, we aim to provide a mini-review and an overview on the protective effects of estrogen in Covid-19. Different search strategies were performed including Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Pubmed, and Google Scholar database to find relative studies. Findings of the present study illustrated that women have a powerful immunomodulating effect against Covid-19 through the effect of estrogen.",women have a powerful immunomodulating effect,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/05/12/gender-coronavirus-female-hormones," (Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images) This article is more than 2 years old.Researchers are now finding more evidence that gender could play a role in who gets sick from the coronavirus. Globally, women who contract COVID-19 have been less likely than men to get really sick or die.This week, researchers in Los Angeles have begun giving male coronavirus patients the hormone progesterone, mainly found in women, to see if that helps them recover.One of the researchers, Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says she began noticing more men than women in the intensive care unit as a result of COVID-19.“The difference is pretty striking,” she says. “There are definitely more men on the ventilators.”Ghandehari believes progesterone might be beneficial because of the hormone’s anti-inflammatory properties, which reduce the inflammatory response of immune cells thus decreasing the “abnormalities” that male coronavirus patients are experiencing.The study is in its infancy stages: 40 men who have tested positive for the coronavirus receive two shots of progesterone for five days.To “really know the results,” Ghandehari says they’ll need to test and evaluate more patients. The research is designed in a randomized format where half receive the hormone treatment and half receive standard care.“The difference is pretty striking.

Female reproductive steroids, estrogen and progesterone and its physiologically active metabolite, allopregnanolone, provide anti-inflammatory functions, reshape competence of immune cells, stimulate antibody production and promote respiratory epithelial cell repair, and inhibit the ACE2 receptor, the door of access for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to infect the organism, suggesting they may protect against COVID-19 symptoms, according to Pinna’s report. The paper is published in Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism. Pinna became interested in the role of reproductive steroids in COVID-19 pathology in March when early case reports showed COVID-19 positive pregnant women who had no COVID-19 symptoms, had escalated symptoms — severe enough to require intensive care — immediately after giving birth. The severity of symptoms coincided with a rapid drop of estradiol, progesterone, and allopregnanolone. “Hormones that help sustain the pregnancy — like progesterone — are 100 times more concentrated in a pregnancy’s third trimester.",they may protect,neutral
Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sex-and-gender-and-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/," This indicates that while women might actually have more side effects as well as report them more often, they also may benefit more from the protective effects of a vaccine. The observations concerning sex, gender, and vaccine response highlight a larger issue concerning how women process and are physiologically affected by medications. The historical gap in research into the possible effects of sex or gender on a drug’s efficacy and safety has too often left women in the dark and sometimes at risk. In fact, as described in a 2001 report, from 1997 to 2000, eight of the 10 drugs removed from the U.S. market posed greater health risks for women than for men. However, more researchers are examining and understanding the factors that confer sex-and-gender differences in drug efficacy and safety during the trial process.

Related: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across speciesThe sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which women produce in larger quantities than men, help to regulate the female immune system and may grant women special resistance against infections and harmful immune system responses, the Times reported. With that in mind, scientists at Cedars-Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University plan to treat small groups of COVID-19 patients with the hormones, to see if they make a difference. ""We may not understand exactly how estrogen works [to counteract COVID-19], but maybe we can see how the patient does,"" Dr. Sharon Nachman, the principal investigator of the Stony Brook University trial, told the Times. The Stony Brook trial will include 110 patients with confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 who develop at least one serious symptom, such as high fever, shortness of breath or pneumonia, but do not yet require mechanical breathing support through intubation, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. All men ages 18 and older may enter the trial, as well as women ages 55 and older (women's estrogen levels tend to decline after menopause.)",maybe we can see how the patient does,neutral

Dr. McCarthy says that while COVID-19 may increase the risk of blood clots, the exact reason for this is unclear. At this point, it can’t be said that if you are on hormonal medication or pregnant, you’re at a greater risk for getting blood clots if you contract the coronavirus. But there are still some factors that we can watch out for. “There are a number factors that may play into this risk, including injury/inflammation to the vessel wall (which leads to a buildup of cells around the injured wall and creation of a blood clot) and increased reactivity of the platelets (which are the clotting cells in the blood). The virus also affects inflammatory and coagulation (clotting) factors that circulate in the blood.",if you are on hormonal medication or pregnant,neutral

If women taking these medications were to become severely ill with COVID-19, then it’s time to consider other options. “There are still no firm guidelines but women not infected who are on HRT or oral contraceptives should consult with their physician regarding potential risk during the pandemic,” says Goldenberg. Mojibian also recommends getting physical exercise as staying home and not moving increases your risk of venous thrombosis. Quitting smoking can also help lower the risk as can a diet low in saturated fat and trans fat.

Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19?,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-cough-syrup-medicine-ingredient-virus-worse," But one medicine
that patients with COVID-19 may be using to treat a
symptom of the disease could make things worse, lab experiments hint. A common ingredient in cough medicines, dextromethorphan,
stimulated the growth
of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey cells in lab dishes, researchers report April 30 in
Nature. Dextromethorphan seems to
activate a cellular stress-coping process that is also exploited by the virus
for its replication. “We’re not necessarily recommending that
everyone stop taking dextromethorphan,” said Brian Shoichet of the University
of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy. This work is only in lab experiments, he
noted during a news briefing on April 30. In people, cough suppressants have
not been shown to make infections worse.",make things worse,neutral
Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19?,https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus-cough-medicine-does-dextromethorphan-help-virus-grow-t180535," “I do think the pro-viral activity observed in vitro merits further controlled clinical study.”Nevan Krogan, who led the research and serves as the director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UC San Francisco, agreed.“This is information we wanted to responsibly report but tempered with a strong caveat that these results were seen in the lab (and) more tests are needed, especially in humans, before any definite conclusions are drawn,” Krogan said.Coronavirus: How to know when to go to the emergency roomMarch 27, 202001:37Dextromethorphan's potential to promote the growth of the virus was observed in monkey cells that were in a lab dish. The effects, if they play out clinically, are likely unique to the new coronavirus and have not been known before, Shoichet noted.It’s not a known side effect of dextromethorphan and researchers have no reason to believe it would affect influenza, for example, he added.The study involved more than 120 scientists from the U.S. and Europe who are searching for potential treatments for COVID-19.They created a blueprint of more than 300 human proteins that the virus requires to infect human cells, then looked at which existing drugs — or those in development — might target those proteins, UCSF said in a news release. They found a number with the potential to treat COVID-19.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & WellnessCDC adds 6 new coronavirus symptoms to its listDrugs that showed antiviral activity against the new coronavirus in lab experiments included zotatifin, which is currently in clinical trials for cancer; ternatin-4/plitidepsin, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma; haloperidol, which is used to treat schizophrenia; the antihistamines clemastine and cloperastine; and the female hormone progesterone.A preclinical compound (a drug not yet approved for any condition and for which there's no human clinical data yet) called PB28 had about 20 times greater antiviral activity in lab experiments than hydroxychloroquine, which is being studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19.The researchers caution the promising drugs in the analysis have only been tested against the new coronavirus in lab experiments so human clinical trials would be needed to make sure they’re safe and effective. Until then, the authors don’t advocate anyone prescribing or using the drugs to treat COVID-19.The study “will help to focus clinical trials toward the most promising agents” to combat the virus, Krogan said in a statement.A.

Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19?,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a32343488/cough-medication-syrup-covid-19/," This research specifically looked at medications with dextromethorphan, which acts as a suppressant. The study didn't find that that the drug would make COVID-19 worse, increase your chances of developing COVID-19, or otherwise harm you in any way. It's just currently a finding from research that was conducted in monkeys, and it's important to note that animal findings often don't hold true in humans. Still, the authors suggest being cautious about dextromethorphan. ""By the same standard, we find that the widely used antitussive dextromethorphan harbors proviral activity and therefore its use should merit caution and further study in the context of COVID-19,"" they write.

Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19?,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-30/why-you-should-avoid-cough-syrup-if-you-think-youve-got-the-coronavirus," But the researchers said the findings are concerning enough for them to advise cough sufferers who might be infected with coronavirus to avoid these medications.Given that cough suppressants are likely to be widely used by people with coronavirus infections — whether they’ve got an official diagnosis or not — the researchers called for more research on dextromethorphan’s safety. Dextromethorphan stifles signals in the brain that set off the reflex to cough. It is a key ingredient of virtually all over-the-counter cough and cold formulations, including those sold as Robitussin, Benylyn, DayQuil/NyQuil, Delsym, Triaminic, and Theraflu.In tests conducted at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, researchers found that when dextromethorphan was introduced into the cells of African green monkeys growing in petri dishes, the subsequent addition of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in more prolific viral growth.UC San Francisco pharmacologist Nevan J. Krogan, one of the team’s leaders, said that the group had alerted officials overseeing the government’s COVID-19 response to its concerns.The findings were reported Thursday in the journal Nature.

                  A common ingredient found in many over-the-counter cough and cold medications including Benylin and Night Nurse could cause the coronavirus to multiply, a study has revealed. The discovery was made as part of a global study into pre-existing drugs and ways they could be used to treat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.An international team of scientists found that dextromethorphan, a common active ingredient in cough suppressants, might cause SARS-CoV-2 pathogens to replicate.While this doesn't mean conditions will always get worse, or lead to a higher risk of severe symptoms, researchers warned against using medication with the ingredient.They say more research is needed into the impact of the ingredient on humans with COVID-19 before it should be used to treat a cough from coronavirus. An international team of scientists found that dextromethorphan, a common active ingredient in cough suppressants, can cause COVID-19 to replicate faster'We've identified an over-the-counter medication that appears to be pro-viral - actively promoting infection - that people I think need to be aware of,' said Professor Nevin Krogan, of the University of California at San Francisco. 'If I had Covid-19 I would think twice about using cough syrups,' added Krogan. Dextromethorphan is used by cough and cold medication manufacturers to stifle the signals in the brain that set off the reflex to cough.The team say that due to its use in almost all common cough syrups, it is likely to be used by people to settle the cough that is a main symptom of coronavirus.",multiplying fasterThey,neutral

An ingredient found in everyday cold medicine appears to promote infection from the coronavirus, according to a new lab study looking at the impact of over-the-counter and prescription drugs on the coronavirus, led by virus experts at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes. Researchers found that dextromethorphan — found in most over-the-counter cough syrups tablets and gel capsules — caused SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to grow more in a lab setting. The scientists initially said people who have COVID-19 should be cautious about using cold medication that contains the drug until more studies are conducted. “Obviously, if you have COVID-19, you're coughing and you're reaching on the shelf for the cough syrup,” said Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UCSF and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. “We're throwing out a caveat here, at least in the laboratory setting -- in the context of this drug, you actually see increased infection.”

Masks may be more effective as a “source control” because they can prevent larger expelled droplets from evaporating into smaller droplets that can travel farther. Another factor to remember, noted Rutherford, is that you could still catch the virus through the membranes in your eyes, a risk that masking does not eliminate.

Wearing a mask in public has now become part of our daily routine. Many communities across the country mandate that face masks be worn inside public buildings and even outside if social distancing isn’t possible. Because people can spread the virus even before they have COVID-19 symptoms, having everyone wear masks can prevent asymptomatic people from spreading the virus to others. Now, a new study suggests that universal masking may also reduce the amount of virus in the air—potentially leading to milder or even asymptomatic infections. Researchers say that if everyone wears masks, these reduced exposures to the virus could lead to greater community-level immunity and slow the spread of COVID-19 until an effective vaccine is developed. In this Q&A, infectious disease epidemiologist Chris Beyrer, MD, MPH ’91, Desmond M. Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an author of the study, explains the implications of widespread masking.",can prevent asymptomatic people from spreading the virus to others,neutral

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-might-face-masks-reduce-covid-19-severity," Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Researchers have found that wearing a mask increases the humidity of the air a person breathes in.They suggest this may explain why mask-wearing has links with reduced COVID-19 severity.The research, which appears in the Biophysical Journal, adds further evidence for the value of wearing masks.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Do masks reduce COVID-19 severity?Face masks have been a crucial non-pharmaceutical intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers believe they reduce the chances of a person passing the virus to another person, as well as acquiring the virus themselves.Further, while healthcare professionals continue administering effective vaccines around the world, mask-wearing is still necessary.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) point out there is not yet enough information on how these vaccines work in the real-world to recommend people stop wearing masks, even for those who have received two doses of the vaccines.Recent research, which appears in the Journal of General Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine, found that face masks effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and may also reduce its severity.The researchers behind the articles suggest this is due to mask-wearers likely having exposure to reduced amounts of the virus. However, other scientists have contested this finding.The researchers behind the present study are also skeptical that exposure to a small amount of the virus may account for a mask-wearer to have a less severe case of COVID-19.Instead, they suggest the answer may lie in the humidity of the air that a person breathes while wearing a mask.Humidity and disease severityThe researchers note that respiratory viruses, such as the common cold and influenza, often follow a seasonal pattern, with an increase in cases during the winter months. Some evidence also suggests this holds true with COVID-19.Many factors may account for this, such as:people spending more time indoors, where aerosols containing the virus can build uppeople with a vitamin D deficiencylower general levels of ultraviolet light, which may inactivate the virusthe virus being able to last longer in colder, less humid airThe researchers also point out that cold, less humid air can affect the physiology of the organism a virus might infect, inducing more severe infections. For example, researchers found that mice in low humidity developed more severe cases of influenza.The researchers suggest that increased humidity may reduce the dehydration of a person’s lungs that can often occur during cold weather. They also believe increased humidity may improve a person’s mucociliary clearance — the way the lungs remove mucus and harmful particles.Both of these could mean a reduction in the severity of a COVID-19 infection.As a result, the researchers wanted to see whether the reduction in disease severity associated with mask-wearing could, in principle, be explained by masks increasing the humidity of the air a person breathes.Mask types testedTo find out if masks increase the humidity of the air a person breathes, the researchers asked participants to breathe into a sealed steel box wearing one of four common types of mask: N-95 respiratorsurgical maskcotton-polyester maskheavy cotton maskThe researchers then measured the box’s humidity, comparing this to the humidity measured when a person breathed into the box without wearing a mask.This told the researchers how much moisture was being trapped by the mask, condensing on the inside of the mask and then evaporating and entering a person’s lungs as they inhaled.The scientists carried out the test at three temperatures between 46–98oF (8–37°C).Increased humidityThe researchers found that all the masks increased the humidity of the air being inhaled by the participants, particularly at lower temperatures.",humidity,neutral

Masks are one component of a package of prevention and control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. In addition to mask wearing, these measures include avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and improving ventilation in indoor spaces, keeping a distance, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette - covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze, getting vaccinated and staying up to date with booster doses. Be supportive of others wearing a mask if they choose to. When should masks be worn by the public?

A previous version of this article was based on expert guidance at the time of publication, but as the COVID-19 pandemic has grown in the U.S. in recent weeks, public health thinking around wearing face masks has changed. On March 30, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was reviewing its guidelines for face masks, citing data showing that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are infected but not exhibiting symptoms. Then, on April 3, President Donald Trump announced that the CDC is changing its guidance to include a recommendation that all Americans wear non-medical masks, or fabric that covers a person’s face and nose, when they leave their house.

Specifically, a natural experiment across 200 countries showed 45.7% fewer covid-19 related mortality in countries where mask-wearing was mandatory. Another natural experiment study in the US reported a 29% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as the time-varying reproductive number Rt) (risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.75) in states where mask-wearing was mandatory.

More research is needed to determine the effectiveness — or lack thereof — of those neck fleeces and Dr. Dweik agrees. The bottom line: masks work
The neck fleece results aside, one thing does become clear when reading the study: properly wearing a mask over your nose and mouth can help to stop the spread of the coronavirus when paired with other safe practices like social distancing and regularly washing your hands. Even if you don’t have symptoms, Dr. Dweik says you should still follow those guidelines because of how many cases have been asymptomatic. “Taken together, I think, these are very powerful in preventing the spread of infection,” he adds. “Each one alone is good but not sufficient. If you do them all, you minimize your risk of spreading or getting the disease much more than just each one by itself.”

Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as ""flattening the curve,"" which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

So, the question remains, should YOU cancel upcoming events such as weddings, parties, birthdays and cookouts? The short answer is: You should at least consider it.How is Coronavirus Spread?COVID-19 is believed to be spread by respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. Person-to-person infections typically happen in close contact (about 6 feet or closer). New information also indicates that the virus could be passed from person to person through community spread. Community spread is when a patient is infected without a relevant travel history or without known contact to another infected patient.",people of all ages should consider social distancing,neutral

Social distancing for COVID-19 disease can protect health care workers, limit overcrowding of hospitals and ICUs, help to slow a shortage of much needed health care equipment. As many people are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, social distancing can protect the high-risk groups, such as the elderly, and those with heart and lung disease. Most important, social distancing can protect you, and your family, from a virus that has no approved treatment or vaccines, yet. Social distancing can buy time for the development of an effective preventive and treatment for this novel virus.

Can social distancing prevent COVID-19?,https://health.usnews.com/conditions/articles/flattening-the-curve-why-social-distancing-is-important-to-combat-covid-19," Without sweeping social distancing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, hospitals will run out of intensive care beds and ventilators, and staff won't be able to keep up with the needs of sick patients. More health care workers themselves will fall ill, and there will be fewer on the front lines to combat COVID-I9.Those who heed social-distancing and quarantine recommendations are decreasing the opportunity for person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, for which there is currently no proven cure or vaccine. In short, experts say, social distancing is our one and only big hope for intervening early enough to dramatically reduce the spread of the disease and deaths. Whether successful or not, the impact will be felt most among vulnerable populations, including adults over 60 and those with chronic disease, like diabetes and heart disease.

Can social distancing work or there are better ways to lower COVID-19 spread?Coronavirus can travel further than 10 meters in the air when infected people breathe out the droplets, cough, sneeze, or even just talk.The virus droplet are very small and so they can spread further than the recent social distancing measurements.Although this looks frightening, the virus has to overcome many obstacles in order to infect a person.Viruses are known to travel by aerosol but in fact plenty of them are damaged in the air, therefore only a small percentage of viruses in exhaled breath remain infectious (Milton et al., 2013).An experimental study by Doremalen et al. (2020) found that once the SARS-CoV-2 virus has left the body it remains active for 3 hours, while another study suggests 16 hours (Fears et al., 2020).These studies were done in the lab and are not true reflections of human exhaled conditions and it is still the case that the virus declines in a short period of time.The other factor is that the chance of inhaling airborne virus droplets is higher in crowded places or close contact less than 2 meters from an infected person.A new petition signed by 239 scientists points out that the virus aerosols can travel further than the current social distancing rules, suggesting measures should be taken in preventing the airborne transmission of Covid-19.Professor Lidia Morawska who led the signatories, said:“Studies by the signatories and other scientists have demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are exhaled in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air and pose a risk of exposure beyond 1 to 2m by an infected person.At typical indoor air velocities, a 5-micron droplet will travel tens of meters, much greater than the scale of a typical room while settling from a height of 1.5m above the floor.”Researchers suggest that the risk of Covid-19 airborne transmission is nearly 19 times higher indoors than in open-air places (Nishiura et al., 2020).Many indoor places lack decent ventilation and the air becomes stagnant, increasing the infection risk.The signatories highlight some practical measures as previously suggested by other studies including (Kumar & Morawska, 2020):Install ample and proper building ventilation to provide clean outdoor air and filter air, especially in hospitals, public buildings, care homes, workplace, and schools.Add airborne infection controls, like high efficiency air filtration, local exhaust, and germicidal ultraviolet lights.Overcrowding in public buildings and on public transport should be avoided.The authors write:“These are practical and can be easily implemented and many are not costly.For example, simple steps such as opening both doors and windows can dramatically increase air flow rates in many buildings.Numerous health authorities currently focus on hand-washing, maintaining social distancing, and droplet precautions.Hand-washing and social distancing are appropriate, but it is view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.”“It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19” is published in the journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases (Morawska et al., 2020).Get free email updatesA new psych study by email every day.

Can vinegar prevent COVID-19?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/can-a-supplement-protect-me-against-the-new-coronavirus/," A group of researchers in Ireland conducted a similar analysis and reached the same conclusion, according to another press release in May.It’s worth noting that neither group’s data has yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. And the findings only identify a potential relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes in groups of people (neither group looked at an individual’s vitamin D levels and connected it to his or her COVID-19 outcome). Additional research in randomized controlled trials that track individuals’ vitamin D levels and how they specifically fare with COVID-19 will need to be done to more conclusively prove the role vitamin D, and specifically vitamin D supplement intake, plays in response to the virus.What the collective evidence points to is that being deficient in vitamin D may hamper immune function and your body’s ability to protect itself against COVID-19. If you’re not deficient, vitamin D supplementation won’t really provide a lot of additional benefit, but if you are deficient, taking the supplement (or increasing dietary intake and healthy sun exposure) can strengthen immunity, says Cooperman.Apple cider vinegar Though apple cider vinegar (ACV) does boast some other health benefits, there isn’t evidence to show that ACV affects immune function or that taking it regularly improves your chances of fighting off viruses, Lin says.Turmeric While there is some evidence turmeric may yield some health benefits, including help with high cholesterol management, glucose control, and digestive issues, there isn’t specific evidence that it can help fight off a virus, says Lin.

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy.

In August 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for the treatment, but some questioned whether it was politically motivated and whether the data really showed that it worked.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/early-treatment-convalescent-plasma-covid-19-doesnt-show-benefit," It’s sometimes known as “survivor’s plasma.” Treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma infusions was thought to help fight the virus. In theory, it could speed recovery by transferring antibodies that could block the virus. The approach is called passive immunization. Studies had suggested that convalescent plasma treatment might lower the risk of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients if administered early in the disease—before mechanical assistance was needed to help them breathe. Based on such findings, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, in 2020 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. The FDA concluded that its known and potential benefits outweighed its risks.",it could speed recovery by transferring antibodies that could block the virus,neutral
Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-applications-inds-cber-regulated-products/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma," Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral
Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/convalescent-plasma-therapy-provides-limited-success-in-treating-covid-19/," But since the therapy’s emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2020, its supposed benefits have been met with scrutiny by some researchers.To investigate the success of convalescent plasma therapy in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19, a team of researchers from seven institutions came together, including Alessandro Santin, MD, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, and Mahalia Desruisseaux, MD, associate professor of internal medicine (infectious disease), who led the portion of the clinical trial done at Yale School of Medicine. While the therapy, the team found, provided no improvement in the overall survival of COVID-19 patients says Santin, it shouldn’t be ruled out in early pandemic cases where no other treatment options are available. The team reported their results in JAMA Internal Medicine on December 13.“This is one of the largest double-blind prospective randomized studies ever done on COVID-19 for patients with severe disease,” says Santin.Convalescent plasma therapy involves health professionals collecting antibodies that fight diseases such as COVID-19 through extracting blood plasma from donors who have survived the disease. By providing patients with these borrowed antibodies that are specific against the variant spreading in the population at a specific time point, the goal of the therapy is to give sufferers of the disease what scientists refer to as “passive immunity.” The use of convalescent plasma therapy dates back to the 1918 Spanish flu and has been used over the last century to fight outbreaks including the smaller SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003. ""The bottom line is that the evidence showed during both the Spanish flu 100 years ago and SARS-COV-1 that fewer people were dying after being treated with convalescent plasma,” says Santin.The clinical trial, known as CONTAIN COVID-19, began in April 2020, during the early days of the pandemic in the United States. The study began by enrolling hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients in New York City, but would soon expand to include patients in 21 hospitals affiliated with seven centers across the country, including Yale School of Medicine.",reducing the severity and mortality,neutral

Stephen M. Hahn, M.D., FDA Commissioner:
“I am committed to releasing safe and potentially helpful treatments for COVID-19 as quickly as possible in order to save lives. We’re encouraged by the early promising data that we’ve seen about convalescent plasma. The data from studies conducted this year shows that plasma from patients who’ve recovered from COVID-19 has the potential to help treat those who are suffering from the effects of getting this terrible virus,” said Dr. Hahn. “At the same time, we will continue to work with researchers to continue randomized clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating patients infected with the novel coronavirus.”
Scientific Evidence on Convalescent Plasma
Based on an evaluation of the EUA criteria and the totality of the available scientific evidence, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research determined that the statutory criteria for issuing an EUA criteria were met. The FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in lessening the severity or shortening the length of COVID-19 illness in some hospitalized patients. The agency also determined that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product and that that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative treatments.",help treat those who are suffering from the effects of getting this terrible virus,neutral

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/using-convalescent-blood-to-treat-covid-19-is-it-possible," This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently.Recently, researchers and healthcare professionals have been looking into the possibility of using this method to treat people with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In the United States, a group of researchers and doctors from 57 institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are investigating and applying convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.This is a concerted initiative — called the “National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project” — born after the publication of a viewpoint paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation in March, 2020.The paper argued for the potential merits of passive antibody therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. It was authored by immunologists Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of the Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.To understand more about convalescent plasma therapy, its merits, its risks, and its current use in COVID-19 treatments, Medical News Today recently spoke to Dr. Casadevall.Here is what he told us, alongside more information on the current state of convalescent plasma therapy.A therapy ‘used for over 100 years’So, where did the idea of using convalescent plasma, or passive antibody therapy, come from?This notion was first introduced in the late 19th century when physiologist Emil von Behring and bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburou discovered that they could use antibodies present in serum — another blood component — to fight the bacterial infection diptheria.Since then, doctors have used passive antibody therapy, on and off, at least since the 1930s to treat or prevent both bacterial and viral infections, including forms of pneumonia, meningitis, and measles.When we asked him how the idea of using convalescent plasma therapy to treat COVID-19 came about, Dr. Casadevall told us: “I have worked on antibodies my entire life professional life […], and I knew that convalescent plasma — or sera […] — was being used for over 100 years.”“In fact, the first Nobel Prize was given [to Behring] for the use of serum to treat diphtheria, so I knew the history.” This long history of successfully using this method against different infectious diseases suggested that it might also be effective against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.“I knew that in epidemics when you don’t have a lot of things, […] the blood of those who recover can have antibodies that can be used [as treatment],” Dr. Casadevall explained.“So it’s an old idea, it’s been around for a long time, and I think that my contribution was, in fact, to alert my friends, authorities, that this [therapy] could be used in this epidemic.”Recent research has already shown that people who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 have developed antibodies that can react to the coronavirus.“There [are] now multiple studies that have shown that when people recover from the virus, they have in their blood neutralizing antibodies that are able to kill the virus,” Dr. Casadevall also told MNT.Although “[p]eople differ greatly in the amount of antibodies that they make — some make large amounts, some make small amounts — […] the good news is that most have [them],” he added.Given the willingness of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate blood, the method seems feasible right now. In fact, some doctors are already using convalescent plasma therapy in some cases.Settling the matter of safetyIn the U.S., the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project have already been trialing this method as widely as possible.Dr. Casadevall told MNT that “in the United States, we have close to 12,000” people who have received the convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19.Based on the data obtained from a little less than half of this cohort, Dr. Casadevall and his colleagues have concluded that this approach is safe for the patients receiving treatment — the first step necessary before ascertaining the method’s effectiveness.The team has reported these findings in a preprint that they have made available online.“[On May 14], we put out a paper on the first 5,000 [patients] showing that [this therapy] was relatively safe. That’s the first step,” Dr. Casadevall explained.“You want to show safety. And then the question of efficacy will be coming in the next few weeks.",This can help their immune systems reject the pathogen more efficiently,neutral

Research on convalescent plasma use in COVID patients has produced mixed results.

NIH Says No Benefit of Convalescent Plasma as COVID-19 Treatment



In early December, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against using convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19, except in clinical trials. Likewise, the use of convalescent plasma is not allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for outpatient use except, again, in clinical trials.

Brief Summary:
Natural products with immunomodulation and antiviral activity showed a promising improvement in the outcomes of some viral infectious diseases both in preclinical and primitive clinical studies. The aim of this study is to utilize Saudi FDA licensed Nigella sativa (NS) seed oil towards improving disease outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with mild COVID-19. The study will be a prospective, open-label, non-randomized controlled pilot trial. Patients will be supplemented (add-on) with one capsule of black seed oil twice daily for 10 days. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who clinically recovered on day 14.",Saudi,no

Severe side affects are rare, though they may occur. This includes a possible allergic reaction.In this article, we look at the science behind black seed oil’s benefits and explore the possible side effects and risks.What is black seed oil?Black seeds are also known as black caraway, black cumin, kalonji, and black onion seeds.They come from Nigella sativa, a small plant with pale purple, blue, or white flowers that grows in Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and the Middle East.People have used the tiny black seeds of N. sativa fruits as a natural remedy for thousands of years. The seeds can also flavor curries, pickles, and bread in a similar way to cumin or oregano.Black seed oil contains thymoquinone, which is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that may also have tumor-reducing properties.People can ingest black seed oil in the form of capsules or apply it topically to benefit the skin. It is also possible to add the oil to massage oils, shampoos, homemade skincare products, and fragrances.High quality black seed oil is also suitable for use in cooking, baking, and beverages.Benefits of black seed oilScientists with a range of specialties have researched the possible benefits of black seed oil.However, it is important to note that many studies to date have used cells or animals as models, and there is limited research available on the effects of black seed oil in humans.Benefits for weight lossA review of 11 studies has shown that black seed supplementation may help lower people’s body mass index (BMI) and lower people’s waist circumference. The study participants did not report any severe side effects from taking this supplement.A 2021 study on rats fed a high fat diet shows that black seed oil may be able to help significantly decrease body weight and insulin resistance.",Dermatology & SkincareDiabetesEnvironment,no
Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/black-seed-oil," Black seed oil has also been shown to have antifungal activities. In particular, it may protect against Candida albicans, which is a yeast that can lead to candidiasis (46, 47).While early research shows promise in the applications of black seed oil, more studies in humans are needed to confirm these effects and the optimal dosage. summaryBlack seed oil is high in antioxidants and may have several benefits for health. These include the treatment of asthma and various skin conditions, lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, aiding in weight loss, and protecting brain health.Potential side effects and safety concernsWhen used in small amounts for cooking, black seed oil is likely safe for most people. However, there’s limited research on the long-term safety of consuming larger doses for therapeutic purposes.",more studies in humans are needed to confirm these effects and the optimal dosage,neutral
Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://guardian.ng/features/health/green-tea-honey-black-seed-validated-as-covid-19-cures/," Top on the list is that a combination of honey and black seed helped with symptoms alleviation and viral clearance and reduced mortality in patients with moderate and severe coronavirus disease. Also, studies have shown that gargling with green tea extracts, or plant juices can lower flu infections and viral symptoms. Similarly, chokeberry or pomegranate juices could be used against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, in addition to teas. Researchers also found that lemon juice and palm oil extract could prevent and treat liver damage from excessive alcohol consumption even as chili pepper could reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 26 per cent. Meanwhile, German researchers have established the association between severe respiratory infection caused by SARS CoV-2 and factors such as age, body mass index (BMI) and ABO blood group. Also, Nigerian researchers at an online event to celebrate the 11th anniversary of HerbFEST (a herb and natural expo), on Tuesday, November 10, 2020, brainstormed on herbal medicine and dietary supplements for the treatment of COVID-19.",Nigerian researchers,no

                            A randomised-controlled trial that is awaiting peer review suggests that Covid-19 patients who received a combination of honey and Nigella sativa recovered more quickly than those given a placebo. Treatment with honey and Nigella sativa (also known as black cumin) was found to alleviate Covid-19 symptoms within six days, compared to 13 days in the control group.In addition, subjects on the honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) treatment achieved a negative PCR test - used to diagnose Covid-19 - about four days earlier than subjects without the treatment.According to the researchers, this is the first such trial studying a combination of HNS in Covid-19 patients.The paper is published on the preprint server, medRxiv and has not yet been peer-reviewed yet.Dr Sohaib Ashraf, who is the principal investigator of this study, and a research fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA told NutraIngredients-Asia​: “When COVID-19 struck in late March, soon it was clear to us that this disease is going to cause havoc across the globe and will act as a reset button for world economy​.So, we ​searched for clinical trials published regarding proven efficacy of any drug against COVID-19 but unfortunately, we identified no drug proven effective against COVID-19. ​“We searched on scientific literature for any miracle drug that can be globally accessible with wide range efficacy against viruses and other microbes along with anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, anti-coagulant properties and wide range of safety profile. In that search, we found honey and Nigella sativa were a perfect fit.”​Researchers said both honey and Nigella sativa show similar pharmacological profiles with its anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory effects especially in upper respiratory tract infections.“We reasoned that the combination could be more effective in attenuating severity of the disease, controlling viral replication and curing COVID-19 patients​,” they wrote.Study design​The trial was conducted between May to July 2020 as an urgent study during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan.In total, 313 patients were enrolled in the RCT, and recruited from four medical care facilities in Lahore, Pakistan.210 subjects were categorised as moderate cases, identified by cough, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath, while 103 subjects were severe cases, identified by fever, cough, pneumonia, and respiratory distress.The subjects were randomised into the treatment or placebo group.In the treatment group, subjects were given honey (1g/kg/day) and Nigella sativa (80mg/kg/day) for up to 13 days.These were given two to three times a day depending on the patient’s comfort. Honey was dissolved in 250mL of warm water, while Nigella sativa was provided in capsules.Both honey and Nigella sativa were provided by Smile Welfare Organization, a non-profitable organisation based in Pakistan.The control group received empty capsules.In addition, all Covid-19 patients received standard care therapy as advised by the physician, comprising of anti-pyretic drugs, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation if required.Subjects were assessed for clinical symptoms daily for 13 days, and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests if found to remain asymptomatic for at least 48 hours.For patients who were discharged before day 13 or were home-quarantined, the follow-up was done by telemedicine.The primary outcomes were viral clearance (negative PCR test) and alleviation of symptoms.",Honey and black cumin seed,no

According to an in vitro study posted on Dec. 21 that has not been peer-reviewed, researchers from Northwestern University and Utah State University tested the effectiveness of an over-the-counter nasal spray known as Xlear Sinus Care against cultures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID. Ingredients of the spray include 11 percent xylitol—which is a chemical compound typically used as a sweetener that study authors report has reduced the severity of viral infections—as well as .2 percent grapefruit seed extract (GSE) and .85 percent saline. The results showed that after 25 minutes of contact time, the amount of active virus was dramatically reduced by the GSE and had been neutralized by xylitol. ""Combination therapy with GSE and xylitol may prevent spread of viral respiratory infections not just for SAR-CoV-2 but also for future H1N1 or other viral epidemics. GSE significantly reduces the viral load while xylitol prevents the virus attachment to the core protein on the cell wall,"" the study authors wrote.

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.uts.edu.au/news/health-science/promising-new-treatment-covid-19-infection," The seeds of the plant, Nigella Sativa, have been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for multiple medical conditions, including inflammation and infections. Now, an Australian-first research review article has found it could be used to treat COVID-19. “There is growing evidence from modelling studies that thymoquinone, an active ingredient of Nigella Sativa, more commonly known as the Fennel Flower, can stick to the COVID- 19 virus spike protein and stop the virus from causing a lung infection. “It may also block the ‘cytokine’ storm that affects seriously ill patients who are hospitalised with COVID-19,” said Professor Kaneez Fatima Shad, lead author of a recently published comprehensive review article in the prestigious journal, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology. Thymoquinone has been extensively studied in laboratories, including animal studies. These studies have shown that thymoquinone can moderate our immune system in a good way, by preventing pro-inflammation chemicals such as interleukins from been released.",thymoquinone,neutral

Currently, there are no studies testing if oregano essential oil can prevent or treat COVID-19. ""There have been no essential oil studies with COVID-19 at all,"" says Dr. Swindells. See what pharmacist Ally Dering-Anderson, PharmD, says about the safety and usefulness of essential oils. The bottom line is that none of these supplements have shown efficacy against COVID-19 yet. So if you'd like to take supplemental vitamins, check with your primary care provider first.

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2020/05/45-more-companies-get-coronavirus-warning-letters," In marketing materials, the Oregon business has stated, “Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19 is a great option for prevention, suspected exposure, early-stage and mild symptoms that can be treated at home.” In addition, “starting an herbal formula early in treatment may help to keep your respiratory illness from progressing to a more severe stage.”
Integrative Acupuncture. The Vermont company has promoted its products and services by representing that “Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complete system of medicine that provides prevention as well as treatment” and “so in this fight with the insidious and novel Coronavirus, Chinese Medicine . . . should take a primary role in effective treatment.”
NothingsIncurable.com. In marketing materials titled “How to Protect Yourself From the Coronavirus,” the company has claimed that an ingredient in its Powdered Black Seeds “will literally make you invulnerable” to “contagious pathogens.” As an affiliate marketer, the company also has stated that people can “defeat the cold or flu, or anything bacterial or viral related with Wild Harvested Oil of Oregano.”
Acupuncture & Natural Health Solutions. Based in Naples, Florida, the company has marketed “COVID-19 Homeopathy Treatment Kits,” claiming they are “effective for 80% of people.”
Naturments. In promotions for Black Seed Oil – which the Florida company has claimed is “believed to be the miracle cure for all diseases except death” – Naturments has made representations like this: “In an attempt to prevent COVID-19 duplication and possibly kill it, a study was made where it was found” that certain extracts “could decrease the virus load when any of them were added to the coronavirus infected cells.”

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/11/instagram-posts/theres-no-scientific-evidence-support-these-supple/," Black seed oil
People selling black seed oil — extracted from Nigella sativa, or black cumin seeds — as a COVID-19 treatment have also come under federal scrutiny. In a May warning letter to a company encouraging consumers to fight the coronavirus with black seed oil, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote that no reliable scientific evidence supported claims that black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19. The FDA has sent similar warning letters to companies selling black seed oil to treat or prevent COVID-19 as recently as September. The Journal of Pharmacopuncture, which is focused in part on alternative medicines, published an article in June on Nigella sativa as a ""potential herb for COVID-19,"" but its conclusion was far from the claim in the Instagram post, saying that such a supplement ""may reduce the adverse effects of conventional medicines"" but that randomized controlled trials were needed to determine any benefits in treating COVID-19 patients. Our ruling
A post on Instagram discourages people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine and instead advocates for ""naturopathic solutions,"" including vitamins D and C, colloidal silver and black seed oil. While research into some supplements like vitamin D has seemed promising, subsequent studies have questioned whether it can protect against COVID-19.",black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19,yes

 A recent study published in the journal Chemrxiv has demonstrated how compounds from black seed inhibit COVID-19. The study titled “Identification of Compounds from Nigella Sativa as New Potential Inhibitors of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Molecular Docking Study” was conducted by Salim Bouchentouf Noureddine Missoum. The study noted: “The spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of specific treatment and the urgent situation requires use of all resources to remedy this scourge. In the present study, using molecular docking, we identify new probable inhibitors of COVID-19 by molecules from Nigella sativa L, which is highly reputed healing herb in North African societies and both Islamic and Christian traditions. The discovery of the Mpro protease structure in COVID-19 provides a great opportunity to identify potential drug candidates for treatment. Focusing on the main proteases in CoVs (3CLpro/Mpro) (PDB ID 6LU7 and 2GTB); docking of compounds from Nigella Sativa and drugs under clinical test was performed using Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE).",compounds from black seed inhibit COVID-19,neutral

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is being used in conjunction with other medicines in a number of clinical trials for patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus). Results of one study show Covid-19 patients treated with oseltamivir had a significantly shorter stay in the hospital and significantly lower death rate compared to the control group. This study did have limitations, and the authors noted that more prospective studies need to be done to clarify the clinical benefit of oseltamivir with other antiviral and combination therapies.",Is Tamiflu used to treat COVID-19,neutral

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called ""Tamiflu approach"" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston.

Tamiflu is a brand (trade) name for oseltamivir. Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is an antiviral agent that may be used to treat acute and uncomplicated infections due to influenza A or B viruses in people who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. The manufacturer suggests oseltamivir works by inhibiting viral neuraminidase, an enzyme that enables viruses to be released from their host cell. However, a Cochrane review suggests oseltamivir reduces symptoms of influenza by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which reduces the immune response. It may also work centrally (through the brain) to lower temperature. The Cochrane reviewers did not find any evidence of influenza-virus-specific action.",by inhibiting viral neuraminidase,neutral

They gave each of them two spritzes of the XClear Sinus Care nasal spray per nostril every six hours. The results showed that each patient ""demonstrated an improvement in the symptoms and a reduction in the clinical course post use of xylitol plus GSE in the form of a nasal spray, commercially available as Xlear nasal spray, as an adjunct to their ongoing treatment.""

Gareth IacobucciThe BMJThe UK government has made a huge investment in antivirals to fight covid, but some experts are concerned the waste and overspending of the 2000s will recur. Gareth Iacobucci reportsThe government’s Antivirals Taskforce has procured more antivirals per population than any other country in Europe, with over 4.98 million courses ordered so far.1 Included within this is 2.75 million courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral drug Paxlovid (a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets).Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, has estimated, using publicly available drug prices in the US, that the UK has spent £2.2bn (€2.6bn; $2.8bn) so far on procuring antivirals. “There’s a vast amount of money involved,” he told The BMJ. “As usual, all government contracts are confidential, so maybe they got some discount.",Stockpiling antivirals,neutral

Already favipiravir has been studied in the United States for treating influenza and it didn’t work better than the current drug for that illness, oseltamivir (Tamiflu). But those tests in more than 3,000 people showed that the drug has few side effects. Maldonado and colleagues will enroll patients within 72 hours of getting a positive COVID-19 test. Participants will take the pills twice a day for 10 days, and nasal swabs will be used to determine whether the drug is reducing the amount of virus the person is producing, which may stop transmission to others. “We’re excited because we need drugs that inhibit the virus directly,” Maldonado says.",the drug has few side effects,neutral

The flu fighter Tamiflu is one of the most recognizable antiviral medications in the world -- but its weaknesses suggest that devising a similarly simple treatment for Covid-19 will be challenging. After spending some $20 billion to develop vaccines at top speed, the U.S. is turning its attention to treating Covid-19 after a person is infected. Last week, health officials said the Antiviral Program for Pandemics will use $3.2 billion to target drugs for Covid and other viruses with the potential to foment pandemics. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious-disease official and adviser to President Joe Biden, compared the hoped-for drugs to Tamiflu, which was used in 2009 to counter a milder pandemic of swine flu. But that medication's history shows the pitfalls of expecting antivirals to contain an explosive infection like Covid.",Covid-19,neutral

It proved as effective as a preventive drug for infection and also decreased virus replication and spread after infection.The findings are reported in the journal Virology. ""The goal of this research is to develop a Neem-based medication that can reduce the risk of serious illness when someone is infected with coronaviruses,"" said study co-author Maria Nagel, research professor in the department of neurology and ophthalmology at the varsity's School of Medicine. ""We hope that scientists won't have to continuously develop new therapies every time a new SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges.",coronavirus,no

Some are thought to enhance the immune system and put the body in a healthier position to fight infections. Others are believed to be powerful antivirals that block certain viruses from replicating in the body.But just because we’ve seen some promise with other illnesses does not mean people should assume herbal remedies provide the same benefit with COVID-19.Every virus is unique in its structure and behavior. The herbs that seem to work for other viral infections will need to be tested to see if they also hold up against COVID-19. “This one’s a little bit more of a dangerous virus,” said Jeffrey Langland, PhD, an assistant research professor at Arizona State University’s Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy and associate professor of medical microbiology at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe.There isn’t enough data on herbs and COVID-19Historically, there’s been a major lack of evidence surrounding natural medicines.",the science is scarce,no

Drinking More Than Usual During the COVID-19 Pandemic? > News > Yale Medicine

Not being able to visit friends or enjoy many out-of-home activities leaves some people feeling like they don’t have much else to do, so why not enjoy a glass of wine—or two or three?Indeed, data from Nielsen indicates people are drinking more. For the week ending May 2, total alcohol sales in the U.S. were up by more than 32% compared to the same week one year ago. These figures have some medical experts worried.The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have issued communications warning people to avoid excessive drinking, saying it may increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Beyond that, alcohol consumption is already a major public health problem in the U.S., the NIAAA says.",increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity,neutral
Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.thecut.com/2020/07/drinking-coronavirus.html," Does drinking alcohol mean I’m more likely to get COVID-19?﻿We don’t know yet, but that’s not necessarily cause for celebration. “There is no direct research that I’m aware of in relation to alcohol and COVID-19,” says Gregory A. Poland, an expert in infectious diseases and professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic. “But the absence of research doesn’t mean the absence of harm.”
What experts do know is how alcohol overuse impacts the immune system more broadly, and from that, what might be reasonable to assume about alcohol overuse and the coronavirus — which, though new, is not entirely unlike other respiratory infections that have been well researched. How does alcohol impact the immune system?﻿Critically, there’s a difference between alcohol use and alcohol misuse — though the line between them can be somewhat nebulous. “There’s really good evidence that short-term alcohol misuse — binge drinking — can suppress optimal immune function, suppress the ability to defend against the respiratory infection in the short run,” says Kathy Jung, director of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism division of metabolism and health effects. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for a woman within a two hour period, and five or more drinks for men within a two hour period, says Jung.",We don’t know yet,neutral
Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827214/does-alcohol-kill-the-coronavirus/," However, the same does not hold true about drinking alcoholic beverages. The World Health Organization has been very clear in stating that consuming alcohol does not protect you from the coronavirus and can increase your risk of health problems if you consume it in excess. And, of course, it can be deadly to ingest alcohol-based sanitizers or any other alcohol not meant for human consumption, and these products should be kept away from children when not in use. Bottom Line  Though washing your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water should be your priority, hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be effective at cleaning your hands in a pinch or when you are on the go. Alcohol can also be used to disinfect household surfaces, specifically electronics and screens. Consuming alcohol will not reduce your risk of contracting illness, and excess drinking can put you at greater risk for health problems.",excess drinking can put you at greater risk for health problems,neutral

COVID-19 pandemic brings new concerns about excessive drinking

Unwinding with a glass of wine or a ""quarantini"" might seem like a good way to cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. But for some people, too much alcohol is making the ongoing health crisis worse. ""There are data to indicate people are drinking more than usual,"" said Dr. Mariann Piano, a substance abuse researcher. ""And there's no question that drinking too much every day leads to an increase in health risks.""",too much alcohol is making the ongoing health crisis worse,neutral
Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-alcohol-hurt-your-immune-system-during-covid-19-outbreak," Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Alcohol has been flying off the shelves as people try to combat boredom during lockdown, with some reports estimating that alcoholic beverage sales surged by 55 percent toward the end of March. The spike in alcohol sales has alarmed health experts and officials around the world, who are concerned that increased drinking could make people even more vulnerable to the respiratory disease.The U.S. surgeon general warned at-risk adults to refrain from drinking. Soon after, the World Health Organization (WHO) also suggested that people cut back on drinking, since alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19. “Alcohol consumption is associated with a range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and mental health disorders, which can make a person more vulnerable to COVID-19. In particular, alcohol compromises the body’s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes,” the WHO stated.Though there’s still limited data on the link between alcohol and COVID-19, past evidence shows alcohol consumption can worsen the outcomes from other respiratory illnesses by damaging the lungs and gut, and impairing the cells responsible for immune function.",alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19,yes

Comment:







The pandemic’s uncertainty and stress, combined with disrupted routines, may have encouraged some people to progress into heavier drinking habits, along with undercutting efforts to remain sober, though it’s still too soon for much peer-reviewed data, psychologists say. Potential stressors that can foster more reliance on alcohol are nearly ubiquitous these days—from financial insecurity to juggling work and childcare from home to protests and racial unrest. Alcohol misuse also boosts the chance of contracting the virus, as it can impair the body’s immune system, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and people with substance use disorders are both more likely to develop COVID-19 and experience worse COVID-19 outcomes (Wang, Q., et al, Molecular Psychiatry, 2020). There’s also the risk that people are more prone to let their guard down about distancing, hand-washing and other safety protocols while under the influence, psychologists say (see Drinking and pandemic safety during the pandemic).",people with substance use disorders,neutral
Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2021/03/alcohol-and-covid-19-what-we-know/," However, whether these mechanisms work against the Covid-19 virus in vivo in humans has not been studied/shown in appropriate studies. 3. DOES WINE CONSUMPTION MAKE COVID-19 VACCINATION INEFFECTIVE


There is very limited research on light or moderate consumption of wine/alcoholic beverages and immune response to vaccines. A small number of animal and human studies have examined the effect of alcohol consumption on the immune response following vaccination – however, no studies have been published so far on alcoholic beverages and response to a Covid-19 vaccine. Some indication exists that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may assist the immune response to the vaccine, potentially through an anti-inflammatory effect of the wine polyphenols, however, there is an insufficient amount of research to form a conclusion.

Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://americanaddictioncenters.org/blog/alcohol-and-covid-vaccine," The reasons are twofold. The hangover symptoms produced by heavy drinking exacerbate potential flu-like side effects from the vaccine. The other relates to the efficacy of the vaccine; it comes from a physician at Loyola University who specializes in immunology. This expert, who underscored the effects of alcohol on the immune system, recommends those who imbibe should refrain from excessive drinking “for at least a week before the first dose.” A medical specialist in the U.K. adds: “Long term heavy drinking reduces immune protection, and specifically for respiratory infections, which include Covid-19.” What does she advise for those in this category?

Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/can-you-drink-alcohol-after-covid-19-vaccine," A September 2015 review published in the journal Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry suggested that moderate drinking could improve your vaccination response, while chronic (long-term) heavy drinking could increase your risk for bacterial and viral infections. The review noted, however, that more studies were needed because results were overall mixed, and there are many factors that need to be taken into account regarding alcohol intake and its effects on the body. So while there was no evidence that drinking alcohol affects the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, and some doctors advised against drinking alcohol immediately after receiving the shot—especially heavy drinking—there wasn't official guidance on this. And while alcohol can have both relaxation and pain-relieving benefits, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) advised against using alcohol to achieve these purposes, partly because the dose necessary for pain relief is higher than what is recommended by the CDC Dietary Guidelines for Alcohol. Essentially, it's your call regarding a post-vaccination cocktail, but remember to also give your body time to recover. ""Focus on rest and hydration,"" Dr. Elliott advised.",no evidence that drinking alcohol affects the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine,neutral

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 

Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs.",Humidity,neutral

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral
Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-humidity-may-affect-covid-19-outcome," For instance, in tropical areas, airborne droplets that contain the virus fall on indoor surfaces, where the virus can survive for longer periods. “Many homes and buildings [in these areas] are poorly ventilated, and people often live in close proximity, and in these cases, the benefits of higher humidity are mitigated,” Prof. Iwasaki says.The researcher emphasizes that people can transmit the virus at any time of the year through contact with one another and contaminated surfaces. The new findings apply only to airborne transmission. “It doesn’t matter if you live in Singapore, India, or the Arctic, you still need to wash your hands and practice social distancing,” cautions Prof. Iwasaki.That said, the review concludes that studies in mice suggest that a relative humidity of 40–60% is ideal for containing the virus.“That’s why I recommend humidifiers during the winter in buildings,” says the study’s senior author.Other studies in mice also found that an environment of 50% relative humidity contributed to good viral clearance and an efficient immune response.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesCOVID-19Share this articleBy Ana Sandoiu on April 2, 2020 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, MPHLatest newsCould a drug for high blood pressure help slow aging?

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health/what-temperature-kills-coronavirus," Let’s take a closer look at some strategies that won’t help eliminate this virus. Exposing yourself to high temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19 by exposing yourself to high temperatures, such as:taking a hot bath or showersitting in a sauna or hot tubusing hot air from a hand dryer or hair dryerThese methods are unlikely to produce the temperatures needed to effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Instead of killing the virus, they can actually be harmful, especially at higher temperatures, and could potentially burn or scald your skin.Spending extended time in the sunYou may have heard that warm weather and UV light can kill germs, including viruses. However, soaking up the sun to prevent COVID-19 isn’t a good idea.The types of UV light in sunlight (UVA and UVB light) aren’t as effective at killing germs. Additionally, prolonged sun exposure can cause skin damage, sunburns, and possibly skin cancer.Wiping down household surfaces with hot waterThe water from your tap won’t be hot enough to kill the new coronavirus. However, using unheated soapy water will be enough to kill the virus.",temperaturesYou can’t prevent COVID-19,no
Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238339," Although higher humidity may increase the atmospheric suspended matter [22], the amount of virus deposited on surfaces, and virus survival time in droplets on surfaces [44], the reduction of the virus spread by indirect air transmission may be an important factor behind the reduced spreading of COVID-19 in a humid climate. High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39]. The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47]. Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48]. Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35]. Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection.",High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract,neutral

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32946453/," Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, two studies had a high risk of bias, eleven studies were scored as moderate risk of bias, and four studies were classified as low risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion:

Dorigatti said other studies by Mohammad M Sajadi and Yiqun Ma had found a role for humidity, with lower humidity associated with higher transmission rates, implying that humid heat may reduce transmission more than dry heat.Can we worry less about Covid in warmer weather?In short, no. Dr Will Pearse, another researcher on the Imperial study, said the critical message was that the weather was only a small factor in the spread of Covid.“I would really strongly encourage people to not think: ‘OK, it’s warm weather outside, so I don’t need to worry about Covid,’” he said. “We’ve seen what the situation looks like in places warmer than the UK and in places colder than the UK. Warm weather is no substitute for mitigation.”Kathleen O’Reilly, an epidemiologist with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: “Hopefully most people will be sensible and pragmatic; meeting outdoors will minimise Covid-19 infection risk but staying out of direct sunlight, especially at midday, is still important.",meeting outdoors will minimise Covid-19 infection risk,neutral

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200323-coronavirus-will-hot-weather-kill-covid-19," The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived. “Climate comes into play because it affects the stability of the virus outside the human body when expelled by coughing or sneezing, for example,” says Miguel Araújo, who studies the effects of environmental change on biodiversity at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, Spain. “The greater the time the virus remains stable in the environment, the greater its capacity to infect other people and become epidemic. While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”A recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hopeHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics. Araújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world. “It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says.",the shorter the virus survived,neutral
Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/researchers-propose-humidity-masks-may-lessen-severity-covid-19," “High levels of humidity have been shown to mitigate severity of the flu, and it may be applicable to severity of COVID-19 through a similar mechanism.”

Dr. Adriaan Bax sits in front of lab equipment.NIDDK

High levels of humidity can limit the spread of a virus to the lungs by promoting mucociliary clearance (MCC), a defense mechanism that removes mucus − and potentially harmful particles within the mucus − from the lungs. High levels of humidity can also bolster the immune system by producing special proteins, called interferons, that fight against viruses − a process known as the interferon response. Low levels of humidity have been shown to impair both MCC and the interferon response, which may be one reason why people are likelier to get respiratory infections in cold weather. The study tested four common types of masks: an N95 mask, a three-ply disposable surgical mask, a two-ply cotton-polyester mask, and a heavy cotton mask.

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/weather-doesnt-matter-covid-19-can-spread-in-warm-or-cold-temperatures," Cold weather. COVID-19 doesn’t care.Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin say the novel coronavirus spreads with about the same efficiency regardless of air temperature and humidity.“The effect of weather is low and other features such as mobility have more impact than weather,” said Dev Niyogi, PhD, a professor at UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences and Cockrell School of Engineering who led the research. “In terms of relative importance, weather is one of the last parameters.”In April 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a report suggesting that increased summer temperatures, humidity, and sunlight could present a barrier to COVID-19 transmission. “Maybe this goes away with heat and light. It seems like that’s the case,” President Donald Trump said at the time.The new research runs counter to that speculation.“Temperature and humidity is not much of a factor,” Niyogi told Healthline.Human behavior, researchers said, remains the biggest factor in the spread of COVID-19.Simply put, when it’s warm out, people spend more time outside, where disease transmission is limited.When it gets cold out, people spend more time indoors together, where COVID-19 transmission risk is higher.“It’s not what the temperature does, it’s what the temperature makes people do,” Dr. Aaron Glatt, chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in New York and the hospital’s lead epidemiologist and infectious diseases chief, told Healthline.“The critical factor is when people are in an indoor space that’s poorly ventilated, there’s going to be a higher risk of infection. That’s the case with any respiratory illness, not just COVID,” he said.Glatt noted that weather does sometimes play a role in illness prevalence.",Temperature and humidity is not much of a factor,no

Transcript








An adviser to the Department of Homeland Security gave a presentation during the White House COVID-19 briefing about ""emerging"" results that coronavirus could slow with direct sunlight and humidity. DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
 At a briefing last night at the White House, a scientist from the Department of Homeland Security unveiled some preliminary research suggesting that heat and humidity kill the coronavirus. From there, the briefing got a little strange, with President Trump suggesting that ultraviolet light or injected bleach may work as well. I want to bring in NPR's global health and development correspondent Jason Beaubien.","

Another study published March 1 in the Journal of Hospital Infection examined the lifespans of various human coronaviruses on many different surfaces. The study authors found that spikes in temperature made a difference in the lifespans of coronaviruses across surfaces. For example, an 18-degree Fahrenheit (32-degree Celsius) jump, from 68 degrees to 86 degrees, decreased how long SARS lasted on steel surfaces by at least half.This may be because some coronaviruses (and the flu) have a viral envelope: a layer of fat that protects viral particles when traveling from person to person in the air. But that sheath can dry out faster in warmer temperatures, disabling the virus.Increases in temperature and humidity correlate with number of new daily casesThe researchers also examined the average number of cases per day from February 8 through February 29 in countries with significant coronavirus outbreaks, like Italy, Australia, Thailand, and the US. Their research revealed that the average number of new daily cases during that time period in a place like Italy, where the temperature hovered around 48 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius), was four times the number of new cases in a place like Thailand, where temperatures were closer to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).The same was true for humidity: the greater the percentage of relative humidity is the fewer number of new cases.Basically, humidity is how much moisture is in the air, or how clammy your skin feels outside.",significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19,neutral

The lower humidity aids the spread of virus aerosols and could make the virus more stable.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Humidity and rainfallLaboratory and observational studies of cases of COVID-19 patients show an impact of humidity on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.A laboratory-generated aerosol of SARS-CoV-2 was stable at a relative humidity of 53% at room temperature, 23°C, 73°F. The virus had not degenerated much even after 16 hours and was more robust than MERS and SARS-CoV. This helps explain its higher levels of airborne infectivity.Laboratory studies do not necessarily predict how a virus will behave in the real world. However, a study of 17 cities in China with more than 50 cases of COVID-19 found a link between rises in humidity and reductions in COVID-19 cases.

WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients

20 November 2020
















WHO has updated its recommendation on remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.On 22 April 2022, following publication of new data from a clinical trial looking at the outcome of admission to hospital, WHO now suggests the use of remdesivir in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization. Latest information on COVID-19 therapeutics.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.This recommendation, released on 20 November, is part of a living guideline on clinical care for COVID-19. It was developed by an international guideline development group, which includes 28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners and one ethicist. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support. The guidelines are an innovation, matching scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic.",there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes,neutral

Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Remdesivir, a drug that once offered hope against Ebola, is now in the spotlight as the only current effective medication for COVID-19. But experts caution that it’s no “silver bullet” against the disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.The drug’s history, though, shows the long and arduous path that compounds take from initial development to reaching the marketplace — a journey that many of these potential drugs never finish.Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc. began research on remdesivir in 2009, as part of research programs for hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Later testing showed that the drug had broad-spectrum antiviral activity.This led to initial animal studies against the Ebola virus. The drug, though, failed to live up to expectations, coming up short against two other drugs in a landmark clinical trial published last year.Even before COVID-19, Gilead had tested remdesivir against other coronaviruses — including those that cause SARS and MERS — in laboratory and animal studies. However, no clinical trials were done because there were too few MERS cases and no SARS cases at the time.At the beginning of this year, when scientists determined that the new pneumonia-like illness in China was caused by a coronavirus, Gilead provided remdesivir to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to test the drug against the virus.Remdesivir is thought to interfere with the mechanism that certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, use to make copies of themselves.",it’s no “silver bullet,neutral

But a recent massive global study of remdesivir's effectiveness, run by the WHO, showed that remdesivir had little or no impact on hospitalized patients, contradicting previous trials.",little or no impact on hospitalized patients,no
Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2021/01/31/remdesivir-covid-coronavirus/," Based on interim results from studying more than 5000 participants, the international study concluded that remdesivir ""had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay."" As a consequence of being mostly ineffective, WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in Covid-19 patients. Remdesivir is an expensive drug
The drug is administered over 5 or 10 days. A five-day course of treatment costs around $2600 per person. So for a hospital with hundreds of Covid patients, that would amount to millions of dollars for one antiviral. That price could be cost-effective if remdesivir saved lives and its use was limited to moderate or severe disease, but it's also being made available for milder cases and WHO found that it isn't a lifesaving drug.",little or no effect,no

Martin Landray of the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the world's largest study of various COVID-19 treatments, says remdesivir ""definitely doesn't work in the sickest patients where the biggest gains would be"" but might help people at earlier stages of disease. Further complicating the matter, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 recover without any intervention. ""The argument that the earlier you use it the better is great until you realize what the implications of that are: You won't save many lives, and you'll have to treat a lot of patients,"" Landray says. ""It's very inconvenient, and it'll cost you a fortune."" Questions have also arisen about the potential of remdesivir to do harm.",might help people at earlier stages of disease,neutral

Can Remdesivir be used to treat COVID-19 (coronavirus)? Yes, remdesivir (Veklury, GS-5734) can be used to treat COVID-19, Veklury was the first FDA approved treatment for COVID-19 in the United States. Remdesivir (Veklury) has FDA approval for treatment for COVID-19 in patients who have had a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test:

who are 28 days of age and older, who weigh at least 3 kilograms (about 7 pounds) and are

The drug has been used in the US, China and Italy, but only on a ""compassionate basis"" -- essentially, the drug hasn't received approval but can be used outside of a clinical trial on critically ill patients. Remdesivir isn't specifically designed to destroy SARS-CoV-2. Instead, it works by knocking out a specific piece of machinery in the virus, known as ""RNA polymerase,"" which many viruses use to replicate. It has been shown in the past to be effective in human cells and mouse models. Its effectiveness is still being debated, and much more rigorous study will be needed before this becomes a general treatment for SARS-CoV-2, if it does at all.",There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet,no

Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 

In this recently published Cochrane review, authors explored the effects of treating COVID-19 with remdesivir, an antiviral medication. First author Kelly Ansems said ""Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening."" Key messages
For adults hospitalised with COVID-19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care. The review authors are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing.

The antiviral drug remdesivir has been approved for emergency use among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in recent studies, has shown promise as a treatment for the pandemic disease. How exactly does remdesivir counter SARS-CoV-2 -- the coronavirus strain responsible for COVID-19? With hat tips to virologist Jan Carette, PhD, geneticist Judith Frydman, PhD, and infectious-disease expert Bob Shafer, MD, let's follow the coronavirus downstream as it courses through its agenda within the infected cell.

What helps, what doesn't, and what's in the pipeline

Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19. Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19 in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness.

Now researchers have found that a natural compound found in this commonly used spice could help eliminate certain viruses.This compound in turmeric, called ""curcumin"", can prevent Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) -- an alpha-group coronavirus that infects pigs -- from infecting cells, said the study published in the Journal of General Virology.At higher doses, the compound was also found to kill virus particles.Infection with TGEV causes a disease called transmissible gastroenteritis in piglets, which is characterised by diarrhoea, severe dehydration and death.TGEV is highly infectious and is invariably fatal in piglets younger than two weeks, thus posing a major threat to the global swine industry.There are currently no approved treatments for alpha-coronaviruses and although there is a vaccine for TGEV, it is not effective in preventing the spread of the virus.To determine the potential antiviral properties of curcumin, the research team treated experimental cells with various concentrations of the compound, before attempting to infect them with TGEV.They found that higher concentrations of curcumin reduced the number of virus particles in the cell culture.The research suggests that curcumin affects TGEV in a number of ways: by directly killing the virus before it is able to infect the cell, by integrating with the viral envelope to 'inactivate' the virus, and by altering the metabolism of cells to prevent viral entry. ""Curcumin has a significant inhibitory effect on TGEV adsorption step and a certain direct inactivation effect, suggesting that curcumin has great potential in the prevention of TGEV infection,"" said Lilan Xie, lead author of the study and researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering in China.Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the replication of some types of virus, including dengue virus, hepatitis B and Zika virus.The compound has also been found to have a number of significant biological effects, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities.Curcumin was chosen for this research due to having low side effects according to Xie.The researchers now hope to continue their research in vivo, using an animal model to assess whether the inhibiting properties of curcumin would be seen in a more complex system. ""Further studies will be required to evaluate the inhibitory effect in vivo and explore the potential mechanisms of curcumin against TGEV, which will lay a foundation for the comprehensive understanding of the antiviral mechanisms and application of curcumin,"" said Xie.End of the articleVisual StoriesRight arrowEntertainmentPics: Aishwarya Lekshmi looks ravishingRecipesHow to make Paneer Tikka at homeEntertainmentTen adorable pictures of Akshara GowdaLife StyleCelebs sizzle on the red carpetEntertainmentTen appealing pictures of Divyansha KaushikTV​Cook with Comali fame Dharsha Gupta's bikini pics​TVTimes when Mansi-Inchara Joshi set major sibling goalsTVBest dressed TV celebs of the weekTVSTI2: The educational qualifications of SharksLife StyleFlowers to grow in the garden this seasonSponsored StoriesHigh Import Tariff Adding Fillip to Illicit Gold TradeJordan Yeoh's Fitness

This in turn can limit the risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its serious health complications.Eating a plant-based diet may also help prevent the development of chronic health conditions that might cause complications or increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.A vegan diet may also help people reach a moderate weight and prevent obesity, reducing the risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes.It is worth noting that not all vegan foods are healthy, and people should avoid processed vegan foods and choose a whole foods diet instead.People following a strict vegan diet should also ensure that they supplement essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

Can a vegetarian diet prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-to-eat-with-covid," The virus’s full name is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and the illness it causes is called COVID-19 (4).COVID-19 negatively affects nutritional status because it decreases appetite and may limit your access to nutritious foods during confinement, yet it simultaneously increases your body’s need for nutrients, such as vitamin D (3, 5, 6).Diet and nutrition can help support your immune health if you have COVID-19, especially if you consume foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (1, 2, 5, 6, 7).It’s important to note that this is an emerging area of research. These foods won’t prevent you from contracting the novel coronavirus or cure the disease, but they have been shown to support immune health.This article lists key nutrients, foods, and nutrition practices that may be beneficial for people who have COVID-19 or are recovering from it.Share on PinterestDavide Illini/Stocksy United1. Vitamin DVitamin D is the most frequently discussed micronutrient among nutrition experts for the management of COVID-19 (5).This fat-soluble vitamin and hormone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing overactivity of the immune system, according to newer and older research (1, 5, 8, 9).In the body, vitamin D acts on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein receptor found in the lungs and fat tissue (1, 7).The novel coronavirus binds to ACE2 at the beginning of an infection, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe illness in people with COVID-19 (10).However, vitamin D interacts with the ACE2 receptors, potentially preventing the virus from binding to them, and reducing complications associated with COVID-19 (1, 10, 11).Vitamin D may also play a protective role and support healing of damaged tissues, primarily in the lungs (10).Foods to eatOn average, people make approximately 80% of their vitamin D when their skin is exposed to sunlight (ultraviolet light) and get the remaining 20% from their diet (8).As a result, taking vitamin D daily may be a good idea if you’re in confinement due to COVID-19 and have little sunlight exposure (5).However, some medications may interact with vitamin D supplements — including blood thinners, which are common among people with COVID-19 as a result of the increased risk of blood clotting.That’s why it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before you start taking vitamin D supplements regularly.Increasing your intake of vitamin D-rich foods while you have or are recovering from COVID-19 is a great way to reduce the risk of a vitamin D deficiency and potentially improve your immune response.Here are seven foods rich in vitamin D, along with the amount of the vitamin each contains (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18):Cod liver oil: 170% of the Daily Value (DV) per 1 tablespoon (13.6 grams)Herring: 27% of the DV per 100 gramsEgg yolk: 27% of the DV per 100 gramsSardine: 24% of the DV per 100 gramsCanned light tuna: 34% of the DV per 100 gramsSalmon, wild-caught or farmed: 66% of the DV per 100 gramsFortified orange juice: 25% of the DV per 100 gramsWild mushrooms are a vegetarian source of vitamin D. Their levels vary depending on the type of light they were exposed to as they were growing, according to older research (19).SummaryVitamin D may help protect your lungs during novel coronavirus infection by disrupting viral attachment in your body. Several foods are rich in vitamin D, including cod liver oil, salmon, herring, and some wild mushrooms.2. Carotenoids and vitamin ACarotenoids are antioxidants as well as pigments (red, green, yellow, and orange). They’re found in nature in some colorful algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, fruits, and vegetables, some of which you can include in your diet (20, 21).Of the 700 carotenoids identified in nature, only about 30 have been found in the human body.",Diet and nutrition can help support your immune health,neutral

Can the flu shot do that?Yes and no, doctors say.The flu vaccine does not prevent COVID-19. But it’s still a good idea, because a healthy body has an easier time fighting off a COVID-19 infection. A new study suggests that getting a flu shot may make COVID-19 less lethal.If you get sick with the flu, and then contract COVID-19 at the same time or soon afterward, it could lead to a serious illness because your body would be weakened from influenza, said Dr. David Margolius, an internal medicine doctor at MetroHealth System.“That would be a dangerous situation,” Margolius said.The influenza virus and coronaviruses both cause respiratory illness, but they are different genetically. The flu vaccine triggers the production of antibodies that fight the influenza virus specifically. “It doesn’t cross-react and fight coronavirus,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, co-director of infection control at University Hospitals.A study of data from more than 90,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil found that the flu vaccine was associated with lower mortality among COVID-19 patients in Brazil.",The flu vaccine does not prevent COVID-19,no

It causes vasodilation, excretion of sodium, retention of potassium, and a decrease in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which are popular medications used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease, can raise ACE-2 levels.There was a concern that more surface receptors in the lung would allow more of COVID-19 to enter cells or make the effect of the virus much worse. There is no proof of this, but it does make some sense.An editorial in The Lancet early in the COVID-19 pandemic stated that physicians should stop the medications that work on the renin-angiotensin system.2A media firestorm erupted, leading to the publication of a paper endorsed by all the leading cardiology journals in the United States and Europe to refute the editorial, urging physicians and patients not to stop their medications.3 Since then, potential therapies have been developed to either prevent the virus from attaching to the ACE-2 receptor, decreasing the amount of ACE-2 or increasing the level of ACE-2.In one scenario, flooding the body with circulating ACE-2 might fool the virus into attaching to the circulating ACE-2 and not bind to surface receptors. In another scenario, decreasing ACE-2 levels would prevent the virus from entering a large number of cells, allowing natural immunity to kill the virus.Since these receptors have multiple other functions, particularly in cardiovascular regulation, it is unclear to me whether they could cause more harm than good.

Not Enough Evidence
Anxiety over the link between COVID-19 and ACE inhibitors/ARBs stems from the known interplay between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. “ACE2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral entry for SARS-CoV-2 with increasing evidence that it has a protracted role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,” Patel and Verma write. It’s possible that ACE inhibitors could directly inhibit ACE2, but “ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase and is not inhibited by clinically prescribed ACE inhibitors,” they say in their JAMA paper. “In addition, there is concern that the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs will increase expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation.”

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are safe to use
Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, our Medical Director, said:
“The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been a hot topic of debate since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. This left millions of people living with heart and circulatory conditions questioning whether they should continue to take their heart medications. “This UK study, which is the first to include significant proportions of people from both white and minority ethnic backgrounds, adds to other recent evidence confirming these medications do not increase the risk of severe Covid-19 infections. These drugs are very effective for heart failure, and to control high blood pressure to help prevent a heart attack or stroke. This study provides further reassurance that their use is safe and that it is important that patients continue to take them as prescribed to protect cardiovascular health.""",these medications do not increase the risk of severe Covid-19 infections,no

The first meta-analysis investigated the rate of COVID-19 positive cases, whereas the second meta-analysis determined the mortality rate among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.The results of the meta-analyses demonstrated that patients taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not have an increased rate of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs were not shown to have an increased mortality rate.The researchers also conducted a sub-analysis that focused on the data from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were treated for hypertension. Among these patients, taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs was associated with a lower mortality rate. ""Our study results confirm that patients already taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not discontinue taking them due to COVID-19 infection,"" said lead study author Yujiro Yokoyama, MD, a surgeon at St. Luke's University Health Network's Easton Hospital, in a press release.

This is according to research results published in JAMA Network Open. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous observational studies have evaluated the relationship between ACEI and ARB therapy and COVID-19 outcomes, due to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a binding site where viruses can gain cellular entry. Patients taking these medications, then, may experience exacerbated COVID-19 and worse outcomes. To further the clinical understanding of the relationship between clinical COVID-19 outcomes and the use of ACEIs and ARBs, researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature through September 2020. A total of 1788 studies were identified, of which 52 met inclusion criteria (participant N=101,949).","Patients taking these medications, then, may experience exacerbated COVID-19",neutral

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/ace-inhibitors-arbs-and-covid-19-what-gps-need-to," A brief summary of salient points:

The COVID-19 virus enters cells via ACE-2 receptors on cells
Some doctors are now questioning the use of antihypertensives ACE-inhibitors and ARBs due to their effect on ACE-2, and thus potential effect on COVID-19
Leading experts warn that ARBs may amplify COVID-19 severity in patients
The role of ACE-inhibitors on COVID-19 is less clear
Experts warn that abruptly stopping ARBs (and ACE-inhibitors) for heart failure may lead to acute heart failure, and ceasing them for ACE-inhibitors may lead to unstable blood pressure
Peak international cardiology bodies strongly recommend patients stay on current antihypertensive therapies

Why are antihypertensives currently a concern for COVID-19? The issue surrounding ACE-inhibitors and ARBs stems from the fact the COVID-19 virus binds to the ACE-2 receptor, according to Associate Professor Nathan Better, cardiologist and deputy director of nuclear medicine at Royal Melbourne Hospital and private cardiologist at Cabrini Hospital. ‘[COVID-19] attaches to the cell’s surface via the ACE-2 protein –  that is its sole point of entry – and what we know is that ARBs … increase the expression of the ACE-2 protein in the body as many as three to five times,’ Associate Professor Better told newsGP. ‘It basically works to give the virus a portal to entry; that’s what is being quoted [in the research].’
 
According to Associate Professor Better, treatment with ARBs then ‘amplifies’ the effects of COVID-19. From a ‘basic science point of view’, he said, it seems patients on these antihypertensives may fare worse than average, and that they should cease these medications. ‘But this has not been shown in any clinical trials,’ Associate Professor Better said, keen to note he is not advising that patients cease their medications based on that.",amplify COVID-19 severity,neutral

Writing in the June 2nd British Medical Journal, investigative reporters Stéphane Horel and Ties Keyzer discounted this possibility, alleging that the authors of some of the relevant research were in the pocket of Big Tobacco and their studies have been discredited:
In the early days of the pandemic, media outlets around the world reported that smokers seemed to be under-represented among patients seriously ill with covid-19 in China and France. The headlines asked, does nicotine protect against covid-19? … It has since been roundly disproved that smoking protects against covid-19 … the BMJ can today also report on undisclosed financial links between certain scientific authors and the tobacco and e-cigarette industry in a number of covid research papers.

What’s more, we know that the benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh any theoretical protective effects of starting or continuing to smoke against coronavirus infection. Among them: improved immunity, lowered cancer risk, improved circulation and blood pressure, clearer skin, lower cholesterol, and better control over blood sugar and insulin. Simply put, even if there is a curious crop of data suggesting smokers aren’t being admitted to hospitals, seeking treatment, or testing positive for COVID-19 as frequently as non-smokers, these findings by no means confirm that smoking protects against coronavirus infection, nor should they be considered as a means to justify continued smoking or take it up. The data could be erroneous (false positives are a hallmark of new research, which is why replication is required before scientists conclude that their hypotheses are correct).

Are smokers more or less likely to catch Covid-19? We don’t know for sure whether or not smokers are more likely to catch coronavirus, although we do know they are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. On the one hand, some early articles suggested that smoking could increase your chances of being infected, as smokers tend to touch their face and mouth more often. On the other hand, a recent evidence review by London researchers suggests people who currently smoke may be less likely to be infected with coronavirus. One study suggests this could be because nicotine interferes with ACE2 receptors, which may prevent the virus from entering cells.

Summary of the current knowledge on smoking and COVID-19. Recent available data indicate that individuals with a smoking history are more likely to acquire more severe COVID-19 outcomes, including intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality, than non-smokers. Moreover, research findings also indicate that smokers exhibit increased expression ACE-II receptors, which acts as a binding site for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence, therapeutic agents targeting SARS-CoV-2/ACE-II interaction may offer a path for the development of COVID-19 treatments. See this image and copyright information in PMC

FAQs About Smoking and COVID-19
Does smoking increase my risk of getting COVID-19 and make the symptoms of COVID-19 worse? At this time, we don’t know if smoking will increase your chance of getting COVID-19. We do know that smoking damages your lungs and that COVID-19 causes mild to severe breathing problems. This means that if you keep smoking and you become sick with COVID-19, you’re more likely to have worse symptoms than someone who doesn’t smoke and gets COVID-19. You’re also more likely to:

Need to go to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)


Need to be hooked up to a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe

Some cannabis compounds can prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from entering human cells — but smoking marijuana offers no protection against the illness, according to a study by Oregon State University. The researchers found that a pair of hemp compounds — cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, CBDA — bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking a vital step in the deadly bug’s path to infect people. “These cannabinoid acids are abundant in hemp and in many hemp extracts,” said lead researcher Richard van Breemen at Oregon State’s Global Hemp Innovation Center in the College of Pharmacy and Linus Pauling Institute, KTVZ reported. “They are not controlled substances like THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and have a good safety profile in humans,” he said.",smoking marijuana offers no protection,no

If anything, information like this only encourages misguided people to start or continue smoking, or even quit smoking treatment, by emphasizing that nicotine can prevent acute lung damage caused by Covid-19 pneumonia and prevents the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immune system.How did the notion come across?According to certain researchers, the intake of nicotine causes lung contraction, where there is a decrease in mucus production. This causes a suppression of the allergic responses when the body comes across an infection-causing agent or an allergic substance, as there is a reduction in inflammatory cytokines in the immune system. This led the researchers to conclude that nicotine can decrease the risk of having serious symptoms due to Covid-19. According to them, a defined pharmaceutical amount of nicotine can be used as a therapy for Covid-19.

Key Takeaways

Type O blood may have a protective effect against COVID-19.Most data shows there's no difference in COVID-19 susceptibility among people with A, AB, and B blood types. Ongoing research indicates that people with type O blood seem to have a slightly lower risk of contracting COVID-19. While it’s too soon to know why type O blood offers a protective effect against the disease, several studies suggest there is a correlation. One of the largest data sets on the topic comes from the genetic testing company 23andMe, which has surveyed over a million people since April. The company’s survey data shows that people with type O blood are 9% to 18% less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than people with other blood types. “We think this finding is going to be really essential to the scientific community to understand the biological mechanism behind COVID-19 susceptibility: Why do some people get impacted and not others?” Anjali Shastri, PhD, Senior Research Program Manager at 23andMe, tells Verywell.",Type O blood may have a protective effect,neutral
Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a34394784/blood-type-coronavirus-covid-19/," In 2020, scientists started talking about a link between blood type and Covid. That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility. Yet no research so far has been able to pin down the molecular goings on that explain the mechanism behind why this might be so.",people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid,neutral

                        January 13, 2021                    











Patients with type O and rhesus negative (Rh-) blood groups may have a lower risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Investigators conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 225,556 patients who had their ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019, and subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 15 and June 30, 2020.

People with the O blood type (whether O positive or O negative) had a lower incidence of COVID-19 positive tests. The reduction in risk appeared to be about 9 to 18 percent for people with an O blood type compared with other blood types, among which there was little difference in susceptibility. This difference in risk of testing positive for COVID-19 seemed to hold even when researchers took into account age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, and co-morbidities (i.e., pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes). After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, and high-risk co-morbidity or being immunocompromised, those with blood type O were, on average, 14-percent less likely to acquire a COVID-19 infection and 19-percent less likely to be hospitalized for the infection. In populations at high-risk for exposure, such as healthcare workers, essential workers, and people exposed to a known case of the disease, the O blood type had an even greater protective effect, reducing the risk of acquiring the virus by 19 percent.

Your Blood Type May Affect COVID-19 Risk, But It's No Kind of Protection, Experts Say

Health16 July 2020By AYLIN WOODWARD, Business Insider

A handful of early studies have found that people with blood type O may have a slight advantage during this pandemic.Research published over the weekend found that patients with type O were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than patients with type A, B, or AB blood. An April study found a similar trend: The research (though yet to be peer-reviewed) analysed 1,559 coronavirus patients in New York City and found that a lower proportion had type O blood.Other research has reported a link between patients' blood type and the severity of their infections, but these two studies did not. Overall, the jury is still out on whether your blood type affects your coronavirus risk in any significant way. ""No one should think they're protected,"" Nicholas Tatonetti, the lead author of the April study, told the New York Times.Blood type O is associated 'with a lower risk of testing positive'The newest study on blood types examined nearly 1,300 coronavirus patients admitted to five hospitals in Massachusetts in March and April.The results showed that blood type O ""was associated with a lower risk of testing positive,"" the researchers said, while types B and AB came with a higher risk. Type A blood had no link to a patient's chance of a positive diagnosis. The research aligns with previous findings.In March, a study of 2,173 coronavirus patients at three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China, also found that people with blood type O had a lower risk of infection.A study published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine found an even more substantive link: Patients in Italy and Spain with blood type O had a 50 percent reduced risk of severe infection (cases requiring ventilation or supplemental oxygen) compared to patients with other blood types.More specifically, the study authors found that a region of the participants' genomes that helps code for blood type was linked to a patient's chances of developing severe symptoms.Research is split on whether any blood types are associated with higher riskO is the most common blood type.","

Early CDC research shows that people who got the booster were 84% less likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19. The data collected on the booster’s ability to curb infection is early and limited; some clinical trials have shown that bivalent shots are no more equipped to prevent people from contracting COVID-19 than the original vaccines.

TEHRAN, IRAN -- 
	Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened.

Subsequent research has shown the biggest risk of Covid-19 transmission is through particles in the air.Why did we focus on handwashing?When little was known about Covid-19, researchers focused on fomites – surfaces such as handrails where the virus might be able to survive without a host for some time – because other diseases such as norovirus can be transmitted that way. How does Covid-19 spread?Surface transmission may happen, but speaking and coughing seem to play a much larger role, because we emit tiny aerosol water particles containing the virus. Indoors, those particles can linger for minutes or hours, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest last week that people wear two masks. It now says surface transmission is “not thought to be a common way that Covid-19 spreads”.Can handwashing prevent the spread of Covid-19?Although there is limited evidence that fomites do play a role, there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces.

How well do face masks protect against COVID-19?Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly.By Mayo Clinic Staff


Can face masks help slow the spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Yes. Face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as getting vaccinated, frequent hand-washing and physical distancing, can help slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends masks for the general public. If you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital and new COVID-19 cases, the CDC recommends wearing a well-fitted mask indoors in public, whether or not you're vaccinated.

According to a study published in the Chinese Medical Journal, they usually contract more severe and protracted forms of the disease it causes, COVID-19, than non-smokers and die more often as a result. However, French researchers led by Jean-Pierre Changeux, a neurobiologist at the Institut Pasteur, suspect that nicotine patches could help prevent infections with the dangerous virus. They have published a corresponding hypothesis on the science portal Qeios.

However, the epidemic is progressing throughout French territory and new variants (in particular the ""English B1. 1.7 variant of SARS-COV-2"") much more contagious run a risk of accelerating the epidemic in the population. The anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccines recently launched (or being evaluated) represent great hope in this health crisis, but trials were only able to show their effectiveness on symptomatic forms of SARS-COV-2 infection.

We searched the literature for studies relating to COVID-19 and nicotine. Some are underway, and this piece will be updated as new findings emerge. In the meantime, the available research literature is mainly in the form of speculative commentaries, with some lab studies also reported.

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32790936/," In this regard, the ill effects of smoking are amply documented, and no doubt can be a confounding factor in COVID-19 progression. Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.

More specifically, based on the early observations where smoking prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was lower than expected, certain studies suggested a role for nAChRs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 through a direct interaction between these receptors and the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein). This suggestion was primarily based on the fact that the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 harbors a sequence motif related to known nAChR antagonists and may interact with nAChRs. Consequently, such interactions may be then involved in pathology and infectivity, which is a notion known as 'nicotinic hypothesis.' Furthermore, it was also proposed that COVID-19 might be controlled or alleviated by the use of nicotine if this compound can sterically or allosterically compete with the virus for binding to nAChRs. In this novel study, the researchers used molecular simulation to examine the nicotinic hypothesis – primarily by appraising whether the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein can stably bind to nAChRs via the Y674-R685 region (i.e., a viral portion with the highest affinity to these receptors).",nicotine might provide some protection in mitigating COVID-19,yes

Nicotine may potentially offer some protection against initial coronavirus infection by modulating the expression of the ACE2 enzyme and receptor, which coronaviruses hijack to enter and infect cells—that is, if Miraya et al.’s theory is correct (further proof is needed). But other data suggest that smokers who do end up getting infected by the novel coronavirus may be more likely to have worse outcomes than non-smokers. Consider a recent systematic review by epidemiologists Constantine Vardavas and Katerina Nikitara that found “higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases.” According to their analysis of five studies examining symptom severity and smoking status, current and former smokers were also “1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers.”
Miraya et al. argue that the worsening of smokers’ COVID19 symptoms upon hospital admissions found by other studies may have more to do with the “rebound effect” of ACE2 receptor expression that occurs when smokers are admitted to hospitals and are required to cease smoking. But the fact that former smokers also have poorer outcomes post-hospitalization would seem to dispute this.",Nicotine may potentially offer some protection against initial coronavirus infection,yes

This is an important area of study right now, because scientists have found that in many of the most severe cases of COVID-19, there seems to be an over-production of these cytokines, also known as “cytokine storm,” which prompts the body to attack its own cells and tissues instead of fighting the virus. It’s really important to know, however, that the immune system is made up of a variety of cells and chemical signalers that interact through a complex interplay, so it’s hard to say where cannabis may help tamp down the immune system and where it may hurt by increasing the risk of infection.",tamp down the immune system,no

Some cannabis compounds can prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from entering human cells — but smoking marijuana offers no protection against the illness, according to a study by Oregon State University. The researchers found that a pair of hemp compounds — cannabigerolic acid, or CBGA, and cannabidiolic acid, CBDA — bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking a vital step in the deadly bug’s path to infect people. “These cannabinoid acids are abundant in hemp and in many hemp extracts,” said lead researcher Richard van Breemen at Oregon State’s Global Hemp Innovation Center in the College of Pharmacy and Linus Pauling Institute, KTVZ reported. “They are not controlled substances like THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and have a good safety profile in humans,” he said.",prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from entering human cells,neutral

In November 2020, Erica Wilkins contracted COVID-19, underwent painful symptoms and discovered that the consumption of cannabis helped her symptoms subside and her body heal. Wilkins, the assistant manager at Bellingham’s Western Bud Cannabis Co., said hybrid edibles, which contain both CBD and THC, made a great impact on her recovery when she was ill. 
CBD, or Cannabidiol, is a compound found in the resinous flower of cannabis, and can be used for chronic pain, depression and anxiety according to Project CBD. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, on the other hand, is cannabis that can make one “high”, or intoxicated according to Project CBD.",Health & Wellness,neutral

While negative side effects are minimal with CBD, the article’s authors point out that CBD may have a side benefit for patients with the disease - reduced anxiety. “The many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as status of the economy, employment and loss of connection can fuel depression, fear and anxiety” they explain, pointing out that the increased inflammation in COVID-19 may also trigger increased levels of anxiety. But CBD has shown serious promise for the management of anxiety, and may help reduce these challenging levels of stress. No peer reviewed studies to date show that cannabis or its compounds can help with COVID-19 specifically, but the authors of this article say the evidence suggesting that it may help is worth further investigation. They recommend that scientists begin studies to investigate whether CBD can be used to reduce inflammation and anxiety in COVID-19 cases, as an adjunct to antiviral medications. While this doesn’t suggest cannabis should be considered a cure or treatment of COVID-19 on its own, it does suggest that it may have potential to help bring down inflammation and reduce anxiety in those suffering from the disease.",No peer reviewed studies to date show that cannabis or its compounds can help,no
Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.metrotimes.com/weed/new-study-finds-cannabis-could-reduce-chances-of-covid-19-infection-24568851," The result? Well, according to biological scientist and the study's lead researcher, Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, some strains reduced virus receptors by 73% — in turn, dramatically lowering the chance of getting the virus at all. This isn't the only study connecting cannabis and COVID-19. In Israel, medical researchers are also looking into cannabis' anti-inflammatory properties, but for treatment of coronavirus patients, rather than prevention, High Times reports. The study will likely start clinical trials in the coming months by using inflammatory cell samples from COVID-19 patients. The scientists' hope is to decode cannabinoids' response when interacting with the virus — specifically, when crossing paths with a “cytokine storm,” which happens when cytokine (an immune system protein) begins attacking the body's cells rather than the virus.",anti-inflammatory properties,neutral
Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://nypost.com/2020/05/21/scientists-believe-cannabis-could-help-prevent-treat-coronavirus/," “We were totally stunned at first, and then we were really happy,” one of the researchers, Olga Kovalchuk, told CTV News. The results, printed in online journal Preprints, indicated hemp extracts high in CBD may help block proteins that provide a “gateway” for COVID-19 to enter host cells. Shutterstock
Kovalchuk’s husband, Igor, suggested cannabis could reduce the virus’ entry points by up to 70 percent. “Therefore, you have more chance to fight it,” he told CTV. “Our work could have a huge influence — there aren’t many drugs that have the potential of reducing infection by 70 to 80 percent,” he told the Calgary Herald. While they stressed that more research was needed, the study gave hope that the cannabis, if proven to modulate the enzyme, “may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility” as well as “become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.”
Cannabis could even be used to “develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products,” the study suggested, with a “potential to decrease viral entry” through the mouth.",if proven to modulate the enzyme,neutral
Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/covid-cannabis-study-5216106," A recent study found that certain molecules in cannabis protect against COVID-19. And some corners of the internet are celebrating. Some late-night hosts are, too. But the data is not so clear-cut. Although medical cannabis can offer users relief, there is no evidence to suggest that smoking weed protects people from COVID-19 infection. Rather, two compounds not usually found in cannabis products humans use—cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)—were the stars of this research.",Although medical cannabis can offer users relief,neutral
Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.laweekly.com/how-cbd-and-thc-are-changing-covid-19-treatment/," CBD could be an effective treatment against cytokine storms, which is what causes the most havoc in the body. According to the medical journal, HealthEuropa, “Early findings in a study currently being conducted by terpene manufacturer Eybna and cannabis research and development firm CannaSoul Analytics, both from Israel, appear to indicate that the combination of terpenes and cannabinoids used is up to two times more effective than the corticosteroid dexamethasone when used to reduce inflammation from COVID-19. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.”
More research is continuing to happen overseas to see the virus’s full effects and ways CBD can mitigate long-term damage. Research from Rabin Medical Center at Beilinson, a leading hospital of Clalit HMO, holds a clue to further studies. In recent research, the Center’s team found that out of 11 patients in the program, 8 saw an improvement in infections stemming from the virus. Announced in January 2021, a clinical trial in Israel featuring Stero Biotechs, “aimed to benefit and help COVID-19 patients in severe states with respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).” With heart damage being a leading cause of complications from COVID-19, many are looking into ways to lessen the virus’s effects on the body after infection.",CBD could be an effective treatment against cytokine storms,yes

Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-food/202106/cannabis-may-treat-some-symptoms-in-covid-long-haulers," Two different molecules found in the cannabis plant, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabivarin (CVN), were investigated for potential use in long-hauler COVID patients. Using a series of sophisticated molecular docking and simulation studies, scientists discovered that CBD and CVN can effectively bind to these proteins and downregulate them. Taken together, these studies suggest that some components of the cannabis plant might be beneficial as a post-covid treatment strategy. Obviously, much more research is required in order to prove the effectiveness of these cannabinoids. References

Findings of the study led by van Breemen were published in the Journal of Natural Products. “As a complement to vaccines, small-molecule therapeutic agents are needed to treat or prevent infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, which cause COVID-19,” the paper reads. “Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2,” the research states. Van Breemen said resistant variants could still pop up amid widespread use of cannabinoids, but that the combination of vaccination and CBDA/CBGA treatment should make for a much more challenging environment for the virus.

Can Cannabis help COVID-19?,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/health/smoking-weed-coronavirus-wellness/index.html," Smoking marijuana, even occasionally, can increase your risk for more severe complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Coronavirus symptoms: 10 key indicators and what to do




      “What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. “Now you have some airway inflammation and you get an infection on top of it. So, yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”
  

      Hey wait, you might say, I’ve only just started and I’m not smoking much – so what’s the harm? The problem, said Dr. Mitchell Glass, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the American Lung Association, is that the last thing you want during a pandemic is to make it more difficult for a doctor to diagnose your symptoms. “Covid-19 is a pulmonary disease,” Glass said.","Smoking marijuana, even occasionally, can increase your risk for more severe complications",no

Now some early studies show that CBD could help block infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. What did the researchers do? In a series of studies supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, researchers tested the effects of CBD and other cannabis compounds on SARS-CoV-2. They looked at interactions between CBD and the virus in human lung cells and in mice.

Thank you for not smoking
All the epidemiologists Fortune spoke with note that recreational cannabis in any form does not help in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. “During the COVID pandemic, you should absolutely not smoke, because that is the one thing you can do to make your lung function worse,” Sodergren notes. “We don’t treat patients for COVID with medical cannabis precisely for the fact that we don’t have any, any clinical evidence to suggest that it is beneficial.”
Robin Duncan, lead author of the University of Waterloo study that found CBD increases the innate antiviral system in cells, explicitly states recreational marijuana in either THC or CBD form do not help immunity against COVID. “I really urge people not to go out and start taking CBD gummies or oils,” he says.",does not help in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19,neutral

KEY POINTSA study found that two acids in cannabis bond with the protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to infect peopleSmoking marijuana would not work against the virus because the process would destroy the acidsWhile not recommended for the seriously ill, cannabis-based dietary supplements may ""help keep people healthy""Smoking marijuana will not provide protection against COVID-19 even though the plant contains acids that behave similarly to the vaccines developed to fight the virus, experts said.Researchers with the Global Hemp Innovation Center at Oregon State University said that a pair of acids found in cannabis — cannabigerolic acid, or CBG-A, and cannabidiolic acid, CBD-A — bond with the ""spike protein"" that the coronavirus uses to infect people, newspaper the Asbury Park Press reported.The protein is the same one targeted by COVID-19 vaccines and other therapies used to prevent serious illness from the virus, noted the outlet. ""The acids from hemp, could be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and also to shorten infections by preventing virus particles from infecting human cells,"" Dr. Richard van Breemen, the lead researcher of the study published in January, explained.However, smoking weed will not provide protection against COVID-19 as it would result in the CBG-A and CBD-A acids being destroyed, according to Dr. David Nathan, a psychiatrist with Princeton University. ""[I]f you smoke it, if you vape it, if you bake it into something, those compounds are actually gone,"" Nathan, who is also the founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, an advocacy group of medical professionals calling for the end of cannabis prohibition, said.Additionally, the study led by Breemen only tested on human cells in a laboratory and not real humans, unlike the COVID-19 vaccines.Many pharmaceutical treatments are reportedly proven ineffective when they transitioned from laboratory testing to human testing.

However, the NIH halted the trial after the initial data suggested that the drug was no more effective than a placebo.What is the consensus?Overall, the findings from the above studies suggest that there is limited evidence for the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. A meta-analysis of 23 studies investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 supports this view.The meta-analysis concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of the drug is both weak and conflicting.Potential risks and safety concernsTwo potential safety concerns about the use of hydroxychloroquine are heart health issues and interactions with other drugs.Heart health issuesIn some studies, people taking hydroxychloroquine have experienced a side effect known as QT prolongation. This is where the heart takes longer than usual to recharge between beats.QT prolongation may increase the possibility of irregular heartbeat, known as arrhythmia.

Taken as a whole, the literature does not support utilizing hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is, at least in part, due to the wide variability in hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics between patients and difficulty achieving adequate target tissue concentrations of hydroxychloroquine without encountering unacceptable toxicities. Hydroxychloroquine continues to be a routinely prescribed, well-tolerated, effective, and low-cost treatment for rheumatic disease. Its therapeutic versatility has led to frequent repurposing for other conditions, most recently as an investigative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

There was plenty of hype about the drug during the early months of the pandemic. On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), allowing doctors to use HCQ and chloroquine (CQ) products in situations where clinical trials were not an option.Last month, the FDA withdrew the EUA. The agency explains that it “has determined that CQ and HCQ are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.”Clinical trials using the drug have shown mixed results and been marred with controversy. After an investigation by The Guardian into the quality of data analysis provided by a company called Surgisphere, the authors of one high-profile study in The Lancet retracted the paper.Several institutions have since halted their HCQ studies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Now, a new study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases — by researchers from the Henry Ford Health System, in Michigan — reports that treatment with HCQ alone and in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin reduced the number of deaths among people in the hospital with severe COVID-19.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Comparing mortality ratesThe corresponding author is Dr. Marcus J.

Another study published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed it provided no benefits to Covid-19 patients.Even before these reports were published, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about using the drugs in coronavirus patients outside of clinical trials, and the National Institutes of Health Covid-19 treatment guidelines warned against using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together.",there may likely be harm,neutral
Can Hydroxychloroquine worsen COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/hydroxychloroquine-doesnt-benefit-hospitalized-covid-19-patients," In March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization allowing doctors to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine. The drugs became part of routine care for COVID-19 patients at many hospitals. Larger, well-designed studies were needed to determine if hydroxychloroquine was a safe and effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In April, NIH launched a clinical trial at 34 hospitals nationwide to test the medication. The study was funded by NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

Can Hydroxychloroquine worsen COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.597985/full," Initially, some promising results for the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating COVID-19 patients were reported by a few in vitro and in vivo studies. However, current evidence is not yet sufficiently solid to warrant its use as a therapy for this disease. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of HCQ are not without many side effects, which range from mild gastrointestinal effects to life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological effects. In this review, we explore the controversy associated with the repurposing of HCQ to manage or treat COVID-19, and we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of HCQ.IntroductionCoronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, and usually cause mild acute respiratory illnesses or “common cold” (Su et al., 2016). In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in China (Huang et al., 2020).

This patient had always been considered highly adherent to his medications, which was confirmed by therapeutic drug monitoring. Because plasma concentration was within therapeutic range by the time the patient was admitted, the failure of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 cannot be attributed to underdosage or suboptimal adherence. Two recent studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine provides no protection against COVID-19 in patients with a broad range of autoimmune diseases from New York, USA (3), and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from France (4). The case we present is unique in that the patient was not receiving any immunomodulatory agent other than hydroxychloroquine.

For people with COVID-19, the antibodies get into the circulation before the body can make its own antibodies, which gives a kick-start in fighting the virus. For those exposed but not yet infected, antibodies can be a line of defense that prevents the virus from gaining a foothold in the body. Anyone with COVID-19 at higher risk for progressing to severe disease is eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment. To receive monoclonal antibodies for treatment, you must have a positive test for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19 and be within 10 days of when your symptoms began.

Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?,https://www.webmd.com/covid/monoclonal-antibodies-covid," Research seems to show that some mAbs, when used correctly, may help some people with COVID-19.How Do Monoclonal Antibodies Work?To make monoclonal antibodies, scientists expose a specific type of cell from the immune system to a particular viral protein -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They can then design the mAb to target a particular virus or a specific part of the infection process.For COVID-19, scientists made several mAbs that bind to the spike protein on the virus's surface. This stops the virus from invading human cells.Recommendations for COVID-19 mAb treatments are in constant flux. So check the CDC or other government websites for the latest recommendations.

Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?,https://time.com/6189990/monoclonal-antibodies-covid-19-treatment/," Most monoclonal antibodies don’t last very long in the bloodstream. That’s why they’re only used after a person has been infected. But one type of monoclonal antibody, called Evusheld (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) can stay in the blood and provide protection for about six months before exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The FDA recommends this option for patients who can’t get vaccinated because they’re allergic to the shot’s ingredients or are immunocompromised severely enough that they won’t mount a sufficient response to the vaccine. Do monoclonal antibodies still work?

This can be mass produced and given to people through an IV.A monoclonal antibody targets a specific antigen on a virus or bacteria. So this treatment differs from convalescent plasma, which contains multiple antibodies that target different antigens.Most of the monoclonal antibodies being developed to treat COVID-19 target the spike protein, which the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) uses to enter the host cells.By binding to the spike protein, a monoclonal antibody can help prevent the virus from infecting human cells.Research suggests that certain monoclonal antibodies can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.Scientists are also looking at whether this treatment can reduce the risk of someone with COVID-19 transmitting the virus to others in their household.Who can get monoclonal antibody treatment?Several monoclonal antibodies have received emergency use authorization from the FDA:REGEN-COV.

To clean the floors in your kitchen and bathroom, the CDC recommends using one cup of bleach mixed with five gallons of water to mop your floors. The EPA list includes Maquat products that you can dilute and use to clean hard, nonporous areas, like glazed tile floors -- but you should avoid getting it on your grout.Note that you'll need to use a different disinfectant for porous floors -- for example, if you use bleach on hardwood, it can remove the stain color.

But what is the most effective way to prevent exposure to the virus? Like other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19, is thought to spread most commonly through invisible respiratory droplets sent into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Those droplets can then be inhaled by nearby people or land on surfaces that others then touch, who can then get infected when they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. The good news from investigations of the coronavirus spread, says Juan Leon, an environmental health scientist at Emory University, is that past studies show common household disinfectants, including soap or a diluted bleach solution, can deactivate coronaviruses on indoor surfaces.

Why you can trust Sky News


Americans trying to prevent COVID-19 infections have reported cleaning their food and themselves with disinfectant and bleach, with some even inhaling or drinking the household cleaning products, a study has found.According to research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly four in 10 people (39%) admitted to actions the health protection agency would consider dangerous. The study took place in May shortly after President Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat COVID-19. Image:

Of the 502 adults surveyed, 19% said they had put bleach on food, including fruit and vegetables, while 18% admitted using household cleaning and disinfectant products on their hands or skin.Some 4% had drank or gargled bleach solutions, soapy water or disinfectants, 6% had inhaled vapours from household cleaners or disinfectants, and 10% said they had misted their body with a cleaning or disinfectant spray. Health officials have cautioned explicitly against such behaviour.The online poll analysed household cleaning habits during the coronavirus pandemic. More on Covid-19

We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19. One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19.

COVID-19's stealth impact on children 











NYC doctor says COVID-19 may be much more widespread in children
09:55




As fears of the coronavirus continue to spread in the United States, some people have turned to unorthodox, unproven and even dangerous methods to attempt to ward off the disease. Now, rumors are spreading that breast milk could contain COVID-19 antibodies, but doctors say there's no evidence to support that claim. ""There's no proof that breast milk at all can cure COVID or give you antibodies,"" Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician with New York City's Gramercy Pediatrics, told CBSN's Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers on Tuesday. ""There's no data that I know of that has been published yet about it."" For years, people have been selling and buying human breast milk online for adult consumption, touting its supposed benefits as a ""superfood"" with immune-boosting properties. These claims have been repeatedly debunked by doctors, who say drinking breast milk as an adult has no health benefit and can lead to a number of illnesses.",breast milk can't prevent or cure COVID-19 in adults,no

A new study has shown that human breast milk may help prevent or treat Covid-19.Beijing University of Chemical Technology experts say that whey proteins in breast milk can inhibit Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, by ""blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication"".The researchers' findings, published on pre-print specialist site biorxiv.org, have not yet been peer-reviewed.However, they also claim that whey proteins in cow and goat milk may offer a similar, though less effective, protection.According to the British newspaper The Times newspaper, the Chinese experts found that ""cow and goat whey proteins could suppress the coronavirus by about 70%, but the efficacy of human whey was far more impressive at 98%"".The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that mothers infected with the coronavirus should continue breastfeeding their babies.For the latest Chinese study, cells from the human gut and lungs were exposed to Sars-CoV-2.The researchers then examined the impact of breast milk, which had been collected in 2017, had on the cells.According to The Times, the team ""observed almost no viral binding or entry to these healthy cells, as well as the halting of viral replication in already-infected cells"". ""Human milk was able to eliminate the virus in a broader range of cell types"" than animal milk, ""but the researchers said it was unclear what had caused the difference"", adds the South China Morning Post.According to The Week, there has been further reassurance for mothers. The Week says a recent US study outlined in a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that breast milk does not spread the coronavirus and ""may not be a source of infection for the infant"". Researchers are now looking into whether breast milk could be used as a treatment for Covid-19. More news from

In a recent study, researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine and University of California Los Angeles collaborated to find the answer.The study, published August 19, 2020 in the online edition of

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2020/breast-milk-shows-promise-treating-covid-19-and-protecting-babies," This is good news because it opens the door to using breast milk from COVID-19-recovered mothers to treat critically ill babies or prevent severe illness in vulnerable infants. While our small study of 15 moms only gives us a snapshot of what is likely a dynamic immune response, it provides good reason to continue exploring the power of human milk to treat or prevent COVID-19 in infants. We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19. One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19. This suggests that breast milk may have some general immune properties that help babies fight COVID-19, even if mothers have never been infected with the disease.

The immune system is a marvel of evolution, and it is far from being fully understood. The newest immunological head-scratcher: Researchers have found that being vaccinated recently for something other than coronavirus — say, a hepatitis or measles vaccine — makes one more resistant to COVID-19. In an article published last month by the journal Scientific Reports, scientists found that a number of different vaccines were associated with lower rates of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. These included the vaccines for Geriatric Flu, Haemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), hepatitis A/hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella, pneumococcal conjugate, polio and Varicella. In particular, the patients studied who had been vaccinated against polio and HIB generally had the lowest relative risk for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 across all time horizons.",being vaccinated recently for something other than coronavirus,neutral
Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/florida-governor-ron-desantis-bivalent-booster-infection/," Broadly speaking, COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection; they prevent the virus from spreading within the body and causing severe illness, according to John Hopkins University. Early CDC research shows that people who got the booster were 84% less likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19. The data collected on the booster’s ability to curb infection is early and limited; some clinical trials have shown that bivalent shots are no more equipped to prevent people from contracting COVID-19 than the original vaccines. Although some people have suggested the bivalent COVID-19 booster offers little protection against infection, DeSantis went further. He said people who received the bivalent booster shot were more susceptible to COVID-19 than those who hadn’t. The governor’s press office responded to PolitiFact’s inquiry about the claim shortly after publication, citing two articles and three studies, two of which are not yet peer reviewed.",do not prevent infection,no
Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/07/hiv-medications-may-lower-risk-covid-getting-severe-coronavirus-symptoms/," Researchers think this might be because the small molecular size of tenofovir diphosphate, an active chemical in TDF, “fits better in the active site” of cells where coronavirus would usually attach and begin to replicate itself.

Understanding Impact of COVID-19 on Hib Vaccine Market


Published: Jun 26, 2020




Description: 

Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) is a bacterium which causes several diseases such as pneumonia, epiglottitis, meningitis, and sepsis mostly in children younger than 5 years
In infants and young children, Hib disease can cause serious health issues. Infection can spread to different parts of the body — including the brain, throat, spinal cord, and lungs. These infections can even cause serious implication on child’s health; they can be deadly. For example, Hib meningitis causes brain damage or hearing loss in 1 in 5 children who survive it. The Hib vaccine is the best way to protect the child from Hib disease
Two types of vaccines are available that can be used against Hib disease:
	
The Hib vaccine protects children and adults from Hib disease
The DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine protects babies ranging from 2 to 18 months from Hib disease, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio

Scientists around the world are racing to find ways out of the new coronavirus pandemic. Some are working to develop new drugs and vaccines, while others are looking to see whether therapies we already have may help against COVID-19.In the latter category, researchers have dusted off one intriguing compound in our collective medicine cabinet — a century-old vaccine to fight tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. A couple of early analyses, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that countries that require this vaccine, called Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), seemed to have been hit less severely, in terms of both number and severity, by the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.Could this vaccine be protecting people from COVID-19?

Provisional monthly data for the period of 1 September to 30 November 2022 shows that some of this momentum was maintained initially although uptake rates are slightly lower in most cohorts than the previous 2 years. However, for those aged 65 years and over, the World Health Organization (WHO) target of a 75% uptake rate has again been exceeded and for school-aged children the figures are comparable to the previous highest season on record (in 2020 to 2021) for this point in the season. Provisional data:

school-aged children
healthcare workers
GP patients

The latest data (1 September to 31 December 2022) will be published on Thursday 26 January 2023 and will be available at the links above. GP services and pharmacies are contracted to offer flu vaccination until 31 March 2023 so if anyone presents who is eligible but not yet had their flu vaccine there is still time to vaccinate them; it’s not too late and it gives the best protection against serious illness.

Once-a-day inhaler offers ‘powerful protection’ against COVID-19: Researchers


















                          US scientists believe they have produced a molecule that could change the course of the pandemic. US scientists have come up with a molecule that is highly protective against the coronavirus – and because it can be administered by a nasal spray or inhaler, they say it could replace the need for personal protective equipment (PPE). The researchers have named the molecule “AeroNabs” – which is what happens when nerds are in a hurry to get their discovery to market. The University of California San Francisco (UCFS) scientists believe they can deliver cheap and effective protection as an over-the-counter product, like fungal cream.","

Can inhalers help COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-june-4-2021," The most common side effects associated with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are headache, dizziness, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), chest pain, pharyngitis (sore throat), and rhinitis (runny nose). The FDA recognizes the increased demand for certain products during the COVID-19 public health emergency and has prioritized the review of generic drug applications for potential treatments and supportive therapies for patients with COVID-19. We remain deeply committed to facilitating access to safe and effective medical products to help address critical needs of the American public. On June 3, the FDA posted an update to the SARS-CoV-2 Viral Mutations: Impact on COVID-19 Tests web page to share the latest information. The update added new information about a potential impact on the performance of the Mesa Biotech Inc. Accula SARS-CoV-2 Test due to a genetic mutation at positions 28877-28878 (AG to TC) in patient samples. The FDA reissued the Letter of Authorization for REGEN-COV (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) treatment for COVID-19 to authorize:

    Treatments for COVID-19



May 18, 2022


What helps, what doesn't, and what's in the pipeline

Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19. Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19 in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness. Scientists continue working hard to develop other effective treatments.",Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu,neutral

Another study found that omega-3 supplements improved survival rates and lung and kidney function in patients in the hospital with COVID-19, but more research is needed. Several other clinical trials are underway to see whether omega-3s help reduce the risk of COVID-19 or help reduce symptoms in people who have COVID-19, but results are not yet available.

Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.

Several dietary supplement ingredients are being examined for their ability to protect against and improve immune response to COVID-19. Also, several clinical trials are testing the effects of dietary supplement ingredients, including omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, and vitamin D, in patients with COVID-19. NIH’s Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) reviewed this research to see if these supplements showed an ability to promote an immune response to COVID-19 and to understand any potential safety issues or side effects.

The Omega-3 Index in the samples was analyzed, and the results studied in answering the question, “Is a higher Omega-3 Index associated with a lower risk for death from COVID-19?”
Bearing in mind this was a pilot study with a modest number of subjects, the findings suggested high levels of omega-3 corresponded with lower death risk. Of the 14 patients who died in the pilot study, only one was in the highest “quartile” (i.e., among the 25 patients with the highest Omega-3 Index, a value of 5.7% or greater). The other 13 were in the group with an Omega-3 Index below 5.7%. When analyzing the data statistically, the group with the highest Omega-3 Index was found 75% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those with an Omega-3 Index below 5.7%.

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/omega-3-fatty-acids-and-their-impact-on-covid-19," Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid which cannot be made from the body. It can be found in many foods such as plant oils, nuts, flaxseeds and seafoods. They are an important component of cell membranes and are associated with a lower risk of several diseases.In a pilot study published in the journal Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids, investigators provided the first bits of evidence that individuals with higher levels of omega-3 in their blood may potentially be at a reduced risk of dying from COVID-19.In a conversation with two of the lead authors, William Harris, PhD, a professor of internal medicine at the University of South Dakota and Michael Myers, MD, a physician at the Los Alamitos Medical Center, they discuss the important findings from their study.“What we found was that people in the highest quartile of Omega-3s, 1 person died, and in the lower 3 quartiles, 13 people died,” Harris said. “ When we did the statistics, we found that it wasn’t quite statistically significant by standard metrics, but it was very close to it.”“It is most likely very real, we're working on trying to do a larger and more detailed study to confirm everything,” Myers said.Related VideosView AllRelated ContentWorld Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023Related Content World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023ArticlesHow Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022Podcasts “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023ArticlesCOVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022PodcastsAs US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023ArticlesEnoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023ArticlesAbout UsAdvertiseEditorialContact UsDo Not Sell My InformationPrivacyTerms & ConditionsContact Info2 Clarke Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2023 MJH Life Sciences   All rights reserved.",individuals with higher levels of omega-3,neutral

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.chiroeco.com/omega-3-6-9/," One of these patients was from the group of 25 patients with omega 3 indices of greater than 5.7%, while the other 13 deaths came from the other three groups of patients with indices less than 5.7%.5
In running a statistical analysis, the researchers concluded that the 25 patients in the top group were 75% less likely to die than the 75 patients in the remaining three groups.5 This meant that patients with omega 3 indices lower than 5.7% were four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those with omega 3 indices above 5.7 %. The researchers speculated that omega 3’s ability to rapidly block inflammation signaling can stop the cytokine storm from building up, thereby preventing the acute respiratory distress that can lead to death in severe cases of COVID-19.5 As the lead researcher noted: “While not meeting standard statistical significance thresholds, this pilot study – along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA – strongly suggests that these nutritionally available marine fatty acids may help reduce risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.”
Taking omega 3-6-9 as part of a daily wellness routine to prevent chronic disease is always recommended. However, this new research indicates that people who are at increased risk of being hospitalized from COVID-19 may derive even more benefit from omega 3-6-9. References

April 19, 2021But protective effects seen only among women.Taking multivitamins, omega-3, probiotics, or vitamin D supplements may lessen the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infection — at least among women — indicates a large population study, published online in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health.But taking any of vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements wasn’t associated with a lower risk of testing positive for the virus, the findings show.There has been plenty of celebrity endorsement of the use of dietary supplements to both ward off and treat COVID-19 infection since the start of the pandemic, note the researchers.In the UK alone, market share rose by 19.5% in the period leading up to the first national ‘lockdown’ on March 23 last year, with sales of vitamin C rising by 110% and those of multivitamins by 93%.Similarly, zinc supplement sales rose by 415% in the first week of March, at the height of COVID-19 fears in the USA.Dietary supplements can help to support a healthy immune system, but whether specific supplements might be associated with a lower risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 isn’t known.In a bid to plug this knowledge gap, the researchers drew on adult users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app to see if regular supplement users were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2.The app was launched in the UK, the US, and Sweden in March 2020 to capture self-reported information on the evolution of the pandemic.Initially, it recorded the location, age, and core health risk factors of its users. But as time went on, subscribers were asked to provide daily updates on a range of issues, including symptoms, coronavirus test results, and healthcare. People without obvious symptoms were also encouraged to use it.For the purposes of this study, the researchers analyzed information supplied by 372,720 UK subscribers to the app about their regular use of dietary supplements throughout May, June, and July 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic as well as any coronavirus swab test results.Between May and July,175,652 UK subscribers regularly took dietary supplements;197,068 didn’t. Around two thirds (67%) were women and over half were overweight (BMI of 27).In all, 23,521 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 349,199 tested negative between May and July.Taking probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, or vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection: by 14%, 12%, 13%, and 9%, respectively, after accounting for potentially influential factors, including underlying conditions and usual diet.No such effects were observed among those taking vitamin C, zinc, or garlic supplements.And when the researchers looked specifically at sex, age and weight (BMI), the protective associations for probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamins, and vitamin D were observed only in women of all ages and weights. No such clear associations were seen in men.Despite some differences, the same overall patterns were mirrored in both the US (45,757) and Swedish (27,373) subscribers.The equivalent figures for the US and Sweden were a reduced risk of:18% and 37%, respectively for probiotics; 21% and 16%, respectively, for omega-3 fatty acids; 12% and 22%, respectively for multivitamins; and 24% and 19%, respectively, for vitamin D supplements.This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause.",lessen the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2,neutral

In China and India, there are also trials registered to study Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and nutraceutical formulations. According to one of the largest clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov from the US, there are 657 registered trials related to COVID-19 as of April 20.This does not include another 215 trials related to the term ‘SARS-CoV-2’, 33 studies related to the term ‘2019-nCoV’, 18 studies on ‘2019 novel coronavirus’, and 15 studies on ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2’.It should be noted that some of these trials are not yet recruiting or have even withdrawn.NutraIngredients-Asia​ also found relevant trials from India’s and Australia’s clinical trials registries.

B cells are involved in antibody production and cytokine (regulate immunity and inflammation) secretion (9) which is enhanced in lean and obese mice by FOO3s (10). There is evidence in rodent studies that DHA is more effective than EPA (10). Newly diagnosed diabetics have a decreased production of B cell cytokines and obese humans and mice (two of the risk factors for COVID-19) have a lower antibody response to influenza infection (utilizes same ACE-2 receptor) or vaccination. In these same mice, DHA improved “influenza-specific antibody production” (10).

Melatonin and famotidine, an over-the-counter acid reflux medication sold under brand names including Pepcid, are also being studied for COVID-19 treatment. Both were given to former President Donald Trump when he was hospitalized with the disease, along with zinc, vitamin D and other therapies. But similar to vitamin D, there's not enough research to support their use. In fact, the NIH in its COVID-19 treatment guidelines recommends against taking zinc supplements above the recommended dietary allowance (11 milligrams per day for men and 8 milligrams for women) for the prevention of COVID-19. It also recommends against the use of famotidine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in clinical trials.",combination therapies,neutral

Omega-3 Fatty Acids







Last review completed on
February 7th, 2021


Therapy Description
One of the main causes of death in patients with COVID-19 is multiorgan failure due to the immune system going into overdrive and causing a cytokine storm. Omega-3 is known to produce less pre-inflammatory cytokines. Theoretically increasing the intake of omega-3 could promote better immune function and potentially decrease the severity of the immune response in those diagnosed with COVID-19. Recommendation
Not recommended due to a lack of any completed clinical trials. Clinical Circumstances

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779984/," Omega-3 FAs, such as DHA and EPA, perform their role by being incorporated in the cell membrane and affecting the clumping of toll-like receptors and thus preventing signals that activate NF-κB and help to ameliorate complications of COVID-19 by producing fewer pro-inflammatory mediators. DHA and EPA are precursors of particles called resolvins D and E, which reduce the proinflammatory mediators thereby reducing pulmonary neutrophils recruitment, increasing apoptosis by macrophages, and subsequently decreasing broncho-alveolar IL-6 production and as a result, decreasing inflammation of the lung. Omega-3 FA plays a role in increasing the phagocytic capacity of macrophages due to the changes in the composition of the cell membrane bilipid layer. Omega-3 FAs also play a role in mediating inflammatory processes and immunomodulation for both innate and acquired immune systems.It is necessary to understand that the link between omega-3 FA-rich diet and the clinical outcome could be far more complex than previously considered when treating COVID-19 patients. At the very least, this information could serve as the impetus that initiates further conversation and investigation into dietary supplementation that can be considered in both hospitalized patients and patients at home. Several clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the most appropriate treatment for SARS-CoV-2.",preventing signals that activate NF-κB,neutral

Your immune system consists of a complex collection of cells, processes, and chemicals that constantly defends your body against invading pathogens, including viruses, toxins, and bacteria (1, 2). Keeping your immune system healthy year-round is key to preventing infection and disease. Making healthy lifestyle choices by consuming nutritious foods and getting enough sleep and exercise are the most important ways to bolster your immune system.In addition, research has shown that supplementing with certain vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances can help improve immune response and potentially protect against illness.",no research supports the use of any supplement,no
Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/miscellaneous-drugs/intravenous-immunoglobulin/," This recommendation should not preclude the use of IVIG when otherwise indicated for the treatment of complications that arise during the course of COVID-19.Considerations in ChildrenNo pediatric comparative studies have evaluated the use of IVIG in patients with acute COVID-19. IVIG is used in pediatric patients for other indications, such as in combination with glucocorticoids for the initial immunomodulatory treatment of MIS-C.4-7 However, given the lack of clear evidence of IVIG efficacy for the treatment of acute COVID-19 in adults, the Panel recommends against the use of IVIG for the treatment of acute COVID-19 in children, except in a clinical trial (AIII). This recommendation should not preclude the use of IVIG when otherwise indicated.For the Panel’s recommendations for children with MIS-C, see Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Pediatric Patients With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) (With Discussion on Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults [MIS-A]).ReferencesLai CC, Chen WC, Chen CY, Wei YF.

      Five severely ill COVID-19 patients in whom standard treatments failed were administrated with IVIG which prevented the deterioration of clinical symptoms. All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3-0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. Conclusion:
        
      
      Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3-0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed. Keywords:

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA.",High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) improves outcomes,neutral
Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109645," The benefit of IVIg in severe and critically ill COVID-19 is not well understood, however several studies suggest that it targets the post-infectious inflammatory response of the cytokine storm by scavenging complement, regulating effector T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and regulatory T-cells while inhibiting host innate immune cell activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Its action to reduce elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory markers of inflammation early in the course of COVID-19 illness is consistent with downregulation of the immune response. While current batches of IVIg may neutralize seasonal coronavirus species, it generally lacks cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [20]. Although passive virus neutralization appears to not be responsible for the beneficial effects of IVIg in treating COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 encodes one superantigen motif near its S1/S2 cleavage site that might trigger the cytokine storm [21]. As IVIg contains antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [22], IVIg might inhibit superantigen-mediated T-cell activation, cytokine release and an incipient cytokine storm. 3.",neutralize seasonal coronavirus species,neutral

Some Studies Suggest Intravenous Immunoglobulin Could Help Treat COVID-19


Published: May 04, 2020

Researchers finding ways to use intravenous immunoglobulin for COVID-19 treatment. As researchers and physicians try to identify ways to effectively treat and prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, some are studying whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) could work. IVIg is a common blood plasma product that is used to treat other immune disorders. IVIg is purified from the mixed plasma of healthy people, with protein being the main component, which is abundant in bacterial antibodies and viral Immunoglobulin G (IgG). It is clinically used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of severe pneumonia caused by influenza, in addition to other immune disorders. There have now been several small studies of the use of IVIg in treating COVID-19.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral
Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-021-01717-x," We confirmed these results after propensity score matching to account for the differences between the two groups.Only a few randomized controlled studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia. Gharebaghi et al. have reported that administration of IVIG to 30 patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatment significantly reduced the in-hospital mortality (20.0% in the treatment group vs. 48.3% in the control group; P = 0.025). However, the authors did not report the severity of ARDS and the percentage of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation [14]. Another pilot randomized controlled trial showed that IVIG 0.5 g/kg daily for three days with concomitant methylprednisolone 40 mg significantly improved hypoxia and reduced progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID19 patients [15]. The clinical improvement found in this study cannot be generalized because of the small sample size and concomitant use of methylprednisolone therapy that may have confounded the results.",significantly reduced the in-hospital mortality,neutral

Based on treatment options, patients were divided into two groups, standard COVID-19 treatment (109 patients) and IVIG treatment (74 patients) patients. Also, the effect of IVIG in different dosages was evaluated. Patients with IVIG treatment were divided into three groups of low (0.25 gr/kg), medium (0.5 gr/kg), and high (1 gr/kg) dose. Data analysis was performed using an independent t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the outcomes between two groups, including duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate.RESULTS: The duration of hospitalization in the IVIG group was significantly longer than standard treatment (13.74 days vs. 11.10 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in ICU length of stay, the number of intubated patients, and duration of mechanical ventilation (p > 0.05).",Our study aims to access the efficacy,neutral

The National Institutes of Health says it can neither recommend nor suggest against using ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19, while the FDA strongly recommends against using the drug, particularly in the form designed to be used in animals.But the public has been slow to get the message. According to data from prescription savings service, SingleCare, there was a 1,126% increase in ivermectin prescriptions in January 2021 compared to a year earlier, and a 464% increase in February 2021 compared to February 2020. Interferons, immune proteins that modulate the response of the immune system to viruses, are crucial for mounting an immune response. The inhaled version of interferons was found to be quite effective for hospitalized patients.A study out late last year found some people with life-threatening COVID-19 had genetic quirks that left them interferon-deficient.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) could be a key to combating seriously ill COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized due to complications from the disease, and Octapharma AG aims to find out as it assesses the plasma-based treatment in a Phase III study. Huub Kreuwel, vice president of Scientific and Medical Affairs at Octapharma USA, explained to BioSpace that COVID-19-related deaths are typically due to the body’s overactive immune response to the disease. The role of IVIG is not to target the virus, but to help calm that overactive immune response by decreasing multiple cytokines at one time. The use of IVIG is more of a blanket approach than Genentech and Regeneron’s earlier attempts to calm the cytokine storm by inhibiting interleukin-6 with rheumatoid arthritis drugs. IVIG contains antibodies that are harvested from plasma provided by thousands of donors across the country. IVIG, which is injected into patients, has been used in the past to help patients fight off various infections, including Kawasaki disease, which is similar to an infection some pediatric COVID-19 patients have developed as a result of the novel coronavirus.","Plasma, R&D",neutral

Convalescent plasma, and then IVIG, could provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19, especially those who are older and at much higher risk for complications. A monoclonal antibody drug could reach a greater number of patients. We also need antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, being tested by Gilead Sciences.

The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency.

The study enrolled 33 COVID-19 patients experiencing hypoxia who were at risk of requiring mechanical ventilation. “In this first prospective randomized study evaluating IVIg in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, the use of IVIg reduced the rate of progression of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients (13% with IVIg vs. 41% without IVIg, p=0.12),” said Dr. Sakoulas, Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics of the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. “While this did not achieve statistical significance among the collective subject cohorts, the reduced rate of progression to mechanical ventilation with IVIg achieved statistical significance among the subset with a calculated or estimated A-a (Alveolar–arterial) gradient of > 200 mm Hg (14% with IVIG vs. 58% without IVIg, p=0.038).”1


“This finding points not only to a potential benefit of IVIG in COVID-19, but the importance of optimal patient selection for IVIg in maximizing clinical benefit,” Dr. Sakoulas added. “COVID-19 patients with mild hypoxia may never warrant anything more than supportive low-flow oxygen therapy, such that intervening with IVIg may not change the course of an otherwise benign disease course. A cutoff A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg was chosen due to the fact that this represents a notable risk increase in APACHE 2 score calculation in predicting mortality.",may never warrant anything more than supportive low-flow oxygen therapy,no
Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05507-4," Due to the anti-cytokine effects, inhibition of complement activation, and down-regulation of B and T cells’ functions, IVIg can prevent the excessive body damage when administered at the initial stages of severe infection; therefore, considering this mechanism of action, after permanent tissue damage it would not be effective [22]. Thereupon, early administration of IVIg in server cases of COVID-19 is important [21]. Cao et al. also reported desirable results in the treatment of 3 patients with severe COVID-19 using 25 g/day of IVIg consecutively for 5 days [17]. Our results suggest that IVIg administration of 20 g/day for three consecutive days could be effective and safe in a larger, Iranian population.Shao et al. conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study on 325 COVID-19 patients, 222 (68%) with severe COVID-19 and 103 (32%) with critical COVID-19.",IVIg can prevent the excessive body damage,neutral

Diagnostic tests for neuropathy revealed that 62.5% of lower leg skin biopsies and 50% of upper thigh biopsies and autonomic function tests confirmed SFN.The treatments included IV immunoglobulins (IVIg) — the primary treatment for inflammatory neuropathy, with early evidence for treating SFN — and corticosteroids. Most of those who received the IVIg treatment perceived improvement in their symptoms, and the same was true for some of those on corticosteroids. The researchers noted that some of the participants also made a spontaneous recovery. Due to this, they acknowledge in their paper the need to individualize treatment decisions for patients.

Stakeholders expressed concerns about the failure of Remestemcel-L to reach its death-risk end points in the initial cohort of patients. However, the results shown in a prespecified subgroup analysis found remestemcel-L in combination with standard of care (dexamethasone) significantly reduced death rates in patients younger than 65 years. Stakeholders thought that, because many COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized fall into this age group, the treatment might have a substantial impact on patient health outcomes. The treatment might substantially reduce the burden on hospital resources and costs if the length of hospital stays is reduced and fewer intensive resources are needed. However, stakeholders were also concerned that, if expensive, treatment with remestemcel-L might increase disparities for individuals in need.",might provide a novel treatment,neutral

It is now evident that in both adults and children COVID-19 causes severe inflammation of other organ systems in addition to the lungs, including the heart, brain and kidneys. The immunomodulatory mechanism of action of remestemcel-L may be beneficial in the treatment of ARDS as well as in involvement of other organ systems.Indeed, nine of 12 ventilator-dependent adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who received two doses of remestemcel-L under emergency compassionate use at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital were successfully discharged within a median of 10 days. Additionally, two COVID-19 infected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) who received remestemcel-L for severe heart failure fully recovered heart function and were discharged within 30 hours of the second dose.To confirm these pilot data, remestemcel-L is being evaluated for its potential to reduce mortality in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS. The dosing regimen in the Phase 3 is the same as in the pilot trial.

Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in management of COVID-19 induced ARDS. The primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory biomarkers. Condition or disease

Remestemcel-L in COVID 19 ARDS Timelines for clinical trials in the age of coronavirus have been compressed remarkably and Mesoblast has quickly progressed to recruitment for its Phase 2-3 trial despite only announcing that it was testing Remestemcel-L in COVID-19 patients two months ago. The trial is being performed with the support of the NIH following initial promising results from its open label trial at Mt Sinai Hospital which has helped to bring trial sites online rapidly with 12 sites already currently recruiting. Unlike previous trials, Remestemcel-L has been used in COVID-19 patients with an extremely high expected mortality as they are intubated with moderate to severe ARDS. The reported mortality rates with standard of care for this cohort of patients are upwards of 80% and somewhat remarkedly Mesoblast has instead reported 83% (10/12) survival following treatment with Remestemcel-L in its open label trial. This is a key differentiator as mortality is a hard end point that is far less prone to bias. Mortality rates with standard of care for COVID-19 ARDS will likely be lower than this 80-90% figure quoted by Mesoblast for patients enrolled in the clinical trial as completely moribund patients are unlikely to be recruited but the control mortality rate will likely still be high.",If Remestemcel-L were to fail,neutral

Phase 3 trial testing on severely ill COVID-19 patients has reached 50 per cent enrolment
Mesoblast expects to complete enrolment of the study by the end of the year
Waiting for readouts of its phase 3 studies on using stem cell treatments to treat heart failure and lower back pain

Closely watched biotech Mesoblast (ASX:MSB) says that over 150 severely ill COVID-19 patients on ventilators have been enrolled in a study of its stem cell treatment, remestemcel-L.
That’s over half of the 300 patients needed for phase 3 trial to see if Mesoblast’s inflammation-fighting treatment cuts death rates in the severely ill COVID-19 patients. A pilot study involving just a dozen COVID-19 patients on ventilators being treated at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital in March and April suggested the intravenous transfusion worked wonders, with nine of the 12 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being discharged from the hospital in an average of just 10 days. “There is an urgent need for targeted treatments to reduce the continued high mortality in COVID-19 ARDS patients who are dependent on mechanical ventilators,” Mesoblast chief medical officer Dr Fred Grossman said. “We expect to complete the enrolment target in this important trial by the end of the year as the enrolment rate continues to increase in line with the surge in new infections across the United States.”
Because the trial is a randomised, double-blinded, controlled study – the “gold standard” of clinical trials – Mesoblast has no way to know at this stage whether the drug is working to improve patient outcomes. But an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recently completed an interim analysis of the trial’s safety and efficacy based on 30 days of data from the first 90 patients enrolled, and recommended that the trial continue as planned.",There is an urgent need for targeted treatments to reduce the continued high mortality,neutral

Indeed, nine of 12 ventilator-dependent adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS who received two doses of remestemcel-L under emergency compassionate use at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital were successfully discharged within a median of 10 days. Additionally, two COVID-19 infected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) who received remestemcel-L for severe heart failure fully recovered heart function and were discharged within 30 hours of the second dose. To confirm these pilot data, remestemcel-L is being evaluated for its potential to reduce mortality in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS.

A big concern many have had during the pandemic (especially during warmer months) has been if mosquitoes can spread the coronavirus. With malaria being the most well-known, mosquitoes are notorious spreaders of viral illnesses (such as the EEE outbreak from last summer). Researchers, however, have determined that mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed it has no data to support coronavirus transmission via mosquito bite, and, similarly, the World Health Organization said bites will not pass along the virus. Researchers have said that in order for mosquitoes to be able to pass the virus along to a human, the mosquito would first have to become infected with the coronavirus and have it replicate within it. Testing multiple species of mosquitoes, none became infected with the coronavirus.",mosquitoes do not spread COVID-19,no

According to a new study from Kansas State University, mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, published in Scientific Reports on July 17, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 cannot reproduce within mosquitoes and cannot be transmitted to humans through a bite.﻿﻿﻿

COVID-19, however, has never been seen before, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2. As a whole, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and can affect different species of animals, but rarely can an animal coronavirus infect a human and then spread between people.

The WHO has definitively stated that mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus1, and in interviews, various experts have unanimously and definitively also dispelled the suggestion that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The presumption may be based on various observations and facts extrapolated from other coronaviruses. For example, neither the closely related SARS-CoV nor MERS produce the level of virus in the blood that for typical arthropod-borne viruses such as dengue and yellow fever, would be regarded as high enough to infect mosquitoes. Recent studies with infected humans and non-human primates infected with SARS-CoV-2, found no detectable virus in peripheral blood2,3. Lack of viremia is also suggested by the fact that neither SARS-CoV nor MERS infections have resulted from blood transfusions or organ transplantations.",can infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes,neutral

A new article published March 4 in the Journal of Medical Entomology describes how researchers from Kansas State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service evaluated whether mosquitoes and biting midges can serve as biological vectors for COVID-19. Their results align with numerous studies conducted thus far. “The answer is none of these seem to support SARS-CoV-2 replication,” says Richt, Regents Distinguished Professor of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University and Director of KSU’s Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (CEZID). “So, we think that these species are unable to be biological vectors of SARS-CoV-2.”

It's extremely unlikely mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19 according to entomology professor




















By: Emma Ea Ambrose 










April 21, 2020






















“There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes,” Catherine Hill, professor of entomology and vector biology, said. In the swells of information that have surrounded the COVID-19 pandemic, Hill said one question that keeps popping up is whether animals, including mosquitoes, can infect humans with the virus. Scientists around the world are currently assessing if  mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission but, so far, there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitos are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), in this family are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said.",It’s extremely unlikely,neutral

""Lawrence Stanberry, director of the programs in global health at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, said that in the past, researchers have tried to infect mosquitoes with coronavirus for studies, but have been unsuccessful.

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-06-25/column-california-mosquitoes," “Combining this with the human-driven availability of water from landscaping, agricultural use and small containers in yards, we have essentially created an ideal environment for them.”Thanks, climate change!Every mosquito maven I spoke with told me the same. Our warming environment is like Christmas for the Aedes mosquito, providing the aggressive, bloodthirsty little creatures with ideal circumstances in which to proliferate.“As the climate becomes warmer, we run the risk that these mosquitoes will spread into new areas, and with that the increased potential of mosquito-borne disease,” said Ryan C. Smith, an associate professor of entomology at Iowa State University.He cited the Aedes mosquito’s “strong human preferences” and the fact that they’re “aggressive daytime biters.”“While for the time being this is just a nuisance,” Smith said, “it is important from the perspective that these mosquito species have the potential to transmit a wide range of mosquito-borne viruses.”He cited an outbreak of the Zika virus in Florida in 2016. Zika has been linked to birth defects, brain disorders and other illnesses.“Aedes aegypti in Florida were able to promote Zika virus transmission in and around Miami once it was introduced by human travel,” Smith said.Which brings us back to COVID-19. As Akbari said, researchers wasted little time trying to determine if the virus could be spread by mosquitoes, including Aedes aegypti.The conclusion, as reported a year ago in the scientific journal Nature, is that it can’t, “even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host.”But Akbari and other specialists say we aren’t in the clear. Next time, they say, things could be different.“As Aedes aegypti becomes more and more prevalent,” Akbari told me, “we could see transmission of more and more pathogens.”Basically, it’s just a matter of chance.“If a person infected with the dengue virus or another virus transmitted by these mosquitoes were to come to California, and that individual was bitten, then it is possible that diseases such as dengue could then be spread,” said Craig Montell, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at UC Santa Barbara.“Dengue causes a wide spectrum of disease,” says the World Health Organization. While many people infected with the virus experience only flu-like symptoms, severe cases can lead to bleeding, organ impairment and death.What can we do?“That’s a tough one,” replied Jason L.

It’s actually unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus when it bites an infected person due to the low concentrations of the HIV circulating in their blood.For Ebola, even when scientists inject the virus into mosquitoes, they don’t become infected. One study collected tens of thousands of insects during an Ebola outbreak but found no virus.No, not coronavirusThe new coronavirus is mostly spread via droplets produced when we sneeze or cough, and by touching contaminated surfaces.Although coronavirus has been found in blood samples from infected people, there’s no evidence it can spread via mosquitoes.Even if a mosquito did pick up a high enough dose of the virus in a blood meal, there is no evidence the virus would be able to infect the mosquito itself.And if the mosquito isn’t infected, it won’t be able to transmit it to the next person she bites.Why some viruses and not others?It’s easy to think of mosquitoes as tiny flying dirty syringes transferring droplets of infected blood from person to person. The reality is far more complex.When a mosquito bites and sucks up some blood that contains a virus, the virus quickly ends up in the gut of the insect.From there, the virus needs to infect the cells lining the gut and “escape” to infect the rest of the body of the mosquito, spreading to the legs, wings, and head.After being sucked up in blood, the virus ends up in the mosquito’s gut.ShutterstockThe virus then has to infect the salivary glands before being passed on by the mosquito when it next bites.This process can take a few days to over a week.But time isn’t the only barrier.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. ""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry,"" the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible.

In order to keep the coronavirus at bay, it’s important to disinfect your kitchen, bathrooms ― even the air ― sometimes multiple times per day. But with the recent panic-buying that’s wiped store shelves clean of commercial disinfectants, you might not have the usual products on hand.Fortunately, you can make DIY hand sanitizer, disinfecting spray and wipes. Here’s what you need to know about making your own cleaning products that kill the coronavirus.Advertisement

Items You’ll NeedThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting your home that are crucial to follow when making your own disinfectants. For example, the CDC says that it’s important to use EPA-registered disinfectants that have been vetted for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and allow enough contact time on the surface for the disinfectant to work.There are just a handful of solutions you need for DIY cleaning products, according to Dean Davies, cleaning supervisor for Fantastic Services, which specializes in antiviral sanitization.",vodka is not one of them,no

Last review completed on

Therapy Description
Activity of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 has been demostrated in vitro (Wang 2020), although it was found to be 100-fold less potent than remdesivir and chloroquine. This may suggest the challenge of narrow therapeutic window for ribavirin. A mouse study (Barnard 2006) of SARS-CoV-1 had demonstrated higher levels of virus in lungs in those treated with ribavirin compared to no treatment. Treatment with interferon-α2b and ribavirin in macaques infected with MERS-CoV (Falzarano 2013) showed benefit of this combination. Combination of LPV/r and ritonavir demonstrated synergy in vitro against SARS-CoV-1 and clinical benefit in patients treated with combination compare to ribavirin alone in historical controls (Chu 2004). Review (Stockman 2006) reported most human clinical studies were inconclusive and some showed harm of ribavirin in treating SARS-CoV-1.",Ribavirin,neutral

Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801/MK-4482), developed by Merck in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is one of the front-runners among investigational oral antivirals for the early, outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Molnupiravir is a ribonucleoside analog that inhibits replication in several RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Promising early results for molnupiravir from a phase II trial of 175 patients were presented at this year's Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Data showed that among participants with early SARS-CoV-2 infection, no infectious virus could be cultured from nose swabs taken 5 days after taking molnupiravir. In comparison, 24% of participants who received placebo still had infectious virus on nose swabs at day 5 (P=0.001).",inhibits replication in several RNA viruses,neutral

In the control group, participants took lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours, also for 14 days. Combination may ‘rapidly suppress’ virusThe results revealed that the three-drug combination was safe and more efficient than lopinavir-ritonavir in relieving COVID-19 symptoms, reducing the period of viral shedding, and shortening the length of hospital stays. Specifically, nasopharyngeal swabs showed that the average time before the virus cleared was 7 days in the combination group, compared with 12 days in the control group. Side effects across both groups included nausea — which resolved with no intervention — and diarrhea, with no difference between the two groups. “Our trial demonstrates that early treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with a triple combination of antiviral drugs may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body, relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk to healthcare workers by reducing the duration and quantity of viral shedding (when the virus is detectable and potentially transmissible).” — Lead researcher Prof. Kwok-Yung Yuen, University of Hong Kong “Furthermore, the treatment combination appeared safe and well-tolerated,” adds Prof. Yuen.Trial strengths and limitationsHowever, Prof. Yuen also warns that “[d]espite these encouraging findings, we must confirm in larger phase III trials that interferon beta-1b alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in patients with more severe illness (in whom the virus has had more time to replicate).” Dr. Jenny Lo, from Ruttonjee Hospital in Hong Kong, echoes this sentiment.",relieving COVID-19 symptoms,neutral

Still, they have not been thoroughly tested in humans. More research is needed.The bottom lineMany supplements on the market may help improve immune health. Zinc, elderberry, and vitamins C and D are just some of the substances that have been researched for their immune-enhancing potential.However, although these supplements may offer a small benefit for immune health, they should not and cannot be used as a replacement for a healthy lifestyle.Aiming to eat a nutrient-dense balanced diet, getting enough sleep, engaging in regular physical activity, and not smoking (or considering quitting, if you smoke) are some of the most important ways to help keep your immune system healthy and reduce your chances of infection and disease. If you decide that you want to try a supplement, speak with a healthcare professional first, as some supplements may interact with certain medications or are inappropriate for some people.Moreover, remember that there’s no scientific evidence to suggest that any of them can protect against COVID-19 — even though some of them may have antiviral properties.

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy

The idea is that alkalizing your body (by drinking juice or lemon water, which is acidic in its natural state) creates a less appealing environment for the novel coronavirus. But, unfortunately, the logic is wrong. According to WebMD, there’s no evidence that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or any other means does anything for coronavirus. In fact, it’s even contrary to medical science.

The virus cannot simply be washed away by drinking water or gargling liquid regularly. While it can enter the body through the nose and mouth in tiny droplets coughed out by other people who are infected, it primarily tends to infect cells of the respiratory tract.
