These can help make daily walking activities easier and reduce irritation in your calf muscles when you return to sports with running and jumping movements.

Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.orthomed.ca/blog/what-is-the-best-ankle-brace-for-me.html," Physical therapy and massage that promote gently stretching (and later strengthening) of your calf muscles can be beneficial.

There are many ankle supports designed specifically for Achilles Tendonitis to counteract irritation to the tendon, through support and compression. For more severe issues (and following surgery) a rigid boot with a 'wedge' can be used to keep the ankle in a slightly flexed (foot pointed down) position to protect the tendon from overstretching while it heals.

No matter how much stretching or preparation you do before a casual jog or a race, even expert runners can find themselves battling pain and injuries, especially ones affecting the feet and lower legs. Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, and ankle sprains are all extremely common for runners—but luckily, there’s gear that can help both prevent injuries and relieve pain in these areas. Consider where you’re looking for more support, or where previous injuries have flared up. Compression socks and sleeves are best for preventing swelling and for post-run recovery, while a sturdier ankle brace is best for running after an ankle sprain or twist. While these products may appear similar at first glance, subtle tweaks make all the difference.",there’s gear that can help both prevent injuries and relieve pain,neutral,"

If your child is really uncomfortable (so that he can't sleep, for example) and his fever is 103 degrees or higher, then I'd suggest you give him the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring his fever down so that he — and you — can rest. If fever-reducing medication isn't a good option for your child — because he's allergic to the medicine or doesn't take medicine very well, or you'd rather not give him any — a lukewarm bath or sponge bath won't hurt him, and it may help reduce his temperature. (Bathing a child with a fever was a common practice before these fever reducers were available.) Just make sure that the water is lukewarm to warm, not cool, because shivering can actually raise your child's temperature rather than help bring it down.

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://pathwayshealth.org/hospice-topics/folic-acid-and-memory-loss-what-you-should-know/," Folate has been found to protect against some cancers, prevent heart disorders and stroke, build muscle mass, form hemoglobin, and reduce the impact of mental and emotional disorders, says Improve Memory. Perhaps most interestingly, folic acid is also thought to slow down age-related memory and cognitive decline.Folate (vitamin B-9) is vital for red blood cell formation as well as for healthy cell function and growth, points out the Mayo Clinic. You can get folic acid through a multivitamin or by eating dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans, and peas, as well as fruits such as lemons, oranges, bananas, strawberries, and melons. While studies are still being done, preliminary research suggests that dementia and Alzheimer’s disease could be linked to low folate levels and high homocysteine levels.Low folate and high homocysteine concentrations have been associated with poor cognitive performance. One study showed high doses of folic acid administered to healthy people between 50 and 75 resulted in memory test scores similar to those five years younger, with cognitive speed scores similar to those two years younger. Researchers say this represents a significant level of brain protection due in part to the presence of folate.Facts About FolateFolic acid, a B vitamin used by the body to manufacture DNA, is necessary for rapid cell division and organ and tissue formation in developing babies.The recommended daily intake of folate for adults is 400 micrograms.Folic acid-rich foods include fortified breakfast cereals, bread, rice, pasta, orange juice; green vegetables, and legumes such as kidney, navy, lentil and garbanzo beans.Folic acid intake is thought to lower risks related to stroke, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer.Folate-deficiency anemia, the lack of folic acid in the blood, results in low levels of folate.",low folate levels and high homocysteine levels,neutral,"

Edward Reynolds draws together the evidenceFolic acid is important for functioning of the nervous system at all ages.1–4 In the fetus the relation between maternal folate status and the risk of neural tube defects is well established: clinical trials have shown that periconceptual preventive treatment with 400 μg or higher of folic acid significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism are associated with a variety of overlapping syndromes which are influenced by age of clinical presentation. These include developmental delay, cognitive deterioration, motor and gait abnormalities, behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, seizures, signs of demyelination or failure of myelination, and vascular changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging or postmortem examination.4 Less commonly, subacute combined degeneration and peripheral neuropathy may also occur.In adult patients presenting with megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, approximately two thirds have neuropsychiatric disorders which overlap considerably with those associated with anaemia due to vitamin B-12 deficiency.2,5 However, depression is commoner in patients with folate deficiency, and subacute combined degeneration with peripheral neuropathy is more frequent in those with vitamin B-12 deficiency. The degree of anaemia is poorly correlated with the presence of neuropsychiatric disorders, but if these anaemias were left untreated nearly all patients would eventually develop neuropsychiatric complications.2 Over the past 35 years numerous studies have shown a high incidence of folate deficiency correlated with mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline in epileptic, neurological, psychiatric, geriatric, and psychogeriatric populations.3,4 Furthermore, recent studies in elderly people suggest a link between folic acid, homocysteine, ageing, depression, and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease.4,6–9In this paper I review the evidence relating folate deficiency to depression and dementia, especially in the ageing nervous system. Summary pointsFolate deficiency is associated with depression and dementiaIn elderly people it may be related to ageing, poor diet, malabsorption, drugs, or increased demand or be unexplainedFolic acid has particular effects on mood and cognitive and social functionImpaired folate metabolism may result in a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that resembles ageingThe duration of folate deficiency and of its treatment is as important as the degree of deficiency and the dose of folic acidFolic acid should be used with caution in the presence of vitamin B-12 deficiency or epilepsyFolic acid is important in the nervous system at all ages, but in elderly people deficiency contributes to ageing brain processes, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and, if critically severe, can lead to a reversible dementiaPatients with epilepsyMany studies of folate in serum, red cells, or cerebrospinal fluid have shown a consistent association between drug induced deficiency and mental changes, especially depression, apathy, psychomotor retardation and dementia.3,4Treatment of 26 folate deficient epileptic patients with 5 mg of folic acid daily for one to three years resulted in improved drive, initiative, alertness, concentration, mood, and sociability in most.1 This contradicted the prevailing view that folic acid was harmful only to the nervous system, although that concept was reinforced by the additional observation that seizure control deteriorated in several of the patients.",BMJIt is becoming clear that folic acid affects mood and cognitive function,neutral,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37486," Neuropsychological tests were administered, and folate, homocysteine, vitamin B12, IL-6, TNF-α, Aβ-42, and Aβ-40 were measured at baseline and at 6- and 12-month time points.152 participants (folic acid: 77, conventional: 75) completed the trial. Significant improvements in folate (ηp2 = 0.703, P = 0.011), homocysteine (ηp2 = 0.644, P = 0.009), Aβ-42 (ηp2 = 0.687, P = 0.013), peripheral IL-6 (ηp2 = 0.477, P = 0.025), TNF-α (ηp2 = 0.709, P = 0.009) levels were observed in folic acid group compared with conventional group.

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/low-folate-levels-associated-with-dementia-and-mortality," The rates of death from any cause came in just under 8%.The participants without the deficiency experienced rates of dementia of 3.2%, and the all-cause death rates amounted to almost 4%.After factoring in co-occurring conditions, such as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, cognitive decline, and depression, the researchers associated folate deficiency with a 68% higher risk of a dementia diagnosis.The participants with folate deficiency had three times the risk of dying from any cause.A fresh lookAnat Rotstein, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, was the study’s lead author.In an interview with Medical News Today, Dr. Rotstein discussed the significance of this work:“This study is important because it critically characterizes the association between a widely used and simple-to-measure biomarker serum folate (vitamin B9 in the blood) and the risks of dementia and all-cause mortality.”“It is the first study of serum folate and the risk of dementia to consider two key methodological artifacts: mortality precludes dementia, and reverse causation,” she continued.“Hence, our study provides the best evidence to date regarding the association between serum folate deficiency and all-cause mortality.”David A. Merrill, M.D., Ph.D., is an adult and geriatric psychiatrist and director of the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Pacific Brain Health Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.In an interview with MNT, Dr. Merrill described this study as “newsworthy,” because the role of folate in cognitive health is not well established.He also noted that testing for folate levels “could be helpful […] more as a screening tool” since “deficiencies are associated with symptoms.”Reverse causationDr. Rotstein and her team also investigated the possibility that low folate levels could arise from, not before, preclinical dementia. This is hard to rule out due to the time it takes for cognitive decline to manifest.When the researchers categorized their data by the length of the monitoring period, they could not eliminate the potential role of reverse causation.Dr. Rotstein told MNT, “Our results show moderate evidence for reverse causation in dementia, suggesting that serum folate deficiency may be a consequence of the onset of dementia rather than its cause (not so with all-cause mortality).”If dementia is responsible for the drop in serum folate, it may be a useful marker to help doctors identify people with an increased risk of dementia.The study’s limitationsThe researchers acknowledge that their study has several limitations.Firstly, it only included individuals ages 60–75 years who were chosen to undergo screening for serum folate concentrations. A random sample may have produced more accurate estimates for a broader population.Due to the observational study design, the authors could not confirm that low folate levels cause dementia or early death.Further, serum folate concentrations may not reflect long-term folate levels, because they change with metabolism and food intake.Also, the study did not account for possible undetected genetic risk factors.Public health implicationsThe study’s authors conclude that healthcare professionals should “treat deficiency for [preventive] measures and/or as part of implemented therapeutic strategies while regularly reviewing patients’ clinical outcomes.”Dr. Rotstein was hesitant to recommend regular testing for individuals outside of the study’s age range of 60–75 years.However, Dr. Merrill felt that yearly or biannual testing may be helpful for people with a family history of dementia or approaching middle and later life.The cost-effectiveness of testing is questionable, though, as Dr. Merrill remarked: “You would get arguments on either side.",If dementia is responsible for the drop in serum folate,neutral,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661198/full," Folate deficiency and possible deficiency are defined when the level of plasma/serum folate is <6.8 nmol/L and 13.5 nmol/L, respectively (WHO, 2015). Previous studies showed that low folate level is not only associated with specific domains of cognitive functioning, e.g., episodic recall and recognition (Wahlin et al., 1996; Hassing et al., 1999; Nurk et al., 2005; De Lau et al., 2007), but also associated with all types of dementia, including vascular dementia and AD (Clarke et al., 1998; Ebly et al., 1998; Morris, 2003; Zhuo et al., 2011; Douaud et al., 2013; Cascalheira et al., 2015). In addition, folate/folic acid supplementation is beneficial to the improvement of cognitive functions in aged subjects and cases of mild cognitive impairment (Fioravanti et al., 1997; Morris, 2003; Durga et al., 2007; De Jager et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2019). Moreover, deprivation of folate increases tau phosphorylation, the major component of neurofibrillary tangles (Chan and Shea, 2006). However, there has not been a meta-analysis study to investigate the association between folate deficiency/possible deficiency and the risk of AD, as well as the benefical effect of sufficient folate intake on the prevention of AD. This study aims to investigate the role of folate deficiency/possible deficiency in the risk of AD and the benefical effect of sufficient folate intake on the prevention of AD in addition to updating the association between plasma/serum folate levels and AD.",supplementation,neutral,"

Can Folic Acid Improve Cognitive Function? Folic acid has be used to treat people suffering from memory loss, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia for some time now. There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:

In this context, we selected individuals suffering from MCI and utilized a folic acid intervention to attenuate inflammation, as we believe this treatment would be a feasible public health strategy for preventing dementia.”​They concluded that folic acid has significant anti-inflammatory and memory-enhancing properties.“Supplementing the subjects’ diets with 400mg of folic acid daily for twelve months significantly improved their cognitive performance and reduced systemic inflammation. ​“Cognitive improvement resulting from folic acid supplementation depends on regulating the peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels. Folic acid is a promising treatment for individuals with mild cognitive impairment,” they added.​Source: Scientific Reports​doi:  10.1038/srep37486​“Folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function by reducing the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines in elderly Chinese subjects with MCI”.​Authors: Fej Ma, et al​.

Introduction
Recently, due to the improvement of medical services and healthcare coverage, the number of elderly people has increased globally alongside the increment in life expectancy. The incidences of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, ischemia, and stroke, have proportionally increased. One of these diseases is vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), which refers to all forms of cognitive disorders associated with cerebrovascular disease that result in a wide range of cognitive deficits (Dichgans and Leys 2017).",The change of cognitive function is not effectively shown,neutral,"

Eight years after the study ended, though, the men had a small decrease in their risk of cognitive impairment, though it was not a significant change.Certain people taking the supplements in the new long-term study did experience some small positive effects. One analysis of the data found that people with low blood levels of holotranscobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, improved their thinking speed with the vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements.“This agrees with the entire clinical picture of B12-related to memory trouble,” said Zwerling.The supplements given to both groups in the new study also included 15 micrograms of vitamin D3, which may improve brain function at high levels. It is possible that vitamin D3 diluted the effects of the other supplements on mental performance, although it could have simply eliminated any vitamin D3 deficiency among the participants.“Individuals, especially the elderly, differ in their metabolism of vitamin D and susceptibility to vitamin D deficiency,” said Zwerling. “Overall, the use of D3 just ‘evened the playing ground’ in a population known to have high rates of deficiency.”Although this new study failed to demonstrate the mental benefits of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements, vitamin B12 remains essential for overall health.Find Out: What Causes Dementia?",failed to demonstrate the mental benefits of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements,no,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/25/2/63," The highest folate deficiency rates in the population occur among older adults, with estimated prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 20%.2 3 Evidence suggests that serum folate deficiency increases the likelihood of deficits in cognitive performance and neurological functioning.4 This situates serum folate as a possible biomarker positioned to modify the risk of dementia.5 However, the few observational studies that have examined the association between serum folate deficiency and the risk of dementia have shown inconsistent results.6–11 In total, four studies have shown low serum concentrations of folate/serum folate deficiency to be associated with an increased risk of dementia,6 7 9 11 and two studies have shown a null association.8 10 With one exception,10 all studies comprised of small sample sizes,6–9 11 and no study of the association between folate deficiency and the risk of dementia has considered that mortality precludes dementia, a bias that is appropriate to account for in studies of older adults.12
Folate deficiency is associated with an elevated risk of premature mortality in the general adult population.13 Despite the increased rate of folate deficiency in older adults,1 few observational studies have scrutinised the association between serum concentrations of folate and the risk of mortality, focusing on this population segment.14 In a large population-based cohort study, serum folate deficiency was associated with an increased risk of mortality in old age,15 whereas most small-scale survey-based longitudinal studies have yielded null results.14
Prior studies of the associations between serum concentrations of folate and the risks of incident dementia or all-cause mortality have been unable to directly exclude the possibility that such associations are a by-product of reverse causation. Reverse causation has been demonstrated to be particularly relevant to studies of dementia,16 because the neuropathological processes of dementia may start decades before a formal diagnosis is given.17 Thus, plausibly, serum folate deficiency is a consequence of preclinical dementia rather than its cause.ObjectiveThe current study aims to examine the association between serum folate deficiency and the risks of incident dementia and all-cause mortality in a large national sample of older adults, and to scrutinize reverse causation .MethodsPopulation and study designThe current study data are derived from electronic health records (EHRs) held at ‘Meuhedet Healthcare Services’ (hereafter Meuhedet), which provides healthcare services with national coverage to 14% of the total population of Israel as detailed elsewhere.18
A prospective birth cohort study design was applied (online supplemental figure 1). The eligible sample consisted of Israeli citizens from across the nation, aged 60–75 years in 2013, without pre-existing dementia (either a previous diagnosis or medication for dementia) for at least 10 years before serum folate measurements began. Individuals with pre-existing dementia were excluded from this study. All study participants were selected by their physician to be screened for serum concentrations of folate and had a least one serum folate blood test reported.Supplemental material

Several reports suggest a higher prevalence of various psychiatric disorders in elderly patients with folate deficiency. There is interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. Four trials met the criteria for inclusion and three provided enough data for analysing. It was not possible to pool the data because the trials studied different populations and tested folic acid in different doses, and in one trial in conjunction with B12. The analysis showed no significant beneficial effect of folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, over placebo on any measure of cognition or mood in healthy, cognitively impaired, or demented older people.",improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia,neutral,"

One possibility was mentioned above, folic acid supplementation and lower Hcy levels can improve MS activity and D4 dopamine receptor-mediated PLM, which were proposed to play a central role in attention and cognition [46]. Another possibility is that folate deficiency is one of the risk factors for depression [27]. Mood improvement may be beneficial for cognitive function. Other possibilities are as follows: practice effects or placebo effects. Another possibility is that because this study was performed at a dementia clinic, the doctor and health care providers provided other forms of care to stimulate brain function, including better daily living, such as a regular lifestyle, regular meals, reading newspapers and participating in social activities, which may have influenced the improvement in the MMSE score.",folic acid supplementation and lower Hcy levels can improve MS activity,neutral,"

The limited evidence from the short-duration randomized controlled trials suggests that supplementation with vitamins B6 or B12 or folic acid among either elderly cognitively intact individuals or those with dementia or cognitive impairment does not improve cognitive function as measured by a wide battery of tests. The 1 exception to this may be folic acid supplementation in people with both cognitive impairment and serum folate levels lower than 3 ng/mL (<6.8 nmol/L). However, any conclusions about the effect of folic acid treatment are greatly limited because there are only 3 trials with 39 people who received folic acid. Further clarification may be available soon because a large, 3-year trial of folic acid in elderly people with hyperhomocysteinemia has been presented at an international conference.52 The abstract, which has not yet been peer reviewed, preliminarily reported a net improvement in global cognitive function including memory, sensorimotor speed, and informational processing speed. Notably, in a minority of studies of both vitamin B12 and combinations of B vitamins that include vitamin B12 compared with placebo, the B vitamin treatment resulted in worse performance on a small number of cognitive tests. The clinical significance of this effect, though, is questionable, in that those receiving placebo had statistically significant improvements from baseline among these tests.",does not improve cognitive function,no,"

Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are a common problem among patients who present in family physicians' offices. Although a significant number of warts will spontaneously resolve over two years, patients frequently request treatment to clear their skin of the lesions. Treatments such as cryotherapy, acid preparations, laser therapy, heat, and tape occlusion have been used in the management of warts, with cure rates ranging from 32 to 93 percent. However, most of these therapies are expensive, painful, or labor intensive.","most of these therapies are expensive, painful, or labor intensive",neutral,"

Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy for Wart removal 
Find Clinics offering Wart Removal in London & UK »

  Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy (DTOT) is a wart treatment that is easy to perform at home, which is why many people are interested in using it. If you are curious about DTOT then this article will answer some of your questions about the treatment. What is DTOT (Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy)? DTOT is basically a regime of applying a piece of duct tape on top of warts, usually for about 6 days, before taking that bit of duct tape off to remove dead wart cells by means of a pumice stone or other similar tool. This regime needs to be repeated until the wart is completely removed, and you can expect DTOT to take up to and around 2 months to get rid of a wart.Does Duct Tape Occlusion Therapy work?

      The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter.",folic acid,neutral,"

But this doesn’t mean that their low vitamin D caused, or is even affecting, their vitiligo, and supplementing their vitamin D may be a good idea for their overall health, but is unlikely to help their vitiligo. Some have heard that vitiligo is partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in melanocytes, you can read more about that here. So some believe that taking antioxidants should help the disease, and many dermatologists recommend this for their patients. However it is important to remember that no matter how much things seem to make sense, we can’t know for sure if this approach will help vitiligo until they’re tested in clinical trials. Another example is supplementing vitamin B12 – this vitamin is more commonly deficient in vitiligo patients compared to the general population.",until they’re tested in clinical trials,neutral,"

For example, researchers have identified a significantly higher rate of B12 deficiency in some people with vitiligo, along with thyroid dysfunction and diabetes. It can be challenging to identify a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Currently, no vitamin deficiencies are known to be the sole cause of vitiligo. Despite this finding, studies have not consistently found a benefit of taking B12 or folic acid in those who do not have a deficiency.

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://www.cureus.com/articles/110638-diet-and-vitiligo-the-story-so-far," However, the correlation between diet diversity and immune-mediated skin diseases is still up to interpretation. Several supplements have been studied, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. Most studies agree that combining vitamin B12, folic acid, and sun exposure is good for inducing repigmentation. Supplementation of zinc and phenylalanine when used in conjunction with topical steroids or UV-B (ultraviolet B) treatment shows therapeutic effects on vitiligo due to their role in the melanin synthesis pathway. Investigations conducted on herbal supplements have revealed that most of them contain antioxidants, which aid in repigmentation.

Six patients experienced complete re-pigmentation of their vitiliginous skin, while 64% noted that the vitiligo stopped advancing after treatment. The combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 combined with the sun exposure produced better re-pigmentation than sun exposure or the vitamins alone. ​
The recommendation is that the vitamin and ultraviolet light treatment should continue as long as the white areas continue to re-pigment. Since at least 3 to 6 months were required for re-pigmentation to occur, patience is required for those utilizing this therapy. ​

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://chromaderm.com.au/vitiligo-and-diet-lets-chew-on-some-facts/," Red blood cells require B12 for their development. So, people with pernicious anaemia end up with anaemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. While patients with vitiligo are more likely to have pernicious anaemia, B12 injections are only helpful if tests confirm pernicious anaemia and B12 deficiency.Many website and sources recommend vitamin D supplementation but this is only needed if vitamin D levels are found to be low. Those with skin of colour (pigmented skin types) need more sunlight exposure than white skin to make vitamin D and those with vitiligo are more likely to burn in the sun. For these reasons, it is a good idea to have your vitamin D checked and supplemented it if the levels are below normal.Research has shown that early in the disease process vitiligo may be partly due to increased reactive oxygen species in the pigment cell (melanocyte) and for this reason, some people will advocate taking anti-oxidants to “boost the immune system.” But vitiligo is not due to a ‘low’ or ‘poor immune system,” it is due to an immune system that is misbehaving! Having said this, there is one research paper that emerged from a European group suggesting that vitamin C, E and alpha lipoic acid may be helpful in the early stages of vitiligo but these patients were also treated with phototherapy (narrow band UVB 311nm).",more likely to burn in the sun,neutral,"

Vitamins and Supplements
Studies have shown that people with vitiligo are often deficient in certain vitamins, like folic acid, B12, copper and zinc. These, along with others like CoQ10, vitamin E, sometimes vitamin C and a high-quality multi-vitamin are prescribed by some doctors to help stabilize the immune system. Vitamins/supplements are generally used in combination with other treatments. Some studies have shown that folic acid, B-12, and sun exposure can help repigment the skin when used together.

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/591/htm," Increased fat intake has been associated with the onset of vitiligo [100]. The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has recently been tested in vitiligo, but in combination with phototherapy and other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, with superior benefit compared with placebo [101].As far as vitamins are concerned, the most studied are vitamin B12, vitamin E, and vitamin D. Vitamin B12 and folic acid are involved in DNA repair and methylation. Studies are conflicting regarding vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in vitiligo. Serum vitamin B12 levels in patients were found to be sometimes abnormally low and sometimes normal compared with unaffected patients [102]. In one experimental study, patients treated with a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid and sun exposure repigmented more than patients treated with sun exposure alone; in another study, vitamin B12 and folic acid combined with NB-UVB did not show greater repigmentation than phototherapy alone [103,104].The immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties of vitamin C have been extensively documented.

Does yoga improve the management of asthma?,https://www.everydayhealth.com/asthma-pictures/great-yoga-poses-for-asthma-relief.aspx," A review of 15 studies published in April 2016 in the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews looked at the effect of yoga in patients with asthma, finding that yoga “probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.”“There can be outside forces, such as allergens and toxins, that may trigger an asthma attack,” says Bar. “While we can’t always necessarily avoid some triggers, we can use yoga to try to generally stay calm and have breath and body awareness, and that may be able to at least take a layer off the severity of the attack, if not help prevent it.”Doing yoga routinely can have a cumulative effect, says Bar. If you begin to feel an asthma attack coming on, you can use breath awareness, says Bar, to slow down and remain calm. During an asthma attack, Bar adds, we use any muscles we can to try to breathe, and as a result, our muscles get very tight; stretching the shoulders, back, side, and breathing muscles routinely is great conditioning for getting those muscles in the habit of relaxing in the event of an asthma attack. “You can do a relaxation pose every day and do one or two of the body stretches daily,” says Bar. “It won’t take very long.” And best of all, there are secondary benefits of yoga, such as a feeling of peace, increased mobility, better flexibility, and improved balance, says Bar.Simply put, yoga may help provide some asthma relief, and can lead to a host of other health benefits.",probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma,neutral,"

It was found that one preliminary study of yoga therapy for asthma on 46 patients data clearly shows a significant qualitative improvement in the severity and duration of attacks; attacks per week and decrease medication use (19).Significant symptomatic improvement after yoga training for 9 months in patients with chronic severe airways obstruction was observed in Australia. A decade ago both short and long-term prospective studies in India showed clearly the beneficial effects of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma (20). A study showed significant effect with in short time (13 days) of yoga practice (21).Since bronchial asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in resource limited areas where the long term use of multiple drugs is costly, it is wise to think alternative way to treat such an illness with better economic safety and avoid adverse effect of the drugs. The study therefore tries to look into the applicability of yoga as an alternative approach in the treatment of asthma in Ethiopia.

With the guidance of a yoga therapist, people with asthma can promote more effective breathing and develop their breath control through yogic breathing exercises. People with asthma often find their body has to work harder to breathe correctly, and they may develop more anxiety concerning their breath, which can exacerbate symptoms. Techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing can open airways, strengthen abdominal muscles and improve heart and lung function, potentially soothing asthma symptoms and making sufferers feel more in control. As stress is a trigger (and can exacerbate other triggers) of asthma attacks, yoga’s function of calming people’s nervous system and relieving panic can be extremely valuable for those living with asthma.

Maxims typically date back many years, but “feed a cold, starve a fever” may beat them all. This saying has been traced to a 1574 dictionary by John Withals, which noted that “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief is that eating food may help the body generate warmth during a “cold” and that avoiding food may help it cool down when overheated.

Is the old adage “feed a cold, starve a fever” true? NorthShore's Robert Mitchell Figura, D.O., puts to rest the truth of this ancient wisdom. The reason people say “feed a cold” is because the body needs energy when it's fighting illness. This applies to both colds and flu, but for different reasons. For a cold, eating healthy food will provide the body the extra energy it needs to fight illness, but can also help the body generate heat. The cold virus replicates faster in a cold environment so raising your body's temperature along with bundling up can stop cold germs in their tracks, said Dr. Figura.",true,neutral,"

True or False: “Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever”








 
The saying “feed a cold, starve a fever” dates back to a dictionary published by John Withals in 1574 because of a note that indicated “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief that has carried through the years is that the body needs food to generate warmth for healing from a cold – while avoiding food helps to cool the body when a fever is present. False: Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever
 
Even though this medical folklore has been carried through the years, should we still be abiding by these recommendations? We live in a modern world filled with vast information about health and wellness. Science has examined this tradition and found that it is an old wives’ tale. In the 1500s and 1600s, doctors thought that a fever meant that the metabolism was working in overdrive. So, the idea was the withholding food would help the body to cool since the digestive system doesn’t need to work to break down the food.",the digestive system doesn’t need to work to break down the food,no,"

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.safeandsoundhealth.co.uk/feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever/," If you have the appetite, it’s a good idea to keep eating and feed a cold or fever. As well as making sure that you’re eating well, you should stay hydrated while you’re ill. Unfortunately, you might not feel particularly hungry when you’re ill. Even though your body needs the calories, your appetite is suppressed so that your energy can be directed to your immune system. If you don’t feel much like eating, focus on staying hydrated and try to choose drinks with higher calories, rather than choose to starve a flu or any other illness.",If you have the appetite,no,"

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.healthline.com/health/feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever," Is it true?It’s not unusual to lose your appetite when you’re sick. At times, not eating seems to help, but sometimes it can make you feel that much weaker. So, should you really starve a fever? Not according to the medical experts at Cedars-Sinai, who call it fiction. Cold or flu, your immune system needs energy and nutrients to do its job, so eating and getting enough fluids is essential. Harvard Medical School agrees, saying that there’s no need to eat more or less than usual if you have a cold or flu.",call it fiction,no,"

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/health/feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever/index.html," Conversely, if someone was burning with fever, not eating was believed to “cool” the patient down. Thankfully, starving is no longer recommended for treating any sickness. Proper nutrition – and even more important, proper hydration – is crucial in preventing and recovering from both fevers and colds. We know that staying hydrated is a key factor in fighting infections. However, the amount of food we need when we’re sick may be different for children and adults. In children: Feed a cold, feed a fever

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.theraflu.com/treating-cold-flu/is-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever-true/," Learn more below. Busting the ‘Feed a Cold, Starve a Fever’ Myth
The first thing to note is that fever itself is not actually an illness, while a cold is. Colds are caused by viruses and may result in a number of unpleasant symptoms – including a stuffy nose, coughing, sore throat and, very occasionally, fever.1 A fever, however, can be a symptom of a cold, the flu or any kind of bacterial or viral infection.2,3
 
Colds and the Flu Need Fluids to Help Treat Them
One of the most important steps in helping to treat cold and flu symptoms, including fever, is to keep up your fluid intake to help prevent dehydration.1,4 This can be done by drinking water or other liquids, such as tea, broth or soup.4,5
And because your body needs fluids to support its recovery, ‘starving’ it of this essential hydration will do little to help treat the cause of your fever – and instead may even keep you from feeling better.5
 
Nutritious Foods Can Help to Support Your Immune System
Another reason not to act on the ‘feed a cold, starve a fever’ myth when you’re feeling ill is that certain foods can actually help to support our immune systems. A healthy and strong immune system can help to protect you from cold and flu viruses in the first place.6
Vitamin C is vital for immune function – as well as bone structure, iron absorption and healthy skin. But since our bodies don’t produce vitamin C naturally, we have to get it from either our diet or vitamin supplements. This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7
A nutritious diet that is high in fruits and vegetables is also one of the easiest ways to help support your immune system and general health – whether you have a cold, fever or neither – so it isn’t wise to starve your body of these foods at any time.8
















This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7









Feeding Colds and Fever – Listen to Your Body 
Ultimately, if you are suffering from a cold or a fever, it’s important to listen to your body when it comes to food.3
Since our immune systems do need nutrients, it’s a good idea to keep up some calorie intake when you’re not feeling well – if you have the appetite.",certain foods can actually help to support our immune systems,no,"

At least, that’s what this study found, but it only involved six participants, and – perhaps surprisingly – has never been properly followed up.",BodyShould,no,"

This, however, is a remedy of the past that should stay there. Starving is not recommended for treating any sickness. In fact, it can actually deprive your body of what it needs to fight off infection, delaying your recovery.﻿﻿


   Why It Doesn't Work  

When your body is combating a cold, it needs energy in the form of calories to fight off infection and recover. The same applies when you have a fever—and it may be even more important in that case.

Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2014/1101/p623.html," Practice Pointers




Oral contraceptives have long been known to be highly effective at suppressing the development of ovarian cysts. In one study, the relative risk of developing ovarian cysts was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.39) for women taking an oral contraceptive compared with those not taking an oral contraceptive.1 Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts, the authors sought to clarify whether this is appropriate. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Although the studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analyses for most questions, results from these studies were consistent enough to draw several conclusions. Five trials looked at spontaneously occurring ovarian cysts, representing a combined total of 398 women. The largest study included 141 women, and four of the studies were conducted in Turkey.",Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts,neutral,"

How can birth control prevent ovarian cysts from forming? Taking hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD, can be an effective method in preventing ovarian cysts from forming. Combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progesterone, are the most effective at blocking ovulation. The mini-pill, which contains only progestin, has an unpredictable effect on ovulation and is, therefore, less effective at preventing cysts from forming.

In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own. Authors' conclusions:

Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,https://www.fertilityjacksonville.com/why-is-birth-control-used-when-cyst-is-present/," The doctor is correct, that cysts don’t go away any faster while on birth control pills than if not on them at all. However, many physicians use them when a cyst is found. The reasoning for this is that while on the pill, the brain’s normal hormone production that stimulates the ovary gets placed on hold. This prevents the brain from trying to start an ovulation on top of the already present cysts. If this occurred, the new follicles could then be later confused with the previous cysts on ultrasound, thus complicating the picture. Also, when on a birth control pill, once that the cyst has resolved, the physician can then just stop the pill at that point and immediately start ovulation medication if needed.",cysts don’t go away any faster,neutral,"

        Abstract


BACKGROUND: 
Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. OBJECTIVES: 
This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. SEARCH STRATEGY: 
We searched the databases of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, and EMBASE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP).",birth control pills could be used to treat cysts,neutral,"

Studies of the implant that’s currently on the market (Nexplanon) suggest that cysts are less of an issue. Birth control has other benefits. There are other ways birth control can contribute to ovarian health too. The pill reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by at least 40%—and the longer you use it, the more it helps!

When you next see her after her surgery, she asks whether the cyst could grow back and what can be done to prevent future cyst formation. The answer is that she can begin taking BCPs. The same mechanism that ""quiets down ovarian function"" and suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis for contraception helps prevent cyst formation within the ovary. Combined contraceptives are recommended (unless estrogen is contraindicated) for women with recurrent symptomatic cysts, such as ruptured cysts or torsed cysts, and for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Monophasic preparations have been shown in some studies to prevent benign ovarian cysts more effectively than low-dose triphasic pills.",helps prevent cyst formation,neutral,"

Zinc deficiency can interfere with many metabolic processes when it occurs during infancy and childhood, a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high. [30] Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning.

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7043363/," There was no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits. Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition, studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of populations in impoverished areas, rather than focusing on micronutrient and or zinc supplementation in isolation, should be an urgent priority.Plain language summaryZinc supplementation for improving pregnancy and infant outcomeTaking zinc during pregnancy helps to slightly reduce preterm births, but does not prevent other problems such as low birthweight babies.Many women of childbearing age may have mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc concentrations may cause preterm birth or they may even prolong labour. It is also possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well. This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, involving over 17,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementation has a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does not help to prevent low birthweight babies compared with not giving zinc supplements before 27 weeks of pregnancy.

Most people who eat meat and have a reasonably well-balanced diet get plenty of zinc, and even if you're not already getting enough from your diet, your prenatal vitamin will most likely provide all the zinc you need. But if you eat a mostly vegetarian diet, you may have a hard time getting enough zinc from food alone. It's harder to absorb zinc from plant foods. Consider asking your healthcare provider whether you need a zinc supplement.

Finding ways to improve women's overall nutritional status, particularly in low-income areas, will do more to improve the health of mothers and babies than supplementing pregnant women with zinc alone. This should be an urgent research priority for the future. Authors' conclusions:

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/69/6/1257/4714990," In 2 studies, zinc was incorporated directly into the prenatal supplements (12, 14); of these studies, only one reported significant improvements in maternal serum zinc concentrations during pregnancy in zinc-supplemented women (14). The women in these studies (11–14), however, had higher intakes of zinc and iron than would be true for most women in developing countries. Because maternal needs for both zinc and iron during pregnancy appear to influence zinc absorption and metabolism (15), the relevance of these findings for women in developing countries is not clear.As part of a randomized trial of maternal zinc supplementation and pregnancy outcome and maternal and infant health, Peruvian women were randomly assigned to receive prenatal iron and folate supplements with or without zinc. Because Peruvian guidelines indicate universal prenatal iron supplementation, we could not directly assess the effect of iron supplementation on zinc status; however, we could examine whether adding zinc to prenatal iron and folate tablets improved the zinc status of these women during pregnancy and of their neonates at delivery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Between 1995 and 1997, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal zinc supplementation to improve maternal and infant health was conducted at the Hospital Materno Infantil “Cesar Lopez Silva” in Villa El Salvador, an impoverished shantytown in Lima, Peru.

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://kinfertility.com.au/blog/zinc-in-pregnancy," Adequate levels of zinc are needed to create new cells, particularly collagen and fibre-like tissues required for repairing damaged cells. On top of this, zinc's function of supporting immune cell activity is also needed to combat inflammation from a wound.Why is zinc important during pregnancy?Zinc plays such an important role in helping cells to grow and multiply and adequate levels of zinc are needed during periods of rapid growth like pregnancy.One study that examined the effect of zinc supplementation during pregnancy noted that many people of childbearing age may be experiencing mild to moderate zinc deficiency. Low zinc status may cause preterm birth and there is evidence to suggest zinc deficiency may actually prolong labour.Researchers also measured child development outcomes and noted that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well.The authors of this literature review found a small but significant reduction in preterm birth for the zinc supplemented group compared to the placebo group.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently published a report on zinc supplementation during pregnancy which highlighted that zinc is not stored in the body, so physiological needs must be met through dietary intake (including zinc supplements).The WHO report noted the importance of the mineral in many biological processes relating to pregnancy as it contributes to human growth and development, supporting the healthy growth of the foetal nervous system as well as the aforementioned immune-boosting role.Maternal zinc supplementation can help counteract any risks associated with maternal or gestational zinc deficiency, such as:Reduced fertilityFoetal neurological malformationsSlow or inhibited growth (small for gestational age)Congenital malformationsPostpartum haemorrhagePre-eclampsiaThe WHO report makes note of the fact that overall nutrition is important for maternal and infant health, so while taking a specific zinc supplement may not cause harm, it's best to keep the bigger picture in mind.When considering prenatal zinc supplementation, it is recommended pregnant women look for one that contains a range of nutrients to aim for an optimal pregnancy and infant outcome.This evidence-backed oral zinc supplementation is a safe and handy way of ensuring you are receiving your daily zinc supplementation, as well as many other nutrients required for maternal and infant health.How much zinc is safe in pregnancy?Current recommendations in Australia about dietary zinc intake advise that pregnant people need about 10 to 11mg of zinc per day. To put that into context, the recommended daily intake of zinc for a typical adult woman is around 8mg per day.So when aiming for an optimal pregnancy outcome, the additional amount required shouldn't be too difficult for the average person to consume.Additionally, it's important for pregnant people to keep their nutrition in mind after childbirth as well, as breastfeeding can affect zinc status and deplete normal zinc levels.Is too much zinc harmful?As with a lot of nutrition advice, the recommended daily intakes are based on that 'sweet spot' between too little and too much. Too much zinc can be harmful to pregnant people (as well as the greater population) and can lead to zinc toxicity.Symptoms of zinc toxicity may include:NauseaVomitingStomach pain/acheDiarrhoeaHeadachesIf high levels of zinc are consumed over a long period, this can result in chronic zinc toxicity, which can lead to low levels of high-density lipoprotein ('good' cholesterol), decreased immune function and copper deficiency.How much is 'too much' zinc?One way to think about the recommended daily intake (RDI) of a vitamin or mineral is that the RDI sits in the middle of a spectrum. On one end you have deficiency, and on the other you have toxicity.Toxicity occurs when a person exceeds what's known as the tolerable upper level (UL) — that is, the maximum amount consumed before it becomes harmful.For maternal zinc intakes, the tolerable upper level for zinc is 40mg across all adult populations.Is vitamin C and zinc safe during pregnancy?Both vitamin C and zinc are two of the many essential vitamins and minerals the body needs for optimum health but are especially important during pregnancy.These vitamins and minerals not only help foetal growth but support the immune system to support pregnancy outcomes for both the parent and the growing baby.",may not cause harm,neutral,"

WHO antenatal care recommendations for a positive pregnancy experience

12 August 2021
 | Guideline









Download (735.3 kB)





Overview 
Evidence from a systematic review on antenatal zinc supplementation was evaluated as part of the World
Health Organization (WHO) antenatal care (ANC) guideline development process in 2016, and the following
recommendation on zinc supplementation was made: “Zinc supplementation for pregnant women is only
recommended in the context of rigorous research.” The Guideline Development Group (GDG) made this
recommendation because it felt that the evidence on the intervention was incomplete and that more research
was necessary.Since the publication of the systematic review, four additional randomized controlled trials have been published;
therefore, in April 2019, the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG) prioritized the WHO recommendation on
antenatal zinc supplementation for updating.

About 65% of the subjects had good to excellent compliance, which was similar in both the groups. Fifty three percent of the babies were male, and the two groups had similar distributions of sex (p  =  0.29), place of delivery (p  =  0.99), and birth attendants (p  =  0.74).View this table:View inline

 Basic characteristics of mothers receiving zinc supplement and those receiving placebo

There was no significant difference in the birth weights (and other anthropometric data) of the zinc supplemented group compared with the placebo group (table 2). The effect of various potential confounders on birth weight was assessed by linear regression analysis including age, sex, serum zinc concentration, haemoglobin status, gestation at delivery, height, weight, and body mass index of mother, and education, dietary intake, and socioeconomic status of parents. Low body mass index and prematurity were significantly associated with birth weight when all other factors were taken into account (p  =  0.01), and low maternal education was associated but did not reach statistical significance (p  =  0.07).View this table:View inline

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/here-are-5-nutrients-that-can-help-women-get-pregnant," You’ll want to give your body the best possible chance by ensuring that you’re eating well.What vitamins and minerals aren’t on your radar but probably should be? Even more importantly, will you get everything you need from your standard prenatal supplement?Here are five vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that have been shown to aid in fertility.They’re also among the few that women may not be getting enough of — or know to take at all, nutritionists say.ZincA study from Pennsylvania State University presented last month at the American Physiological Society annual meeting concluded that zinc deficiency can have a negative effect on egg development.This study was conducted on mice and not humans, but James Hester, the study’s lead author and a graduate assistant in physiology at Penn State, said that recent research in his lab and others is showing that zinc is a “key regulator” of oocyte (egg cell) development.It plays a role in oocyte division, fertilization, DNA regulation, and embryo development.“Our latest project shows that the zinc requirement starts even earlier than we thought,” Hester told Healthline. “Women trying to get pregnant should absolutely think about zinc in their and their partner’s diet, but they should be thinking about their whole diet and other health factors as well. Zinc is only one important piece of the puzzle.”If you’re eating a healthy diet and taking a supplement, you’re unlikely to be zinc deficient, so you probably don’t need to be tested.“Micronutrient levels are certainly something to discuss with an OB-GYN though, especially if women have other risk factors like food insecurity, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, or an unusual diet or lifestyle,” Hester said.The recommended daily allowance for zinc is 8 milligrams per day for adult women and 12 milligrams per day during pregnancy and lactation.Hester notes that women trying to conceive can take the higher amount, but they should be cautious because too much zinc can interfere with copper absorption and metabolism.CholineCholine is a vitamin that 90 percent of Americans aren’t getting enough of. In fact, only 5 to 10 percent of pregnant women are meeting intake guidelines.“Choline is essential to promote health at all life stages but is particularly critical for brain health both early in life as the brain is forming and later in life to prevent cognitive decline,” said Elizabeth Shaw, a registered dietitian from California and co-author of “Fertility Foods Cookbook: 100+ Recipes to Nourish Your Body.”While choline is in a lot of foods — egg yolks, lima beans, and liver — it’s in small amounts.Shaw said a diet rich in meats, whole eggs, and green vegetables can help people receive adequate choline. The recommended daily intake for choline is 550 milligrams per day.“Not all prenatal vitamins contain choline,” Shaw told Healthline.She added that the American Medical Association recently announced that it supports evidence-based amounts of choline in all prenatal vitamins.Omega-3sDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is vital for infant brain and eye development.",you’re unlikely to be zinc deficient,neutral,"

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://imprylusa.com/nutrition/zinc-and-fertility/," Usually, people with a balanced and healthy diet have sufficient quantities of zinc and do not require supplements. Being aware of the power of zinc and how it impacts areas such as fertility is important and heightens awareness of the value of a nutritious diet. How Zinc Affects Fertility
In fertility, zinc regulates the hormone functions that ensure ovulation is regular and so helps conception.1 A woman is more likely to conceive if her monthly periods are regular. Zinc is also important for men as it helps with healthy sperm formation. It also supports the development of healthy epithelial tissue in the reproductive system which enables conception.2 Zinc deficiency in men results in a drop in sperm count and also lowers testosterone levels.3
Research shows that it is important to plan for pregnancy and ensure that the body is as healthy as possible prior to conception as zinc levels affect the egg in the very early days of cell development as it divides. Being aware of this issue helps prospective parents prepare ahead to create the best possible conditions for a pregnancy to occur.",do not require supplements,neutral,"

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://natural-fertility-info.com/zinc-fertility.html," If your doctor suspects a serious zinc depletion or you also suffer with fibroids, you may need to take as much as 30 mg to provide your body with the amount it needs. Just be sure to also take a multi-vitamin containing copper (especially if using a higher zinc dosage), since zinc can cause a copper deficiency in some people. Adding more zinc to your system may not guarantee a pregnancy, but it sure can help to ensure that you have all of the minerals your body needs to produce strong eggs and sperm and is prepared as best as it can be for the job of building a baby ahead.

Gholizadeh showed that high concentration of zinc in mother’s serum was directly associated with dietary intake zinc and supplement zinc. Hanachi indicated that the zinc deficiency in the latter third of pregnancy may suggest insufficient maternal nutrition [19]. There are no valid tools for measuring nutrition zinc adequacy. This evaluation is difficult because of the fact that all digested zinc is not consumed by the organism and its bioavailability may be affected by intestinal absorption or blood circulation. Intestinal absorption may be reduced by dietary antagonistic factors such as phytates, oxalates, tannins, and polyphenols, while circulating zinc may compete with copper and iron, depending on the amount of these elements in the bloodstream [20].",can promote positive outcomes of maternal and child health,neutral,"

Eczema is an itchy and red skin condition, which may affect 20% of people world wide at some time in their life. Though it may improve with age, there is no cure. Many children outgrow this disorder as they reach secondary school age. Constant itch makes life uncomfortable for those with this condition, no matter what age they are.Conventional medical treatments make life better for people; however, some people who do not see an adequate improvement in their eczema or fear side-effects of conventional medical products, turn to complementary alternatives to conventional medical treatment. This review is of two such products: evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (BO) taken orally (by mouth), which have been thought to have benefits for eczema.We included 27 studies, with 1596 adults and children from 12 countries.",have been thought to have benefits for eczema,neutral,"

Eczema is an itchy and, to some, an embarrassing skin ailment. Typical medial treatments like cortisone are less than ideal. So some people have turned to evening primrose oil, a remedy made from the seeds of a yellow wildlflower that are rich in the essential fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid. There's only problem: evening primrose oil doesn't seem to work. A review of studies that tested the effectiveness of evening primrose oil found that it offered no improvement of symptoms compared with placebos like olive oil or paraffin oil.",evening primrose oil doesn't seem to work,no,"

Overall, the researchers found that taking evening primrose or borage oil offered no clear improvement of eczema symptoms over placebos. Commonly used placebos included olive oil and paraffin oil. There was also no improvement in quality of life with the complementary therapies, although only two studies considered this measure. ""There is no evidence that taking either evening primrose or borage oil is of benefit to eczema sufferers,"" said lead researcher Joel Bamford of the University of Minnesota Medical School and Essentia Health System in Duluth, Minnesota, US.

Skin lesions were analysed before and after treatment which led researchers to conclude EPO may be effective in helping treat non-inflammatory atopic dermatitis. In agreement with Yoon, Senapati S et al in a study titled ‘Evening primrose oil is effective in atopic dermatitis: a randomized placebo-controlled trial’ published in the Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology, 2008 Sep-Oct;74(5):447-52, Senapati et al carried out this study for 5 months whereby they gave one group of participants a placebo every day and one group an EPO capsule. Clinical evaluations were before the study and every month thereafter for 5 months. Results showed that by the end of the study 96% of the participants that were given EPO showed significant skin improvement. On the other hand, other studies seem unconvinced, but the general consensus is that EPO has a positive impact upon the symptoms of eczema thereby helping to lessen symptoms such as dry, itchy, flaky or inflamed skin.",EPO has a positive impact upon the symptoms of eczema,yes,"

Optimal dosing standards and treatment regimens await clarification in adequately powered clinical trials. Evening primrose oil (EPO), is obtained by cold expression or solvent extraction from the seeds of the evening primrose plant (Oenothera biennis).1 Native to North and South America and now widespread throughout Europe and parts of Asia, this biennial plant is also known by the names tree primrose, sun cups, sundrops, king's cure-all, fever plant, evening star, and night willow-herb. Native Americans valued its mucilaginous stem and leaf juices as topical remedies to soothe cutaneous inflammations, whereas poultices of the plant were used to treat bruises and minor wounds.2 Internally, the leaves were used for gastrointestinal ailments and sore throats. Oral EPO is best known for its more recent use in the treatment of systemic diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture?,https://www.bauerfeind.com.au/blogs/ankle-injuries/broken-ankle," Slowly rebuild after an ankle fracture
If the ankle is broken, the joint shouldn’t bear any weight or strain for at least 6 weeks so the fracture can heal. As a result, the stabilising muscles weaken and are much less effective when it comes to rehab. Proper movement and exercise with a therapist in these 6 weeks is crucial to the long term recovery of the cartilage and ligaments. Using supports and ankle braces in the rehab and recovery period is the best practice for long-term health of the joint. Supports and orthoses provide stability and stimulation




















A brace provides support after the initial 6 week rest period.It ensures that the ankle joint receives the necessary stability after a fracture and is not overloaded.

There is minimal evidence supporting the use of functional bracing over cast immobilization to improve functional outcome, range of motion, swelling, or post-traumatic arthrosis after ankle fracture in the long term. The primary benefits of functional bracing are the potential to return to work earlier and bracing may facilitate activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing. In addition, there may be a decreased patient risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization. However, there is an increased risk of wound infection when using a brace after open reduction and internal fixation of an unstable ankle fracture.

Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture?,https://www.thepodiatrygroup.com/2021/05/28/the-benefits-of-using-an-ankle-brace/," Benefits Of An Ankle Brace
In general, an ankle brace keeps your foot and toes pointed forward and prevents inward rotation or twisting of the foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains (stretching and tearing of ligaments, tendons, and other soft tissue) occur with sudden twisting or rotation of the ankle joint as you step off a curb or stair, or run on a bumpy, uneven surface. When an ankle injury occurs, coaches, primary care physicians, orthopaedic specialists, and podiatrists often advise patients to wear ankle braces for joint support and to prevent further injury. Bracing also limits the development of scar tissue and arthritis and reduces both acute and chronic pain. An ankle brace is an adjunctive tool after casting, surgery, physical therapy, exercise, targeted training, and other kinds of medical interventions. Your podiatrist in South Texas may advise an ankle brace in these situations:

Ankle fracture
Hindfoot fracture
Ankle sprain and repeated ankle sprains
Ankle instability due to arthritis, sprains, and obesity
Poor balance
Dysfunctional gait, such as toeing in or repeated inward rotation of the ankle joint
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis

After experiencing an ankle injury, it is important to consider rehabilitation as part of your treatment plan.

During this time, she recommends wearing the brace anytime you’re on uneven terrain (like a hike or playing your sport) but you don’t need to wear it all day.

Straps – Hook and loop strap braces typically wrap around the ankle; take care to not make the brace too tight
Stirrups – Stirrup braces are designed to limit lateral motion, and are often prescribed as an alternative to a splint or boot
Lace Ups – Usually made of rigid materials to provide more stability; newer designs are often combined with Hook and loop straps to improve comfort
Hybrids – Combine different aspects of all of the above-mentioned braces for comfort and stability

Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-e-for-scars," In total, 90% reported either an allergic reaction or that the vitamin did not affect their scarring.However, the vitamin may benefit other skin conditions. For example, one 2015 study suggested that vitamin E may improve symptoms and quality of life for people with atopic dermatitis, or eczema.A 2016 review says that more research is required to investigate whether there is any value in using vitamin E to manage scar healing. At present, there is not enough evidence to recommend using vitamin E to diminish scars.Learn about which home remedies might help treat scars.Using vitamin E for scarsBased on the available evidence, it would seem that vitamin E does not reduce the appearance of scarring.However, moisturizing the skin can help prevent scars from forming during wound healing, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). As long as a person is not allergic to vitamin E, they can use a moisturizer that contains this ingredient. However, it is unclear if moisturizers containing vitamin E would offer special benefits.Anyone interested in using topical vitamin E oil or taking vitamin E supplements should speak to a healthcare provider before trying.Learn more about vitamin E oil here.Effective techniques for scar healingThere are other ways to reduce the appearance of scars that may be more effective than vitamin E. These include:Silicone sheetsHydrogel or silicone gel sheets are soft, flexible, self-adhesive dressings that a person can apply over scars to flatten and soften them.Silicone may hydrate the scar tissue and reduce the production of collagen fibers. This means that scars may develop flatter, softer, and paler than they would otherwise.The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom suggest using silicone sheets for 12 hours a day for at least 3 months.Learn more about scar tissue here.MassageScar massage is one of the most common treatments for scar management.",vitamin E does not reduce the appearance of scarring,no,"

Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2016-09-02/does-vitamin-e-improve-scars/7537890," One of the most popular is vitamin E, which is found in many skin creams. But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. ""People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not,"" Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it ""a proven scientific fact"" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also ""nonsense"", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. ""People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars,"" Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen.",vitamin E will not help scars,no,"

A research study from 2006 demonstrates that “Vitamin E can be applied topically and will have good penetration into deep dermal tissue. The article claims that its anti-antioxidant properties help stabilize cell membranes, including cells of the inflammatory process, and thus reduce the amounts of chemicals released by those cells.” Furthermore, Vitamin E is also praised for other things like its moisturising and soothing benefits, especially for delicate or damaged skin.

Age-old home remedies and skin care products have touted vitamin E‘s scar- and blemish-fading ability for decades, but the jury is still out in terms of its effectiveness. Numerous studies have found that topical vitamin E application does not fade scars, though some tests have shown that it does prevent extra scar tissue from forming over the wound and that ingesting the vitamin—which you can do by upping your intake of leafy greens, seeds and nuts—may bolster the healing process by encouraging red blood cell formation.

The authors suggested that magnesium may interfere with both neurogenic and vascular mechanisms of migraine and may hence be an effective prophylactic treatment. Other studies using SPECT have shown conflicting results (Ramadan et al., 1991; Ferrari et al., 1995; Olesen et al., 1982).Women with menstrually-related migraine (MRM) may be particularly prone to developing magnesium deficiency. A prospective study involving 270 women, 61 of whom had MRM, showed that 45% had ionized magnesium deficiency during MRM attacks, 15% during non- menstrual attacks, 14% during menstruation without migraine and 15% between menstruation without migraine (Mauskop et al., 2002). Serum ionized calcium/magnesium levels were elevated in MRM, with normal ionized calcium levels.Magnesium deficiency has also been found in paediatric migraine, with decreased levels of serum, RBC and mononuclear blood cell magnesium found in paediatric migraineurs with or without aura compared with patients with tension type headache and controls (Soriani et al., 1995; Mazzotta et al., 1999).

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/magnesium/," Because of its safety profile and the lack of serious side effects, magnesium is often chosen as a preventive strategy either alone or with other preventive medications. Magnesium has also been studied for the acute, as-needed treatment of severe, difficult-to-treat migraine. Magnesium sulfate given intravenously was most effective in those with a history of migraine with aura. In those without a history of aura, no difference was seen in immediate pain relief or nausea relief by magnesium. Still, there was less light and noise sensitivity after the infusion. Magnesium oxide, in tablet form, is inexpensive, does not require a prescription, and may be considered reasonable prevention in those who have a history of aura, menstrually related migraine, no health insurance, or who may become pregnant.",may be considered reasonable prevention,neutral,"

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://www.withcove.com/learn/magnesium-migraine-prevention," Migraine sufferers are especially likely to be lacking in magnesium.Can magnesium help prevent migraine attacks?According to multiple scientific studies, the American Headache Society, and the American Academy of Neurology, the answer is yes. Not every clinical trial has shown magnesium to be effective at preventing migraine headaches, but there’s enough evidence that it helps that it’s a good option to consider.How can it help? Experts think magnesium may help prevent the wave of brain signaling, called a cortical spreading depression, that is thought to cause migraine. It can also reduce pain during an attack by blocking pain-transmitting chemicals in the brain.Research suggests that it’s especially helpful for people who have migraine with aura or menstrual migraine.

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.653765/full," Dairy foods, soy products, grains, seafood, and fortified foods are good dietary sources of calcium (44). The biological mechanisms between dietary calcium and magnesium intake and migraine were not fully understood but may be related to the following mechanisms. Magnesium may prevent migraine by inhibiting neuronal overexcitation, counteracting vasospasm, and reducing the formation of inflammatory mediators, as well as improving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, serotonin receptor transmission, and the NO system (12–14). Calcium and magnesium, which are involved in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators, may work together to help the nervous system function properly and relieve nerve tension (10, 11). Our results support the positive role of magnesium and calcium in migraine, the only difference being that we did not find an effect of magnesium on migraine in men. We speculate that this might be due to significantly higher ionized magnesium levels in the muscles of men than in women (45).",Magnesium may prevent migraine,yes,"

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun. When it’s possible, go outside with a friend, connect, and enjoy the weather.","If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin",neutral,"

Does exercise help manage diabetes?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-exercise-when-you-have-diabetes," Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:

Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes. Resistance training and aerobic exercise both helped to lower insulin resistance in previously sedentary older adults with abdominal obesity at risk for diabetes.",exercise lowers blood glucose levels,neutral,"

Ideally, weekly exercise would be spread over at least three days, with no more than two days passing without some form of activity. For those engaging in high-intensity exercise, shorter durations of 75 minutes per week may be sufficient.RELATED: What Updated Exercise Guidelines Mean for People With DiabetesAnd importantly, weekly workouts should include resistance, or strength, training at least two or three days, preferably on nonconsecutive days.

It increases insulin sensitivity, which helps the cells use any available insulin to take up glucose from the blood. Also, when muscle cells contract during exercise, they are able to take in glucose even when insulin is unavailable. The blood glucose-lowering effects of exercise last up to about 24 hours following a workout.Although all exercise helps counter the effects of diabetes by promoting weight loss and increasing insulin sensitivity, the specific types below provide additional advantages:Aerobic exercise: Regular aerobic training lowers blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and A1C test results, which provide the average blood glucose level of the past 2–3 months. Research has linked moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise to substantially lower cardiovascular and overall death risks in people with diabetes.Resistance exercise: Diabetes is a risk factor for poor muscle strength.

People who suffer from diabetes are commonly told that the key to improved diabetes control involves lifestyle changes, including a regular exercise routine. However, it’s not always clear how and why exercise plays such a crucial role. The word “exercise” can be intimidating, but it does not have to mean running a marathon or bench pressing your body weight. Exercise is simply getting physically active and increasing your heart rate. This can include marathon running, but it also includes walking, biking, gardening, climbing stairs, chair exercises, stretch-band exercises, Zumba, yoga, etc. If you are not ready to run that marathon, the term “physical activity” might be more comfortable.",not always clear how and why exercise plays such a crucial role,neutral,"

Does exercise help manage diabetes?,https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/fitness," Studies show that diet and exercise can sharply lower the likelihood of diabetes, even in people at high risk of developing it.Other studies show that lifestyle interventions such as diet, exercise, and education can improve risk factors that are often associated with cardiovascular disease in individuals already living with type 2 diabetes, as well as help lower blood sugar levels. So not only does eating a nutritious diet and getting enough physical activity help manage blood sugar if you already have type 2 diabetes, but it can also aid in weight loss and high cholesterol — issues often closely tied to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Also, a major clinical study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases observed individuals at risk for diabetes for three years and found that including 150 minutes of exercise a week decreased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. This means sticking to physical activity and a nutritious diet may not only help you avoid or reverse a type 2 diabetes diagnosis now but in the future as well.Exercise: Begin with the basicsWhile diet can sometimes be tailored for you by a doctor or nutritionist (i.e., you can’t tolerate gluten, you prefer low carb, if you are a vegan, etc. ), the kind of exercise that works for evading or managing type 2 diabetes is a bit broader.Essentially: All exercise counts! Especially because doing something you enjoy helps you to stick with it. According to the American Heart Association, most adults need at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both.For instance, you could choose to go on two 30-minute powerwalks 2 days out of the week, combined with two 20-minute runs 2 other days of the week.Keep in mind: Moderate aerobic exercise elevates your heart rate, so if it’s possible for you, make sure those powerwalks are brisk!If moderate exercise isn’t possible, the American Diabetes Association says that even low-volume activity (expending just 400 kcal/week) improves insulin action in previously sedentary adults.",evading or managing type 2 diabetes,neutral,"

Depending on the type of activity you do, it may cause your blood glucose levels to rise (hyperglycaemia) or drop (hypoglycaemia).Moderate exercise that lasts a while, like walking or cycling, can cause a slow drop in blood glucose levels.Some exercise, like running or football, might cause your blood glucose levels to rise.There are things you can do to help you manage your blood glucose levels.You can avoid hypos by eating the right amount of carbs before, during and after exercise.You should adjust your insulin and check your blood glucose regularly. Your diabetes team can help.Exercise affects everyone differently and it might take a little while to find out what works for you. But try to stick with it.Exercise is not only good for your physical and mental health, it also helps reduce glucose spikes after meals.As a general rule:check your blood glucose level before and during exercise – this'll help you work out what you should eat and when to adjust your insulinrecord your blood glucose levels and what you eat when you exercise – share this with your diabetes team to help find what works for youcheck your blood glucose levels regularly after exercise (they can drop up to 12 hours after exercise) – you may need to take extra carbohydrate or a lower dose of insulin before bedif you exercise, it's likely you'll need extra carbohydrate to prevent hyposdrink plenty of water while you exercise

requires maintaining regular exercise, proper meal planning and taking diabetes medications as prescribed. Maintaining regular weekly exercise and physical activity is a key part of living well with diabetes.Our expert from Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a member of the     SingHealth​ group, Associate Professor Cindy Ng Li Whye from the Department of Physiotherapy weighs in - Exercise has been documented in many studies to improve the body’s ability to use the glucose in the blood and decrease insulin resistance. If you have diabetes, aerobic training such as walking, jogging and cycling, will help to control your condition to an extent similar to that of some oral diabetic medications. Weight training may be beneficial as it preserves muscle tissue that is otherwise slowly lost with age.Along with a proper meal planning approach and taking your diabetes medications as prescribed, a diabetic can still LIVE WELL!How exercise benefits people for diabetes“Physical activity increases your body cells’ sensitivity to insulin, ​making insulin work better for you in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy,” says Ms Kala Adaikan, Senior Principal Dietitian from the​ 
   Department of Dietetics at SGH.Your body cells can also remove glucose from your blood using a mechanism totally separate from insulin during exercise. Exercise has the potential to consistently lower your blood glucose levels and eventually lower HbA1c. This may result in you requiring fewer diabetes medications or less insulin.Exercise and risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) If you have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and are on insulin therapy, you are at risk of early (during exercise) and late onset (hours after or overnight) 
   hypoglycaemia after exercise.How your blood glucose levels behave will also depend on the following factors:
​Type of exercise (aerobic or anaerobic)
Duration of exercise
Intensity of exerciseDepending on these factors and your pre-exercise blood glucose levels, you may be required to take additional carbohydrates or reduce insulin, or do both.Recommended Amount of exerciseIf you have type 2 diabetes, at least 150 minutes of accumulated moderate intensity aerobic physical activity per week as well as resistance strength training is recommended.To achieve 150 minutes of physical activity in a week, try to do 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week.In addition, physical activity paired with a well thought-out meal planning approach and nutrition intervention for weight loss has been shown to help people achieve:Weight controlImproved glycaemiaImproved blood pressureImproved lipid profileBefore embarking on an exercise regimen, it i​​s essential that you receive prior education on exercise management strategies.If you want to be active, or you are experiencing hypoglycaemia with activity, you should seek advice from your diabetes care team.","requires maintaining regular exercise, proper meal planning and taking diabetes medications as prescribed",neutral,"

Does exercise help manage diabetes?,https://www.diabetes.ca/nutrition---fitness/exercise---activity," Regular exercise has special advantages if you have diabetes. Regular physical activity improves your body’s sensitivity to insulin and helps manage your blood sugar levels. Exercise is a form of physical activity that is done at enough intensity to improve your fitness. Resistance training, brisk walking, cycling, and jogging are examples of exercise. As exercise is more challenging than just accumulating physical activity through your day, it often needs some planning, a certain level of ability, and a little more effort. Benefits of exercise

Weight loss resulting from healthy eating  and increased physical activity enables muscle cells to use insulin and glucose more efficiently, thus lowering diabetes risk. Lack of exercise can cause muscle cells to lose their sensitivity to insulin, which controls levels of sugar in the blood. ""Even if you don't lose weight, exercise will make you stronger and healthier,"" says endocrinologist Douglas Zlock, MD, medical director of the diabetes center at John Muir Health. ""Healthy habits can definitely postpone the onset of diabetes even if they don't prevent it."" The certified diabetes educators at John Muir Health are firm believers that those at risk for diabetes can develop a flexible care program with the help of a diabetes team.

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.cochrane.org/CD008118/HTN_fermented-milk-for-hypertension," Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►



Fermented milk for hypertension 

High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.

Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
""does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects""​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Previous studies have suggested that probiotic fermented milk may possess blood pressure (BP)-lowering properties. In the present study, we aimed to systematically examine the effect of probiotic fermented milk on BP by conducting a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. PubMed, Cochrane library and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to March 2012 to identify eligible studies.The reference lists of the obtained articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate the combined treatment effect. Meta-analysis of fourteen randomised placebo-controlled trials involving 702 participants showed that probiotic fermented milk, compared with placebo, produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg (95% CI 24·64, 21·56) in systolic BP and 1·09 mmHg (95% CI 22·11, 20·06) in diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses suggested a slightly greater effect on systolic BP in hypertensive participants than in normotensive ones (23·98 v. 22·09 mmHg).",produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg,neutral,"

New study reports that fermented milk may have antihypertensive properties that can help reduce hypertension (high blood pressure). The study also examined potential mechanistic pathways of gut modulation via antihypertensive fermented milks. Hypertension is a metabolic disease and risk factor for cardiovascular disease, making it one of the leading causes of death across the world. Gut microbiota impact intestinal development, body metabolism, barrier integrity and function, the immune system and the central nervous system. Diabetes and Hypertension Diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) are significant health problems worldwide, but like cardiac disease and fatty liver disease, people of Indian origin are disproportionately affected.

Over the past decade, interest has been rising in fermented dairy foods that promote health and could potentially prevent diseases such as hypertension (high blood pressure). Functional dairy products that lower blood pressure and heart rate may offer consumers an effective alternative to antihypertensive drugs if their effectiveness can be demonstrated. Investigators reporting in the Journal of Dairy Science® review the scientific basis of reported claims and identify opportunities for developing products based on new lactic acid bacteria. advertisement

Drinking kefir -- a fermented probiotic milk known to help maintain the balance of good bacteria in the digestive system -- can have a positive effect on blood pressure by promoting communication between the gut and brain, a study conducted on rats has found. After nine weeks of kefir supplementation, the treated rats had lower levels of endotoxins -- toxic substances associated with a disruption in the cells -- lower blood pressure and improved intestinal permeability when compared with the untreated group. In addition, kefir supplementation restored the natural balance of four different bacteria in the gut and of an enzyme in the brain essential for normal nervous system function, suggesting that the nervous and digestive systems work together to reduce hypertension, the results showed.

We decided to use blood pressure measurements taken by the subjects at home to avoid the “white coat” effect, which is generally known to influence blood pressure measurements taken in a doctor's office. This effect was also seen in the present study: home systolic blood pressure measurements were ≈10 mm Hg lower those taken during the pretrial visits. The high reproducibility and low placebo effect on the home blood pressure measurements in hypertensive subjects were described earlier (12).The subjects included represented normal consumers of different ages, sexes, and lifestyles. Age, sex, and antihypertensive medication had no significant interaction effects. Subjects were advised not to change their exercise or eating habits during the study, as confirmed by their unchanged body weights.The intervention time (5 mo) was estimated to be long enough to demonstrate the persistence of the effects shown previously in shorter studies (8, 10).",significantly attenuate the development of hypertension,neutral,"

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/172/1/11.xml," Our finding of lower HRs and fasting plasma glucose levels in T2D patients during ingestion of fermented milk needs further validation.IntroductionClinical and experimental studies carried out in spontaneously hypertensive rats have reported that biologically active peptides derived from fermented milk has a blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects (1, 2). Most of the studies examined the tripeptides isoleucine–proline–proline and valine–proline–proline released by degradation of milk proteins (especially casein) during fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus (1). The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of milk peptides is mainly supposed to be the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by the tripeptides (1). ACE is important in the regulation of BP by converting angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin, thereby increasing the BP.Even a small decrease in BP may be associated with a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Thus, a recent study has shown that a decrease of 5.6 mmHg in systolic BP (SBP) and 2.2 mmHg in diastolic BP (DBP) reduced the relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event by 9% (3). A recent Cochrane review including 15 intervention studies has only found a modest decrease of 2.45 mmHg in SBP with no effect of fermented milk on DBP, thus the authors did not support the use of fermented milk to reduce BP in hypertension (4).",blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect,neutral,"

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321643," This fermented milk drink has been shown to bring many health benefits, and now, researchers explain how it could protect cardiovascular health.Share on PinterestKefir is a tasty, healthful drink that works wonders for our gut microbiota. This, it turns out, could also keep cardiovascular problems at bay.Kefir is a milk-based drink made by adding kefir grains — whitish grains obtained through the fermentation of specific bacteria and yeast — that allow it to obtain the specific creamy thickness and slightly sour taste.This probiotic drink has traditionally been tied to numerous benefits — especially its wholesome effects on the gut microbiome and digestion.But now we know that the bacteria in our guts influence more than just a good digestion.The microorganisms that populate our guts have been shown to communicate with the brain, which gives them the potential to influence plenty of processes in our body.A study from last year even showed that people with coronary heart disease exhibited differences in the composition of their gut microbiota, compared with people without this condition.Probiotics to the rescue?Another paper, this one published in the journal Nature, noted that a well-balanced gut microbiome could protect against high blood pressure, though the underlying biological mechanisms through which it is able to accomplish this remained unclear.Yet this discovery led the study’s authors to hypothesize that we could wield probiotic supplements as a weapon against hypertension, as they would promote healthful bacterial diversity.“I think,” said one of the scientists, “certainly there’s some promise in developing probiotics that could be targeted to possibly fixing some of the effects of a high-salt diet [responsible for high blood pressure].”However, researchers at Auburn University in Alabama and the University of Vila Velha in Espirito Santo, Brazil, are taking the question closer to home.In a recent study, they worked with a rat model to see whether kefir’s probiotic properties would influence gut health and help to lower blood pressure.Their findings were presented earlier this week at the annual Experimental Biology conference, held in San Diego, CA.From gut to brain to cardiovascular systemIn order to see whether, and how, a diet that consistently integrated kefir would influence blood pressure, the team — which was led by Mirian Silva-Cutini, of Auburn University — worked with three different groups of rats:Those in the first group had high blood pressure, and they were given kefir on a regular basis for a period of 9 weeks.Those in the second group also had high blood pressure, but they were not given kefir.Those in the third group had no blood pressure problems, and they were not given kefir (the controls).After the 9-week period, stool and blood samples were taken taken from all the rats in order to establish which changes had — or had not — occurred in their gut microbiota, and to test for specific toxins that might be released by some bacteria.Blood pressure was also measured, and the team used “immunofluorescence” to look at patterns of neural changes in the hypothalamus. This region of the brain plays an important role in regulating some basic processes in the body, including blood pressure.Silva-Cutini and colleagues discovered that the rats who had regularly been consuming kefir for 9 weeks exhibited lower levels of endotoxins, which are harmful substances that are a byproduct of bacterial disintegration. Endotoxins are known to contribute to inflammation.The same rats also presented lower blood pressure and had an improved intestinal structure, as the permeability — that is, how easily various microbes and substances can leak into the system — of the intestines was lowered.Another finding was that kefir-drinking rats had regained the balance of helpful bacteria in the gut microbiota, and the level of inflammation in their central nervous systems was reduced.The results indicate that kefir’s effect on gut bacteria is reflected in the kinds of signals transmitted by the brain to the rest of the system. Thus, a balanced gut microbiome appears to influence the brain to lower blood pressure to healthy levels.“Our data suggests that kefir antihypertensive-associated mechanisms involve gut microbiota-brain axis communication during hypertension,” the researchers conclude.HypertensionCardiovascular / CardiologyInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesNutrition / DietShare this articleBy Maria Cohut, Ph.D. on April 27, 2018 — Fact checked by Jasmin CollierLatest newsAlzheimer's: Does genetic predisposition to ADHD increase risk later in life?Are meat substitutes missing key nutrients, and if so, which?New PTSD treatment avenue?

Blood pressure can rise and fall during the day, but when it stays high over time, it is diagnosed as hypertension. This is a condition in which blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than what is considered normal, requiring the heart to work too hard. If it’s not brought under control, hypertension can lead to heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. Since hypertension often has no symptoms, it’s vital to have your blood pressure checked regularly. With proper management, you can cut your risk of stroke by 40 percent and your risk of heart attack by 25 percent.","Yes, milk can reduce blood pressure",neutral,"

Can dupixent treat eczema?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326617," It’s typically caused by genetics or an overactive immune system.Usually, treatment for eczema starts with topical creams or ointments to help relieve itching and redness. However, Dupixent is an option for people with moderate to severe eczema that’s not responding to topical treatments.Mild eczema typically doesn’t affect your everyday life. However, moderate or severe eczema may interfere with your daily activities. Also, you may feel like you can’t control the itching that comes with moderate to severe eczema. You can find more information about eczema in the Medical News Today dermatology hub.In 16-week clinical trials for eczema, 44% to 51% of the people taking Dupixent had a 75% decrease in their symptoms. In comparison, about 12% to 15% of people taking a placebo (a treatment without an active drug) experienced a 75% decrease in symptoms.Of the adults with eczema, 36% to 41% had a significant decrease in itching after 16 weeks.",Dupixent is an option for people with moderate to severe eczema,yes,"

Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as “eczema,” which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy.",Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids,neutral,"

This medicine is authorised for use in the European Union. Overview







Dupixent is a medicine used to treat patients aged 12 years or over with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema, when the skin is itchy, red and dry) when treatments applied to the skin are not sufficient or appropriate. Patients from 6 up to 12 years of age can also be given the medicine if their condition is severe.Dupixent may be added to maintenance treatment for severe asthma in patients aged 6 years or more, whose asthma is not properly controlled by appropriate combination therapy (high-dose corticosteroids over 12 years of age, medium-to-high dose in those younger, taken by inhalation, plus another medicine used for the prevention of asthma). Dupixent is only for use in patients with a type of inflammation of the airways called ‘type 2 inflammation’.Dupixent can also be added to local treatment with corticosteroids for adults who have inflammation of the nose and sinuses together with growths (polyps) obstructing the airways in the nose (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis). It is used when other treatments have not worked well enough.Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab.",atopic dermatitis,neutral,"

Sasson and her collaborators were inspired to launch the trial after discovering that patients with COVID-19 were at significantly greater risk of needing a ventilator if their blood contained high levels of interleukin-13, a driver of inflammation in the body. Dupilumab, sold under the brand name Dupixent, works by blocking the effects of IL-13. The federal Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab in 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema (an itchy skin condition also known as atopic dermatitis). Dupilumab is now also used to treat patients with asthma and chronic sinus inflammation.

In both studies, treatment with dupilumab resulted in a fast, dose-dependent efficacy in all clinical outcomes.51 The achievement of a 50% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-50) by day 29 was significantly higher for all dupilumab doses combined compared to placebo (59% vs 19%, respectively; p<0.05). Significant improvement in other clinical endpoints was observed in the combined treatment groups by day 29 when compared with placebo, including the investigator's Global Assessment score (IGA), the Body Surface Area (BSA) percentage and the pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS).Also, significant rapid dose-dependent changes in the RNA-expression profile in lesional skin were observed after 4 weeks of treatment with dupilumab, approaching non-lesional expression profiles and accompanying EASI improvement. An improvement of 24% and 49% was observed in lesional transcriptome in patients treated with dupilumab 150 and 300mg, respectively, as compared with a 21% shift to a lesional molecular phenotype in the placebo group (p<0.0001 for all groups).49 Also, the suppression in the expression of K16, a keratinocyte proliferation marker and regulator of innate immunity was observed, suggesting that dupilumab reduces epidermal hyperplasia.47Phase IIbThe phase IIb trial was a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in which 380 adult subjects with moderato-to-severe AD were randomized to placebo (n=61) or dupilumab 100mg every 4 weeks (qw4) (n=65), 200mg every 2 weeks (qw2) (n=61), or 300mg/qw (n=63), qw2 (n=64) or qw4 (n=65).52,53 Overall, dupilumab demonstrated higher effectiveness when compared to placebo at all dosing levels. At week 16, EASI scores were significantly improved in the dupilumab groups versus placebo group. The least-squares (LS) mean percent improvement in EASI scores were -74% (300mg/qw), -68% (300mg/qw2), -65% (200mg/qw2), -64% (300mg/qw4), and -45% (100mg/qw4) compared with -18% for placebo (p<0.0001 for all comparison).",dupilumab reduces epidermal hyperplasia,neutral,"

The blockade by dupilumab of these key drivers of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)–mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of related diseases, including atopic dermatitis. MethodsWe performed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adults who had moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis despite treatment with topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Dupilumab was evaluated as monotherapy in two 4-week trials and in one 12-week trial and in combination with topical glucocorticoids in another 4-week study. End points included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, the investigator's global assessment score, pruritus, safety assessments, serum biomarker levels, and disease transcriptome. ResultsIn the 4-week monotherapy studies, dupilumab resulted in rapid and dose-dependent improvements in clinical indexes, biomarker levels, and the transcriptome.",topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors,neutral,"

However, none of these prior studies looked specifically at online yoga programs for people with this condition, until now.The new study involved 212 people with knee osteoarthritis. All participants had access to online information about osteoarthritis, treatment options, and the benefits of physical activity, weight loss, and healthy sleep habits.Researchers randomly assigned around half of the people to do a 12-week self-paced online yoga program.The program consisted of a series of 12 pre-recorded 30-minute videos. People were asked to do one video a week, three times during the week.The classes included a slow-paced mix of static and dynamic yoga poses designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles of the core and legs. Instructors also offered different modifications and levels of the poses, so people could adapt the program to suit their personal needs and abilities.However, the classes focused on physical postures but didn’t include other aspects of yoga, such as deep relaxation, chanting, and meditation, which could also help reduce pain.Physical function improved with yogaAfter 12 weeks, subjects who did the yoga classes saw greater improvements on average in their physical function, knee stiffness, and quality of life, compared to those who only had access to online osteoarthritis education.Still, there was only a small difference between the two groups in the level of knee pain while walking at 12 weeks.After the program ended, researchers followed up with participants another 12 weeks later. By then, both groups had similar levels of physical function, pain, knee stiffness, and quality of life.This loss of benefits seen in the yoga group may be because many people stopped doing the yoga classes after the 12-week program ended.During the last week of the course, over two-thirds of participants completed at least two classes a week.",improve pain,neutral,"

Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026480/," Thus, yoga incorporates several elements of exercise that may be beneficial for arthritis.To cope with pain, arthritis patients often reduce activity 10;11. However, inactivity can result in muscle or tendon shortening, articular capsule contraction and weakened ligaments 12. Conversely, regular activity may decrease pain and preserve stability 13;14.While there was once concern that exercise might increase inflammation and exacerbate pain, regular physical activity is now recommended as part of comprehensive treatment of arthritis 15-18. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 19, Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 20 and the Ottawa Panel 21 note that stretching, strengthening and conditioning exercises can preserve physical function, increase strength and improve endurance for people with arthritis. All persons with arthritis should consult with their doctor to determine a safe and appropriate approach to increasing physical activityUnfortunately, long term exercise maintenance is uncommon even for healthy individuals, generally approaching 50% after six months 22. Vigorous exercise is ideal for physical health 23 and may be acceptable for some persons with arthritis 24;25, but could be intolerable and may not be recommended for those with significant joint instability or damage 26;27.",regular activity may decrease pain and preserve stability,neutral,"

This preliminary evidence is encouraging and suggests that yoga may help sedentary individuals with arthritis safely increase physical activity and improve physical and psychological health as well as quality of life. In summary, the current body of evidence points towards decreased pain in yoga program participants and suggests improvements in several risk indices mentioned previously such as mood and quality of life. However, additional studies with active comparison groups in diverse settings and other forms of arthritis are necessary to support these findings and establish the benefits of yoga in relation to traditional exercise. Currently, an ongoing pilot study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, in Maryland is the first to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga intervention for arthritis in minority communities.",the current body of evidence points towards decreased pain in yoga program participants,neutral,"

Online Yoga Program Improves Physical Function in OA


Will Pass
September 20, 2022









Following an online yoga program improves physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis, according to the results of a new randomized control trial. Although pain did not significantly improve in the yoga group, participants only completed about two-thirds of the recommended sessions, suggesting that more benefit may be possible with greater adherence, wrote lead author Kim L. Bennell, PhD, of the University of Melbourne, and colleagues in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ""To date, an online yoga program specifically for people with knee osteoarthritis has not been investigated,"" the investigators said. ""The need for such evidence-based packaged online exercise programs is highlighted in the 2020 U.S. National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis."" Methods and Results 
The trial involved 212 adults aged 45 years or older with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. All patients had access to online educational materials about managing osteoarthritis.",pain did not significantly improve,neutral,"

Without proper management, arthritis affects not only mobility, but also overall health and well-being, participation in valued activities and quality of life. There is no cure for arthritis, but one important way to manage arthritis is to remain active. Yet up to 90% of people with arthritis are less active than public health guidelines suggest, perhaps due to arthritis symptoms such as pain and stiffness, but also because they are unsure of how best to remain active.The study recruited 75 people with either knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to either a wait list or eight weeks of twice-weekly yoga classes, plus a weekly practice session at home. Participants' physical and mental wellbeing was assessed before and after the yoga session by researchers who did not know which group the participants had been assigned to.Compared with the control group, those doing yoga reported a 20% improvement in pain, energy levels, mood and physical function, including their ability to complete physical tasks at work and home.",20%,neutral,"

,is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of chair yoga on pain and physical function in older adults with osteoarthritis. For the study, researchers randomly assigned 131 older adults with osteoarthritis to either the “Sit ‘N’ Fit Chair Yoga©” program developed by Kristine Lee or a health education program. Participants attended 45-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. Researchers measured pain, pain interference (how it affects one’s life), balance, gait speed, fatigue and functional ability, before, during and after the sessions. Results from the study found that participants in the chair yoga group, compared to those in the health education program, showed a greater reduction in pain and pain interference during their sessions, and that reduction in pain interference lasted for about three months after the 8-week chair yoga program was completed.

Improvements in those who completed yoga was still apparent nine months later.Clifton O. Bingham III, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center, says the idea for the study grew out of his experiences treating patients with arthritis. “It was watching what happened with my patients and the changes in their lives as a result of practicing yoga that got me interested in the first place.”Compared with the control group, those doing yoga reported a 20% improvement in pain, energy levels, mood and physical function, including their ability to complete physical tasks at work and home Image is for illustrative purposes only.Safety was a priority in the study, the authors say. “For people with other conditions, yoga has been shown to improve pain, pain-related disability and mood,” says Bingham.",20%,neutral,"

Does yoga help reduce pain from arthritis and improve physical function?,https://lermagazine.com/article/yoga-for-knee-oa-pain-a-mind-body-approach," Participants reported improvements in knee pain, self-reported physical function, and affect (expressed emotional responses); however, walking performance remained unchanged.39 In a different study, after seven yoga classes, the number of nights with insomnia (self-reported) was significantly improved in 13 women with OA in any joint.41 A case series of 14 people with symptomatic knee OA also showed yoga was associated with improved quality of life.35
Although these early studies point to the potential for improvement in physical and mental health after yoga, it is important to note that the improvements were limited to self-reported measures, and the exposure to yoga was relatively short and infrequent. Because self-reported function and actual performance are not well-correlated,42 it is important for research to include both types of measurements. Recently, we conducted a simple yoga trial in 38 women with symptomatic knee OA who completed 12 weeks of supervised yoga-based strengthening exercise three times a week.43 A unique element of our yoga program is that we selected yoga postures (eg, lunges, squats, stretches) that would minimize patients’ exposures to knee joint loads known to worsen structural disease in the knee.43 Our “biomechanical” yoga program (see Figure 1, below) improved pain, self-reported physical function, objective measures of mobility performance (eg, walking speed), and knee extensor and flexor strength. However, we observed no changes in physical fitness or knee mechanics during walking and yoga postures or in muscle activation after the yoga intervention.44
These findings show yoga can improve muscle strength in women with knee OA, which translates to improved mobility. Nonetheless, it is important to note that, in all of these early studies, including ours, the small samples and lack of comparison with a control group means we cannot be sure if enrollment in the study itself (that is, the attention and the researchers’ intention to address each patient’s chronic knee problems) is responsible for the improvements, rather than the yoga intervention. Controlled trials
A handful of studies have compared outcomes after a yoga intervention with those of a control group.",improved pain,neutral,"

Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470206/," Acute treatment of cluster headache episodes can be relieved by administering sumatriptan subcutaneously. [1] According to clinical studies, sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for migraines when given intranasally, subcutaneously, or orally. It relieves photophobia, nausea, headache, and functional disability. Non-FDA-approved indications of sumatriptan include the treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. [2]Mechanism of ActionSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) has a central role in the pathophysiology of a migraine.

Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601116.html," Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the head, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Sumatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.How should this medicine be used? Sumatriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache.If your symptoms improve after you take sumatriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet.

Bottom line
The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was useful for treating migraine attacks in the studies we found.

Sumatriptan succinate is a generic prescription drug used for the treatment of acute migraine and cluster headaches. Migraine symptoms are due to the widening of blood vessels in the head when the trigeminal nerve is overstimulated. Drugs like sumatriptan, known as triptans or 5HT receptor agonists, relieve migraine symptoms by tightening blood vessels in the head. Many people achieve significant relief from migraine symptoms using sumatriptan in its various formats, but this medication is not right for everyone. Side effects can sometimes be serious, and sumatriptan can worsen underlying medical conditions or interact with other medications being taken. RELATED: Learn more about sumatriptan

Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2000/0101/p180.html," Although non-pharmacologic interventions play a role in headache management, most migraine patients seek relief with medication. Approximately 95 percent of patients with severe migraine take some medication (prescription or over-the-counter) for their headaches.2 A survey of patients with migraine indicated that they desire a medication that provides quick, sustained pain relief and also decreases the likelihood of recurrence.3 




Although injectable sumatriptan (Imitrex Statdose) appears to be effective in aborting migraine attacks, many patients are reluctant to self-administer an injection.4–6 Oral medication for the acute treatment of migraine is the most convenient route of administration but is often impractical because of the high association of nausea and vomiting with migraine attacks. Up to 92 percent of patients have experienced nausea during a migraine attack, and 50 to 68 percent also have vomited.3,7 In addition, the absorption of oral medications may be delayed or diminished because of the high prevalence of gastroparesis during the attack.8–10 




The recently approved intranasal forms of dihydroergotamine mesylate (Migranal) and sumatriptan (Imitrex) may help alleviate some of the aforementioned problems. The intranasal route of administration is less invasive than self-administration of an injection and offers the advantage of bypassing the need for gastric absorption.

For both SAD and other types of depression, light therapy has unique characteristics that make it an attractive alternative to medications, Dr. Schwartz notes. Antidepressant drugs often take several weeks to start working, and sometimes cause bothersome side effects including nausea, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. In people who respond well to light therapy, depression symptoms usually start improving within a week, and the side effects, which include eye strain and headaches, are uncommon and mild.

Light therapySome people with SAD find that light therapy can help improve their mood considerably. This involves sitting by a special lamp called a light box, usually for around 30 minutes to an hour each morning.Light boxes come in a variety of designs, including desk lamps and wall-mounted fixtures. They produce a very bright light. The intensity of the light is measured in lux – the higher lux, the brighter the light.The light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months.It's thought the light may improve SAD by encouraging your brain to reduce the production of melatonin (a hormone that makes you sleepy) and increase the production of serotonin (a hormone that affects your mood).Sunrise alarm clocks, which gradually light up your bedroom as you wake up, may also be useful for some people.Who can use light therapy?Most people can use light therapy safely.",Most people can use light therapy safely,neutral,"

Hoffman, an assistant professor at Michigan State University who studies how light affects our physiology. Symptoms of SAD can include feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, difficulty concentrating, and the loss of libido, to name a few, says Dr. Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Norman E. Rosenthal, the clinician and researcher credited with discovering SAD, also says that many may feel less energetic and have a greater need for sleep and an increased appetite — “especially for sweets and starches.” If you think you might be suffering from SAD, the best first step is to talk to your doctor or therapist. The most common treatment for SAD is light therapy, a.k.a. “SAD lamps.” These lamps are specially “designed to mimic sunlight” and when used correctly, can cause chemical changes in the brain, tricking it into thinking it’s summer so it will release much-needed serotonin. But according to Janna Gordon-Elliott, a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork–Presbyterian, SAD lamps aren’t regulated by the FDA, so it’s important to not just “buy the cheapest thing on Amazon or the thing that’s more portable.” With that said, the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, a nonprofit research and education institution and the leading authority on SAD and light therapy, does offer guidance on what to look for in a legitimate SAD lamp as well as other helpful resources.","when used correctly, can cause chemical changes in the brain",neutral,"

The best-known NSAIDs used for acute migraine treatment are ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®) and naproxen sodium (Aleve®, Anaprox®), both available over-the-counter (non-prescription) and by prescription. Flurbiprofen, diclofenac potassium (Cataflam®, diclofenac sodium, Voltaren®, Zipsor®), nabumetone, mefenamic acid and others have been demonstrably effective in treating acute migraine. Indomethacin (Indocin®) is another FDA-approved NSAID widely used for the treatment of migraine and other primary headache disorders like hemicrania continua, and Cambia®—a powdered formulation of diclofenac potassium that is dissolved in water and taken as an oral solution—was found to be effective in treating moderate to severe acute migraine in two large clinical trials.

We also collected data for pain‐free and headache relief outcomes at one hour if reported. Secondary outcomes We considered the following secondary outcomes:    sustained pain‐free during the 24 hours post dose (pain‐free within two hours, with no use of rescue medication or recurrence of moderate to severe pain within 24 hours);    sustained headache relief during the 24 hours post dose (headache relief at two hours, sustained for 24 hours, with no use of rescue medication or a second dose of study medication);    adverse events: participants with any adverse event during the 24 hours post dose; serious adverse events; adverse events leading to withdrawal. Other outcomes We also collected data for other outcomes, where reported, including:    use of rescue medication;   relief of headache‐associated symptoms;   relief of functional disability.

Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/206387," There were 6 primary outcome measures. The primary outcome measures were chosen because they represent the spectrum of the key symptoms responsible for disability in migraine and measure both the early (2-hour) and sustained (24-hour) relief of these symptoms. The first 4 of these outcome measures, which compared sumatriptan–naproxen sodium with placebo, were the percentages of patients who had headache relief 2 hours after dosing (ie, the reduction of pain from moderate/severe intensity to mild/no pain without use of rescue medication at each of the prespecified time points), absence of photophobia, absence of phonophobia, and absence of nausea. The other 2 outcome measures, which compared sumatriptan–naproxen sodium with its individual components, were the percentages of patients with sustained pain-free response (ie, moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to no pain from 2 hours through 24 hours after dosing with no use of rescue medication). A secondary efficacy outcome measure 2 hours after dosing was the percentage of patients with pain-free response (moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to no pain). Secondary efficacy outcome measures also included the percentages of patients with sustained headache relief (ie, moderate or severe pain at treatment reduced to mild or no pain from 2 hours through 24 hours after dosing, with no use of rescue medication); sustained freedom from nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia from 2 through 24 hours after dosing; use of rescue medication through 24 hours after dosing; and headache recurrence (ie, return of moderate or severe pain within 24 hours of dosing among patients with headache relief 2 hours after dosing).",sustained (24-hour,neutral,"

Many people who have migraines find that over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen, can help to reduce their symptoms. They tend to be most effective if taken at the first signs of a migraine attack, as this gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms. It's not advisable to wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers, as it's often too late for the medicine to work. Tablets you dissolve in a glass of water (soluble painkillers) are a good alternative because they're absorbed quickly by your body. If you cannot swallow painkillers because of nausea or vomiting, suppositories may be a better option.

However, it has a slower time of onset than ibuprofen, meaning that it may take longer to feel naproxen’s effects.The typical recommended dosage of naproxen for acute migraine is 500 mg. In some cases, doses of up to 825 mg have been used.A 2020 review found that although naproxen was superior to a placebo for relieving migraine pain, other commonly used pain relievers have reported better results.

Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(12)01010-4/fulltext," The medication combination chosen here addresses two mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology–triptan as a serotonin receptor agonist and naproxen as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. The 3 doses were equally effective and well tolerated, suggesting that the lowest dose should be sufficient, though higher doses could be beneficial in older adolescents or to obtain more prolonged relief. Further, one wonders how each agent individually would have fared in comparison with the combination, especially in light of previous reports that each agent alone was ineffective in acute migraine. The present results suggest a synergism with the combination agent, which has also been shown to be effective in adults with acute migraine.

base of hair follicles. This inflammation, depending on its location, can take the form
of a superficial pustule (contains pus), a pimple, a deeper cyst, congested pores, whiteheads, or blackheads. Treatments vary depending on the severity of the acne. Acne develops when cells and natural oils begin to block up tiny hair follicles in the skin.","

However, in 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned triclosan as an ingredient in antiseptic washes after finding evidence to suggest that it can decrease thyroid hormone levels and potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance.As of early 2019, commercially available toothpaste no longer contains triclosan.Toothpaste contains many ingredients that benefit dental health, such as:glycerinsorbitolcalcium carbonatesodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)However, many of these ingredients are too harsh to use on the skin.

Can I get rid of a pimple overnight by applying toothpaste?,https://greatist.com/health/toothpaste-on-pimples," Should you use toothpaste on pimples?The reasoning behind using toothpaste on pimples is simple: Toothpaste typically contains ingredients like baking soda and alcohol, which can dry out a zit and get rid of it — or at least make it less obvious. “Toothpaste can dry out a pimple because of the drying ingredients it contains,” says Dr. Marie Hayag, a New York-based board certified dermatologist. “But these ingredients, which include alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, sodium lauryl sulfate, herbal extracts and oils, and propylene glycol, can also irritate your skin by causing redness and peeling.” So, yes, toothpaste will probably get rid of acne, but it could end up doing more harm than good. You could be left with overly dry, irritated skin that’s just as frustrating as that pimple would have been.

This combination has been more extensively studied.A 2015 2-year double-blind, randomized study showed no differences in pain or joint space narrowing — a sign of cartilage deterioration — after taking either 1,500 mg/day of glucosamine sulfate, 800 mg/day of chondroitin sulfate, a combination of both, or a placebo (12).Similar results were observed in a 2018 analysis, where combined glucosamine and chondroitin didn’t significantly improve pain or stiffness. Meanwhile, chondroitin alone led to minor improvements in pain (13).On the other hand, another 2018 analysis observed a significant improvement in pain scores when glucosamine and chondroitin were taken together, while no improvements were found when the supplements were taken separately (14).Similarly, a 2015 sponsored study showed that combining 1,500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride with 1,200 mg of chondroitin sulfate effectively reduced knee osteoarthritis pain, stiffness, and swelling compared with 200 mg of the osteoarthritis NSAID celecoxib (15).Another 2015 study also found that combined glucosamine and chondroitin supplements were comparably effective as celecoxib (16).Ultimately, no firm conclusions can be made on the effectiveness of glucosamine, chondroitin, or the two combined as a treatment for osteoarthritic pain or stiffness.

My approach to managing patients is to first reduce LDL-C to goal with maximal tolerated doses of statins, then assess the triglyceride levels.”Saseen also discussed the importance of understanding the differences among prescription omega-3 products, as there are EPA-only prescription products and EPA plus DHA combination products. “When selecting between prescription products to manage hypertriglyceridemia, the EPA-only products do not appear to increase LDL levels, whereas the combination products may increase LDL, and some experts have theorized that this may be potentially atherogenic,” Saseen told Pharmacy Today.“The best data we have is from the REDUCE-IT trial, in which the EPA-only product icosapent ethyl (Vascepa—Amarin), when added to statin therapy, resulted in a significant reduction in adverse CV events compared with statin monotherapy in patients with moderate to highly elevated triglycerides.”Highlights of new advisoryThe AHA science advisory states that clinicians should first assess patients for causes of hypertriglyceridemia, including medications (e.g., estrogen or corticosteroids), lifestyle (e.g., excessive alcohol or sugar intake), medical conditions (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes or hypothyroidism), and genetics.Modifiable causes should be addressed before pharmacotherapy is initiated. This may include switching medications and making lifestyle changes, such as reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption, increasing the amount of exercise, and eating a heart-healthy diet.View Large

Those with triglycerides of 500 mg/dL or greater can expect a reduction of 30% or greater, but increases in LDL with DHA-containing products can occur. AHA also commented on the 25% reduction in major CV events observed in the REDUCE-IT trial with the EPA-only product and the safety of prescription omega-3 products, noting that they are relatively benign, with mild adverse effects that include a fishy taste, diarrhea, and nausea.Rx vs. OTC considerationsClinicians should inform patients that OTC products may not have the same effects as prescription omega-3s.",4 g per day of omega-3 fatty acids,neutral,"

Healthy lifestyle choices – such as getting regular physical activity, losing weight, avoiding sugar and refined carbohydrates, limiting alcohol and choosing healthier fats from plants in place of saturated fats – can help reduce triglycerides.

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2004/0701/p133.html," HYPERLIPIDEMIA




Omega-3 fatty acids lower plasma triglyceride levels, particularly in persons with hyper-triglyceridemia,14 by inhibiting the synthesis of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver. A review15 of human studies concluded that approximately 4 g per day of omega-3 fatty acids reduced serum triglyceride concentrations by 25 to 30 percent, increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 5 to 10 percent, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 1 to 3 percent. Total cholesterol was not significantly affected.15 




A randomized controlled trial16 compared two groups of patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. One group received simvastatin in a dosage of 10 to 40 mg per day plus 4 g per day of Omacor (which contains 90 percent omega-3 fatty acid; 840 mg EPA plus DHA per capsule), while those in the second group received the same dosage of simvastatin and a placebo. Patients who received simvastatin plus Omacor had 20 to 30 percent decreases in serum triglyceride concentrations and 30 to 40 percent decreases in VLDL cholesterol levels compared with those receiving simvastatin and placebo.16 No increases in LDL cholesterol levels were observed. Overall, results have shown variable effects of omega-3 fatty acids on total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels.14–17 




HYPERTENSION




Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have a dose-response hypotensive effect in patients with hypertension and have little to no effect in normotensive patients.18 A meta-analysis19 of 31 trials and a total of 1,356 patients found that 5.6 g per day of fish oil reduced blood pressure by 3.4/2.0 mm Hg.",lower plasma triglyceride levels,neutral,"

The results of this study corroborate the effectiveness of pharmacologic doses of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing triglyceride concentrations in persons with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Relative to the placebo treatment, fasting triglycerides were reduced by 27% after the 3.4-g/d dose, consistent with previous reports (12, 42–46). The percentage reduction achieved was related to the subjects’ triglyceride concentrations after the placebo dose so that, on average, the subjects with the highest triglycerides achieved the greatest percentage reduction after the higher dose. The lower dose (0.85 g/d) did not alter lipid values, and fasting measures of glucose metabolism were not altered by either dose relative to placebo.As expected, the omega-3 fatty acid composition of erythrocytes increased in a dose-responsive manner, confirming compliance and uptake of omega-3 fatty acids into cellular membranes. After 8 wk of supplementation, the 3.4-g/d dose achieved an average omega-3 index associated with a reduced CVD risk (> 8%) (33). Because the duration of supplementation was only 8 wk, these values do not reflect maximum omega-3 uptake into RBC fatty acids (47).",reducing triglyceride concentrations,neutral,"

Probiotics linked with fewer respiratory symptoms in overweight and older people

				by 
					Benjie Coleman

					14 May 2021
				

















An Imperial led study, which will be presented at Digestive Disease Week 2021, provides further evidence of a relationship between the gut and lungs. Daily probiotic use was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract symptoms in overweight and older people, according to a study that suggests a potential role for probiotics in preventing respiratory infections. “This is not necessarily the most intuitive idea, that putting bacteria into your gut might reduce your risk of respiratory infection,” said Benjamin Mullish, a lead researcher on the study and clinical lecturer in Imperial's Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, “but it's further evidence that the gut microbiome has a complex relationship with our various organ systems. It doesn’t just affect how our gut works or how our liver works, it affects aspects of how our whole body works.” 




Researchers re-analyzed detailed daily diaries of 220 patients who participated in an earlier double-blind placebo-controlled study on probiotics and weight loss. Reviewing the entries for common symptoms of upper respiratory infection, including cough, sore throat and wheezing, researchers found that participants who took probiotics during the six-month study had a 27 percent lower overall incidence of upper respiratory tract symptoms compared to the placebo group. The effect was largest among participants who were aged 45 years or older, as well as those with obesity.",Daily probiotic use,neutral,"

Details for This Review




Study Population: Healthy children and adults from six countries at average risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of URTI, duration of illness, work or school days lost




Harm End Points: Medication adverse effects




Narrative: Most treatments of URTI aim to control symptoms, because URTIs tend to self-remit in a few days to a week. It has been suggested that certain probiotic agents have the potential to prevent and mitigate URTI through immune-modulating properties. This Cochrane review examined 12 randomized trials (n = 3,720) of probiotics vs. placebo to prevent URTI.1 Included trials variably enrolled healthy children, adults, and older adults, while excluding trials examining persons at low risk (competitive athletes) and high risk (children prone to otitis). The studies demonstrated a reduction in episodes (number needed to treat to prevent one URTI = 8 during at least three months of treatment) and duration of URTI (mean difference = −1.89 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.03 to −1.75).",Probiotics for the Prevention of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections,yes,"

Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-194," Current laboratory and clinical data regarding the possibility of the role of probiotics on preventing the development of respiratory tract infections are contradictory, and are somewhat insufficient to recommend strongly their routine use. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions is likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of different pulmonary diseases, and improve our knowledge in the prophylactic role of probiotics in children affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.SummaryA better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs in infants and children. No data have been collected in pediatric patients with chronic underlying diseases, and yet there are no published data concerning treatment of RTIs with probiotics. The very few studies published so far do not indicate which micro-organism or administration regimen might exert beneficial effects as a prevention tool of RTIs both in healthy children and in those with recurrent RTIs. Further research to establish the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of RTIs, including those involving the lower respiratory tract, are required and should also clarify if any susceptible subgroups of respiratory diseases exist, and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains.

Probiotic therapy may offer an interesting alternative in the alleviation or prevention of viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which cause a significant health and economic burden to humans. Based on this review, clinical trials in human subjects show promising data demonstrating that specific probiotics are able to shorten the duration or reduce the risk of respiratory infections. However, only a few clinical studies have actually investigated the effects of probiotics on specific viruses, which are the most common agents causing RTIs. Thus, more clinical research should be targeted to revealing which probiotics or their combinations would be the most effective ones against RTI viruses.There are also contradictory data on probiotic use in the prevention of RTIs. The variability in the outcomes between clinical trials studying probiotics’ role in RTIs may be explained by the use of different probiotic strains, bacterial dose, and matrices.",probiotics are able to shorten the duration or reduce the risk of respiratory infections,yes,"

Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City.",Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis,neutral,"

Holistic Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis
In terms of the treatments I offer, the most useful is Aromatherapy massage
With aromatherapy massage, there are a number of beneficial effects for sufferers of RA:
1) pain relief and decreased stiffness, increased mobility in the joints from the massage 
2) reduction of inflammation due to the use of essential oils in the massage oil. Essential oils are absorbed into the bloodstream during an aromatherapy massage and so continue to work after your treatment has ended. 3) improvement in mood levels due to the release of the ""happy"" hormones during massage
Please note, during an acute flare up where the joints are very painful, massage would not be advisable. In such cases, I would advise Reiki as this doesn't involve any massage or manipulation of the body, is deeply relaxing, can bring pain relief and can also help to improve mood levels.

We discuss the most common methods of application and suitable essential oils below.Aromatherapy massageWhen a child falls over, they are often told to ‘rub it better’, and this is something that we sometimes do as adults. For some reason, this action seems to reduce the pain, and this is possibly because our nerve pathways are being stimulated to interrupt the pain signal to the brain, sometimes referred to as the pain gate mechanism. The same theory may be applied to aromatherapy massage in which the affected area is ‘rubbed’ using massage techniques, such as gentle effleurage and petrissage. However, it is important to note that pain indicates damage, so massaging inflamed sites should be done with care. Massage may provide short-term relief from pain because there is also an increase of endorphins released into the blood-stream as a result of the stimulation and these hormones are natural pain killers.",cannot cure osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis,neutral,"

Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/what-types-of-alopecia-can-minoxidil-treat," Since there are different types of alopecia, you need to see a medical professional to find out which kind you have. Depending on the reason for your hair loss, they may recommend the medication minoxidil.What Is Minoxidil?Minoxidil is a non-prescription drug that can spur hair growth and keep you from losing more hair, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Minoxidil comes in foam and solution forms. You rub it into your scalp, typically once or twice a day, the academy says.What Types of Alopecia Does Minoxidil Treat?“Minoxidil is the FDA-approved treatment of male- and female-pattern hair loss, known as androgenetic alopecia,” dermatologist Adam Mamelak, MD, tells WebMD Connect to Care. Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of alopecia, according to NYU Langone Health. About 50 million men in the United States have it.Mamelak says minoxidil “is also showing its usefulness” for:Alopecia areata: an autoimmune disease that often causes round or oval bald patches, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Telogen effluvium: hair loss that can be triggered by a variety of things, from childbirth to surgery to severe stress, according to Harvard Medical SchoolChemotherapy-induced hair lossMinoxidil works best if you use it soon after you start losing hair.",androgenetic alopecia,neutral,"

The Research on Taking Minoxidil Orally for Hair Loss Is LackingSo far, there isn’t enough high-quality research to support oral minoxidil for hair loss. But a handful of small studies suggest that oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss, and may be more effective for some patients than topical treatments, Dr. Sattur says.For example, one small observational study involving 100 women experiencing female pattern hair loss suggested that a daily pill containing 0.25 milligrams (mg) minoxidil and 25 mg spironolactone was safe and effective in treating the condition. But the study did not use a control group, so it’s not clear whether these results are due to the medication.A later review, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in July 2020, looked at 17 studies involving 634 patients. The review suggested that oral minoxidil was a generally effective and well-tolerated alternative to topical minoxidil, though researchers add that larger, controlled studies are needed.5. There’s No Standard Dosage for Oral MinoxidilSattur points out that most of these studies looked at doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 5 mg — less than the doses used for hypertension.",oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss,yes,"

Recently, a retrospective review was conducted among 36 female patients with CTE treated daily with oral minoxidil at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 mg.

Minoxidil’s primary function is to prevent and slow down hair loss; hair regrowth is more of a side effect. Minoxidil cannot create new hair follicles, so it cannot be used to grow hair that has already been lost.

What’s apparent is that minoxidil decreases hair loss in some people while also increasing hair growth. It doesn’t work for everyone.Minoxidil is also classed as a vasodilator, meaning that it dilates your blood vessels so that blood flows more easily where it’s applied.

Liz deSousa for BYRDIE



No matter how minoxidil works, one thing's for certain: It can greatly benefit those with thinning hair and/or hair loss:



Stimulates hair growth: ""Minoxidil is a topical medication that is applied to the scalp to stimulate new hair growth in those experiencing hair loss,” explains Samantha Fisher, MD, a Florida-based dermatologist. Increases hair thickness and density: In addition to stimulating hair growth and quelling a receding hairline, “Minoxidil can increase the density and thickness of hair,” says Fisher. In other words, strands grow back fuller and healthier. Treats hair disorders: Minoxidil is shown to be effective in promoting hair regrowth and density in patients with Androgenetic alopecia and female pattern hair loss. Hair Type Considerations

Generally speaking, minoxidil is safe for all hair types, including natural hair, although those with color-treated hair may experience more irritation.

Minoxidil, also known as Regaine in the UK or Rogaine in America, is a popular hair loss treatment for male pattern baldness. It is a topical treatment which is applied to the scalp in the form of a spray, foam or liquid. It works by increasing blood flow to the scalp, stimulating hair follicles to produce stronger and healthier strands of hair. It has been scientifically proven that Minoxidil works in around 60% of men. However, Minoxidil will only work for certain types of hair loss or hair thinning, provided that it is applied twice daily without any breaks in treatment.

Alternative medical treatment
Hoxsey Therapy or Hoxsey Method is an alternative medical treatment promoted as a cure for cancer. The treatment consists of a caustic herbal paste for external cancers or an herbal mixture for ""internal"" cancers, combined with laxatives, douches, vitamin supplements, and dietary changes. Reviews by major medical bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society,[1] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,[2] and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,[3] have found no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The sale or marketing of the Hoxsey Method was banned in the United States by the FDA on September 21, 1960 as a ""worthless and discredited"" remedy and a form of quackery. [4]
Currently, the Hoxsey Method is primarily marketed by the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico. Hoxsey Therapy is also marketed over the Internet; in June 2008, the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator noted that ""There is no scientific evidence that it has any value to treat cancer, yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that Hoxsey treatment is effective against the disease.",no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer,no,"

Harry denied his father’s medical history and claimed to his dying day that the AMA had fabricated a false death certificate and that his father had really died of an infection. In any case, the elder Hoxsey passed the cancer formula to Harry on his deathbed and warned him that “they will persecute you, slander you and try to drive you off the face of the earth.” A savior was born.

Some readers may have strong feelings about the Harry Hoxsey cancer treatment story. We present this chapter on the herbal ingredients in Hoxsey’s formula from Kenny Ausubel’s new book When Healing Becomes a Crime—the study of this Dallas-based promoter of natural cancer cures. Modern research has revealed that many of the herbs in this formula contain compounds that have exhibited antioxidant and/or anti-tumor properties in experimental studies. In light of this data, author Ausubel asks whether this formula might be potentially useful in cancer treatment. We publish this chapter with the intention of stimulating discussion on the potential role of herbs and other natural products in the prevention and treatment of cancer and other serious illness and to draw attention to a fascinating chapter in American medical history.",whether this formula might be potentially useful in cancer treatment,neutral,"

According to Harry, John Hoxsey reasoned that the wild plants had caused the stallion’s recovery. He therefore concocted a liquid out of red clover and alfalfa, buckthorn and prickly ash (and other plants which John could not identify), gathered from the area where the stallion had apparently cured himself.

Is the Hoxsey treatment a good cure for cancer?,https://quackwatch.org/related/ota/ota04/," Additional case histories supporting his claims are described in a 1954 publication by Defender Magazine (251). In his book, Hoxsey noted that cancer patients sought his treatment “as a last resort.” He wrote:
We don’t pretend to cure all of them. The vast majority are advanced and even terminal cases by the time we get them. Many come to us after the disease already has spread through the body; after surgery or irradiation has so impaired circulation of the blood to the affected areas that our treatment cannot reach them…Nevertheless we believe we cure a far greater percentage of cases treated than is cured by any other method at present known to science (418). In 947, the medical director of Hoxsey’s clinic stated it more specifically: he claimed they had been curing “85 percent of external cancers, and approximately 25 percent of internal cancers.”(664) In particular, it was noted that the outcome of treatment was “dependent to a great extent upon the lymphatic system, and our best results are in cancers that have a large lymphatic supply.” He stated that many of their patients had had “the limit of X ray and radium” and “in many of these, we cannot hope to cure the cancer itself because of the extensive prior destruction,” but that the Hoxsey treatment might “limit the further extension of the cancer and keep the patient free from pain thereafter.” This director noted, “in almost every case that the general health of the patient improves” as a result of the treatment. He concluded that “we know that the Hoxsey treatment cures cancer, and it is only reasonable to believe that we have within our grasp the cause, and eventually the complete solution, of the cancer problem” (664).",we know that the Hoxsey treatment cures cancer,yes,"

We present a case of a pustular eruption in a patient with cancer treated with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), highlighting the various resources we found useful in guiding our diagnostic workup and treatment. A man in his 60s presented to our dermatology clinic, reporting recurrent acnelike lesions on his nose, cheeks, and upper back (Figure) that had been present for several months and were exacerbated by consumption of seafood. The patient was undergoing treatment for non–small cell carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the brain and liver. Based on this clinical history, one might suspect that his chemotherapeutic regimen included an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, but this was not the case. After pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were ineffective, the patient discontinued all conventional treatments and instead elected to pursue Hoxsey herbal therapy at the Hoxsey Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico.1 As part of his therapy, he had been taking Hoxsey’s “brown tonic” 3 to 4 times daily for the previous 6 to 7 months.","After pneumonectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were ineffective",neutral,"

Hoxsey Formula 





 





Often mentioned in the same breath as 4 Herb Formula, our Hoxsey Formula is like 4 Herb Formula in that it’s an alterative combination designed specifically to support detoxification and the treatment of conditions of a degenerative nature, as well as the general maintenance of good health. A variation on the classic internal tonic formula championed by American health care practitioner Harry Hoxsey in the earlier part of the 20th century
In a short article in HerbalGram, the peer-reviewed journal of the American Botanical Council, eminent botanist Dr. James Duke pointed out that 8 of the 9 herbs in this formula demonstrated antitumor activity in controlled laboratory tests, while 5 herbs had antioxidant qualities that he postulated as protectants against cancer. All of them, moreover, had antimicrobial properties against viral or bacterial infections. This is significant, since there are those who suggest that there is a correlation between the antibacterial properties of a herb and its antitumor activity. Who it’s for:

Importantly, in the 8-week long studies, side effects in the L-theanine groups did not differ from the placebo groups, showing that L-theanine seems to be perfectly safe and well tolerated, even when taken for months. So, if you know you have a stressful event coming up and want to try L-theanine, I’d take the amount shown to be effective by this analysis.

Increased GABA, in turn, increases brain levels of dopamine and serotonin, resulting in general feelings of calm and well-being (Mason 2001). Changes in brain electrical activity measured by EEG are dose-dependent, and are similar to beneficial EEG changes observed in meditation, including increased alpha waves in the occipital and parietal regions (Ito 1998). A calming effect is usually noted within 30 to 40 minutes after L-theanine is taken at a dose of 50 to 200mg, and typically lasts 8 to 10 hours.

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  

Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:



The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)




Steam Inhalation and Sleep

There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  

Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.",doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria,neutral,"

Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,https://www.pari.com/int/blog/the-myth-of-steam-inhalation-why-steam-does-not-help-for-coughs/," The moisture only reaches the upper airways, like the nose and throat, but not the bronchi and lungs. But the mucus that triggers coughing and needs to be dislodged through inhalation is found in the bronchi and lungs.As Dr Rohland the paediatrician also repeatedly explains to parents and his patients: “Inhaling steam is considered a home remedy for colds and coughs. But I recommend using a nebuliser for inhalation because this is the only effective method of inhalation. Using an inhalation device with a jet or membrane nebuliser is the only way to ensure that the fluid being inhaled is vaporised into tiny particles. Only very fine nebulised particles can get into the bronchi and bronchioles and have an effect. This is not a given when inhaling hot water vapour.”   Effective inhalation of saline solution with nebulisers for respiratory distress, wheezing upon exhalation and rales It is not unusual for children in the first three years of life to experience so-called obstructive bronchitis caused by viruses.",Inhaling steam is considered a home remedy,neutral,"

Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,https://fullfact.org/online/steam-covid/," Inhaling steam is a traditional remedy used by some to treat colds, but there’s no evidence it works for that either. A Cochrane review (a system in the UK where all the published evidence for and against a treatment is reviewed) into the practice found that there was no conclusive evidence that it eased cold symptoms or reduced the amount of rhinovirus (which causes colds) people shed. The virus causing the common cold is different to the one that causes Covid-19, but they both cause respiratory illness, which this ‘cure’ is claimed to alleviate. Treating Covid-19 with heat
Multiple trials of treatments for Covid-19 are currently running around the world, but none has yet been proven as a consistently effective cure (although some, such as corticosteroids have been used with some success). Although heat can destroy the virus in the context of disinfecting a surface, there is no evidence to suggest it will work the same way inside the human body. Heating up the sinuses via steam won’t guarantee the virus, if present, will also be heated up to those temperatures, without also damaging the body’s cells first.",there’s no evidence it works for that either,neutral,"

There’s no proof steam inhalation cures Covid-19.While steaming has emerged as a popular home remedy to beat Covid, doctors say all it does is ease a stuffy nose. Even though steaming is useful to relieve congestion or cold in the upper respiratory tract, it does not help with pneumonia or any condition of the lung or help treat an infection in any way, clarify experts.However, steaming carries a high risk of scalding, or burning, of both skin and airways, when done improperly or incorrectly. This is in no way enough evidence to warrant encouraging people to inhale steam to prevent or treat Covid-19, especially if it means they don’t adhere as strictly to proven methods of prevention, for example, increased handwashing, wearing face coverings, and social distancing.Inhaling steam is a traditional remedy used by some to treat colds, but there’s no evidence it works for that either. * All content published is for general information purposes only and should not be construed as medical advice.

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495," Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety. The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better. How does exercise help depression and anxiety? Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:

Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety

Regular exercise has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you:

Depression is more than just a low mood – it’s a serious condition that has an impact on both physical and mental health. One in six women and one in eight men will experience depression at some point in their lives. While the exact cause of depression isn't known, a number of things can be associated with its development. Generally, depression does not result from a single cause, but from a combination of biological factors (such as family history, serious medical illness or drug and alcohol use), early childhood experiences, personality factors, recent stressful life events and other personal factors.Exercise and depression evidenceSome  studies  have found that exercise can be a moderately helpful treatment for mild to moderate depression in adults.

      The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at 15 studies involving over 190,000 people to determine how much exercise was needed to reduce depression. Adults who did activities equivalent to 1.25 hours of brisk walking per week had an 18% lower risk of depression compared with those who did not exercise, the study said. Moving up to an “activity volume equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking per week was associated with 25% lower risk of depression,” the study authors said. Adobe Stock

Exercise also has a host of physical benefits that can make you feel better overall by decreasing muscle tension, improving sleep quality, and reducing anxiety, she notes.So which workouts fight depression best? “To date, the strongest evidence seems to support aerobic exercise,” says Dr. Muzina. This includes running, swimming, walking, hiking, aerobics classes, dancing, cross-country skiing, and kickboxing.According to the Mayo Clinic, engaging in at least 30 minutes of exercise on three to five days of the week could significantly lessen depressive symptoms.

Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿



More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 


Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/exercise," Research suggests that exercising regularly can boost mental clarity and improve working memory and attention span (24, 25).In addition, exercise has been shown to help reduce cognitive decline in adults over age 50 (26, 27).While regular exercise can provide several general mental health benefits, it can also help relieve the symptoms of some specific mental health conditions, which we will look at in depth below.SummaryThe most commonly experienced, science-backed benefits of physical activity on mental health are reductions in stress, improved self-confidence, improved mood, better sleep quality, sharper memory, and clearer thinking.Exercise and depressionDepression is a common mental health condition worldwide, with about 5% of the global adult population experiencing it in varying degrees (28).The main symptoms are (28):depressed moodloss of interest in previously pleasurable activitieslow self-worthdisrupted sleepthoughts of suicide Regular exercise has been repeatedly shown to help manage symptoms of depression, with the most significant benefits being higher self-esteem, better life satisfaction, and fewer negative thoughts (29).In fact, a 2018 research review found that aerobic exercise in particular can have antidepressant effects (30).Exercise may decrease depressive thoughts by increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, an important protein in your brain that’s responsible for learning and cell growth (31, 32).While aerobic exercise has been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression, any type of exercise — from running to playing basketball or lifting weights — is likely helpful.Exercise and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)ADHD is a common mental health condition (33).People who have ADHD may experience difficulty paying attention, impulsive behavior, and overactivity. The cause is an imbalance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain, primarily dopamine (34).ADHD is often treated with medications to promote concentration and reduce impulsive behavior, but research suggests that exercise can be an excellent complementary treatment for ADHD.Specifically, physical exercise has been shown to help regulate dopamine levels in the brain, improve executive functions, and improve attention in children and adults with ADHD (35, 36, 37). While most studies use aerobic exercise in ADHD interventions, it’s important to incorporate a combination of aerobic (cardio) and resistance training into your exercise routine to maximize the health benefits (38).Exercise and anxietyWhile we all may feel anxious at times, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined as experiencing excessive anxiety or worry most days for at least 6 months.Some common symptoms of GAD are (39):restlessnessfatigueirritabilitysleeplessnessMedications, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and meditation are common treatment methods.One alternative method of managing the symptoms of GAD is regularly engaging in purposeful exercise.In fact, a 2018 research review found exercise to be a viable treatment method for anxiety disorder and concluded that higher intensity exercise was more beneficial than lower intensity regimens (40). Therefore, regular exercise seems to be a viable alternative treatment option for anxiety disorder in combination with prescribed medications.Exercise and bipolar disorderBipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes unusual shifts in mood and energy levels, impacts your ability to concentrate, and may impact your ability to complete everyday tasks (41).This condition in commonly characterized by episodes of depression and mania, although in some cases symptoms are mixed.Traditional treatment methods include mood-stabilizing or antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy.In addition to traditional treatment methods, exercise has been shown to help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder (42). More specifically, regular physical activity may help reduce shifts in mood and promote an improved sense of well-being in people with bipolar disorder (43). Many of the medications commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder list weight gain as a side effect, and regular exercise may also help limit this effect (44).Exercise and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)OCD is a condition that can cause uncontrollable recurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that you feel the urge to repeat over and over (45).Depending on the severity, this disorder can affect all aspects of life, including work, school, and home life.The most common treatment approach is medication — such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) — paired with CBT, a type of psychotherapy that targets specific behaviors.A popular alternative treatment method for OCD is a regimented exercise program.In a 2017 study in 56 adults with OCD, researchers noted a significant reduction in OCD symptoms following a 12-week aerobic exercise program.",While aerobic exercise has been shown to be beneficial in reducing,neutral,"

In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good.

Exercise can improve depressive symptoms in people with depression. However, similar to other treatments, exercise is not a panacea and may not work equally for all. A seminal study by Dunn et al. (30), the Depression Outcomes Study of Exercise, found a response rate of about 40% in depressed people free from other treatments. These results are comparable with more recent data found in the REGASSA trial, the largest study with exercise and depression, which found a response rate of about 50% (31). The remission rate (people who no longer meet criteria for MDD diagnosis) was evaluated in the Treatment with Exercise Augmentation for Depression (TREAD) study (32) using and adapting (16 kilocalories per kilogram of weight spent in exercise per week) the pioneering idea of Andrea Dunn in determining the exercise dose based on the energetic expenditure did find a remission rate of about 28%.",Exercise can improve depressive symptoms,yes,"

One 2018 review of studies found that physical activity — specifically resistance training, like weight-lifting — can reduce symptoms of depression, perhaps even as effectively as conventional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and medication for some people. Other studies have found that virtually any type of workout, from cardio to yoga, can lessen depressive symptoms. It’s still unclear how exercise may achieve these effects, but researchers have theories.

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/managing-anxiety/exercise-stress-and-anxiety," Exercise may improve mental health by helping the brain cope better with stress. In one study, researchers found that those who got regular vigorous exercise were 25 percent less likely to develop depression or an anxiety disorder over the next five years. Exercise as Part of Therapy
According to some studies, regular exercise works as well as medication for some people to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the effects can be long lasting. One vigorous exercise session can help alleviate symptoms for hours, and a regular schedule may significantly reduce them over time. Although exercise has a positive effect for most people, some recent studies show that for some, exercise may not have a positive effect on anxiety or depression or may not make a strong impact on long-term mental health. Like all forms of therapy, the effect can vary: Some people may respond positively, others may find it doesn’t improve their mood much, and some may experience only a modest short-term benefit.",One vigorous exercise session can help alleviate symptoms for hours,neutral,"

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise," Some researchers suspect exercise alleviates chronic depression by increasing serotonin (the neurotransmitter targeted by antidepressants) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (which supports the growth of neurons). Another theory suggests exercise helps by normalizing sleep, which is known to have protective effects on the brain. There are psychological explanations, too. Exercise may boost a depressed person's outlook by helping him return to meaningful activity and providing a sense of accomplishment. Then there's the fact that a person's responsiveness to stress is moderated by activity.

Can I remove a tick by covering it with Vaseline?,https://www.rocklinranchvet.com/blog/how-to-remove-ticks/," The majority of these are myths and using them for tick removal could actually make the situation worse. Myth 1: Use Petroleum Jelly
Some sources on tick removal suggest that covering the embedded tick with petroleum jelly will suffocate the tick and force it to back out. The fact is, petroleum jelly does not force the tick to back out and may actually cause the tick to release additional toxins into your pet’s body. Myth 2: Use Nail Polish or Polish Remover
Due to its acidic properties, many believe that nail polish or nail polish remover is caustic to ticks and that covering the tick with either of these chemicals will force the tick to back out. The truth is, nail polish and nail polish remover won’t get rid of the tick, can be harmful to your pet’s skin, and may cause chemical burns if applied to your pet’s body.

""Head lice can be removed by applying plenty of any type of hair conditioner to dry hair and then combing to remove live lice and eggs.Patel explains that the conditioner makes it hard for the lice to move and traps them in the teeth of the comb.“It also detangles hair, making combing easier,"" he adds.READ MORE: Pink dyes eight-year-old's daughter's hair, hits out at 'parenting police'The NHS advice says this method should be tried first.It should take approximately 10 minutes to comb short hair, and 20 to 30 minutes for long, frizzy or curly hair.The site advises to continue wet combing on days 1, 5, 9 and 13 to catch any newly hatched head lice before checking again that everyone's hair is free of lice on day 17.If you’ve tried wet combing for 17 days and your child is still not nit-free, the NHS says you should ask a pharmacist for advice.“They may recommend using medicated lotions and sprays,” the site explains.“These kill head lice in all types of hair, and you can buy them from pharmacies, supermarkets or online.”But in recent years there has been concerns that head lice could be becoming immune to certain treatments.Back in 2016, a US study revealed that 98 per cent of head lice have developed a resistance to pyrethrins and permethrins - the active ingredients in most remedies available in pharmacies.Last year, parents were warned there could be a big rise in head lice outbreaks in schools over the winter period.A change in NHS England guidance means GPs are now routinely prevented from prescribing treatment for the parasites, causing the health charity Community Hygiene Concern to predict that low-income families could be hit hardest.AdvertisementTRENDINGSunstarMCWD, Visayan Electric operations now normalSunstar·1 min readSunstarPolice nab ‘drug pusher’ on 2nd attemptSunstar·1 min readSunstar60 more modern jeeps expected to operate in Metro Cebu in JanuarySunstar·1 min readSunstarMan shot dead by ‘kumpare’ over jealousySunstar·1 min readSunstarAteneo de Cebu’s Rommel Rasmo: ‘Bawal ang violence sa Cesafi’Sunstar·2 min readAdvertisementAdvertisementOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions.

Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,https://livewellzone.com/eating-dates-for-iron-deficiency/," Researchers attribute date’s iron-boosting properties to its iron content, as well as to the fact that it contains multiple nutrients that enhance iron absorption and hemoglobin production.To give you a better idea of how dates can improve both iron and hemoglobin levels, here’s a quick overview of some of those studies.1. Dates Improve Iron Deficiency Anemia in Girls Aged Aged 8 to 10A study published in the journal Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics showed that adding dates to the diets of young, iron-deficient girls, improves iron and hemoglobin levels (source).Here’s a summary of what the study entailed, as well as the results:At the start of this study, the mean hematocrit (Hct) was 34.24 g/dL, the mean ferritin (standard measure for iron) was 47.07 μg/dL and the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.19 g/dL.The participants consumed Mazafati dates for 2 months. No other dietary changes were made.After 2 months the girls showed improvements in all categories: mean hematocrit (Hct) was 37.17 g/dL, mean ferritin was 53.98 μg/dL and mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 12.05 g/dL.Dates contain vitamin A, which helps with the synthesis of hemoglobin. Interestingly, some studies and experts state that vitamin A deficiency tends to go along with anemia. And low vitamin A can decrease iron absorption, further contributing to the development of anemia. Furthermore, another report indicates that taking vitamin A and iron together seems to be more effective at preventing iron deficiency, versus taking them individually (1, 2, 3).Vitamin C is also found in dates and it’s known to enhance iron absorption.From a scientific perspective, the results of this study were considered statistically significant.2.",improves iron and hemoglobin levels,neutral,"

Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927593/," Educational dropout and learning disabilities in the early years of schooling may be due to insufficient iron stores, and many mental and behavioral problems in children have been attributed to IDA.10 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of four basic strategies including iron supplementation, appropriate nutrition education, the enrichment of foods with iron compounds, and the control of parasitic and infectious diseases to prevent and control anemia and iron deficiency anemia.11 Lack of knowledge in both nutritional needs and nutritional values of different foods is a major contributor to the prevalence of malnutrition among primary school children and vulnerable groups. Schools as a broad base serve a large population of children and play an important role in the transfer of health information to individuals, families, and society.12 Nutrition education applied should be easily adapted to socio-economic status, dietary habits and locally available traditional food resources.13 Considering the role of nutrition disorder in the prevalence of IDA,14 strategies for nutritional improvement are safe ways to control and prevent micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron.15 Therefore, if IDA is diagnosed early, it can be treated or prevented by modifying the nutritional status and the administration of iron supplements.16Considering the prevalence of IDA and the effect of nutritional education on the prevention and control of it, the use of date fruit can contribute to controlling IDA. Dates (Phoenix dactylifera) are one among the fruits used in the human diet that possess a high nutritional value.17 There are 314 calories in 100 g of date. Ten minerals are reported, the major being selenium, copper, potassium, and magnesium. The consumption of 100 g of dates can provide over 15% of the recommended daily allowance from these minerals.18 In addition, the amount of iron in dates is about 0.3 mg to 10.4 mg per 100 g. Therefore, eating a few dates daily will provide your body’s daily iron. Also, dates contain vitamin C and fiber, which increase iron absorption.19 Yossef et al (2015) found that the use of dates in the treatment of IDA of children is beneficial and the iron content in 100 g of black dates is reported to be 166.5 mg.20 Dates have also been shown to contain other properties that are useful in treatment or prevention of events such as fatigue, reinforcement of kidney, chronic cough, rheumatoid arthritis and back pain, diarrhea, kidney stone, and peptic ulcers.19,21 Dates contain anticancer properties that may also help prevent the disease.22 Dates also serve as a good source of natural antioxidants.23 Dates can improve hemoglobin (Hgb) levels via increasing erythrocyte production.24 It seems that the  prevalence of IDA  is  high  in female students of Zahedan City, Iran,7 and the abundance of dates in this area.25 Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effect of consumption of date fruit on IDA among primary school girl students.26Methods and MaterialsThis was a semi-experimental study.",Dates can improve hemoglobin (Hgb) levels,neutral,"

Zinc is an important nutrient that can be found throughout your body.2 It is good for helping your immune system and metabolic function, and it can help promote wound healing.2 Consuming zinc on a daily basis can help support growth and development during pregnancy and childhood.3 Zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, impaired immune function and delayed growth, so it’s important to include plenty of zinc in your diet.3 The recommended daily zinc intake is around 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women.2
Zinc can be taken as an oral supplement.2 However, your body will usually get enough zinc through a balanced diet.2 Oysters contain the most zinc out of any other food, but red meats and poultry also have significant amounts of zinc.3 Other good sources of zinc include beans, nuts, breakfast cereals and yogurt.3
Does Zinc Help with Colds
Unfortunately, there is no cure for the common cold, which means the virus has to run its course.1 Despite there being no cure, zinc can be useful in managing a cold to help you while you recover. Research shows that taking zinc at the first sign of cold symptoms can significantly reduce both the severity and duration of symptoms.4 Taking zinc may help prevent the rhinovirus (or cold virus) from multiplying and may stop the virus from lodging in the mucous membranes of the nose and throat.5 Symptoms you may experience with the common cold include sneezing, runny nose, cough and sore throat, so remember to increase your zinc intake at the first sign of these conditions.1 Taking zinc in the form of a lozenge or syrup may be the most effective methods for helping colds because they allow the substance to stay in the throat and come in contact with the virus.5
What Are Some Risks with Taking Zinc Supplements for Colds? Like many other supplements and medicines, side effects can occur after taking zinc supplements for colds. Zinc lozenges can cause side effects like nausea or a bad taste in your mouth.5 Taking large amounts of zinc can lead to zinc toxicity and cause vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps and headaches.3 Permanent loss of smell is a possible side effect from using zinc nasal sprays, so make sure to avoid using them to help your cold.5 Zinc is also known to cause interactions with some types of medications.",there is no cure,no,"

New Study Reveals Zinc Really Might Help Treat a Cold, But There's a Catch

Health01 November 2021By Carly Cassella 

 
(benjaminec/Getty Images) 



In 1771, the German physician Hieronymus David Gaubius introduced the western scientific community to ""a medication with many promises"" – zinc.More than 200 years later, we can find it amongst the many supplements on pharmacy shelves. It's even known to be one of the rare things that might help fight off a common cold. Or does it? Evidence for zinc supplement use is limited, study results have been mixed, and dosage, formulation and length of prescription have not been investigated properly to date.A new meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials has now strengthened the notion that supplementing zinc could prevent symptoms and shorten the duration of viral respiratory infections, like the common cold or the flu. ""It is commonly thought that zinc's role in preventing and treating infections is only for people who are zinc deficient; our findings really challenge this notion,"" says integrative medicine doctor Jennifer Hunter from Western Sydney University in Australia. ""The two large trials from China found very low dose zinc nasal spray reduced the risk of clinical illness.","

Zinc inhibits replication of the virus and has been tested in trials for treatment of the common cold. This review identified 18 randomised controlled trials, enrolling 1781 participants of all age groups, comparing zinc with placebo (no zinc). We found that zinc (lozenges or syrup) reduces the average duration of the common cold in healthy people, when taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. In people taking zinc their cold symptoms are also less likely to persist beyond seven days of treatment.

However, the evidence of benefit was limited to adults, and even in this patient group, uncertainty remained about its clinical benefit. Although oral zinc treatment may attenuate the symptoms of the common cold, large high-quality trials enrolling adults and children are needed. Future trials should be designed to maximize the tolerable doses of bioavailable zinc with a balanced consideration toward potential dose-related adverse effects. Until further evidence becomes available, there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend zinc for the treatment of the common cold. The questionable benefits must be balanced against the potential adverse effects.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Elizabeth Uleryk for providing invaluable feedback on the literature search.",Although oral zinc treatment may attenuate the symptoms of the common cold,yes,"

Can zinc help treat the common cold?,https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/569/274127," Zinc treatment had no effect on the severity or duration of cold symptoms, nor did it have an effect on the proportion of infected volunteers who developed clinical colds [46].Non—influenza-related viral respiratory tract infections in the United States represent a total economic impact of $40 billion annually, spread over the 500 million colds contracted annually [47]. The seemingly benign common cold represents an economic cost far greater than that of many other clinical conditions [47] and warrants continued research designed to reduce incidence and morbidity. After 20 years of research on the use of zinc to treat colds, consensus has not been reached. This review suggests that valid studies are few in number and have not shown zinc lozenges to be an effective treatment for the cold. Acknowledgments

When looking at the many theories surrounding the use of copper bracelets for arthritis, one thing seems to be clear: while the science does not definitively support a link between copper bracelets and reduced pain, many users of copper bracelets report significant pain reduction through their use. It seems that there is widespread hype and genuine support by individuals who have chosen to ignore the nay-sayers and try the bracelets for themselves, many of whom have found exactly what it is they were looking for — mild to strong relief from joint pain.

Copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps fail to help rheumatoid arthritis, says York research
Posted on 16 September 2013
Copper bracelets and magnet wrist straps have no real effect on pain, swelling, or disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis, according to new findings from a study conducted at the University of York. In the first randomised controlled trial to study the effects of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps on rheumatoid arthritis, 70 patients with active symptoms each wore four different devices over a five-month period, reporting on their pain, disability, and medication use throughout the study. Participants also provided blood samples, after wearing each device for five weeks, in order to monitor changes in inflammation. What these findings do tell us is that people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness
Dr Stewart Richmond

The research published in PLOS ONE, show that both the standard magnetic wrist strap and the copper bracelet provided no meaningful therapeutic effects beyond those of a placebo, which was not magnetic and did not contain copper. Dr Stewart Richmond, a Research Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study, said: “It’s a shame that these devices don’t seem to have any genuine benefit.

Hangarter evangelized for copper’s therapeutic possibilities after hearing that copper miners in Finland seldom developed rheumatism while laboring in the copper-rich environment of the mines. In the 1950s, he began treating patients suffering from a variety of rheumatic ailments — including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — with injections of copper in a salicylic acid solution. The results were dramatic: patients showed “rapid and persistent remission of fever, alleviation of pain, [and] increased mobility.”  Hangarter published several papers on his work, and the alternative-medicine movement popularized his ideas.",the marketing of copper bracelets as a treatment,neutral,"

The good news is that athletes foot is easily treated by using creams and powders.

Fungi-static antifungal creams need to be applied for approximately two weeks after the infection has cleared, while fungi-cidal antifungal creams can be stopped once the infection has cleared. Antifungal powders are good for dusting in shoes or socks to kill residual fungal spores and prevent reoccurrence, while corticosteroid creams help reduce itch and inflammation.

The cause of the problem is unknown, but many women believe that rubbing cocoa butter on the skin can help prevent the marks.Although scientific evidence supporting the use of cocoa butter is lacking, many physicians and midwives continue to recommend it.In the present study, Dr. A. H Nassar and colleagues sought to settle this issue by examining the stretch marks that arose in 210 pregnant women who were randomly assigned to apply cocoa butter or inactive “placebo” to their abdomen, breasts, and thighs once daily starting during the first trimester of pregnancy.Eighty-three percent of women completed the study, Nassar, from the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon and colleagues note.Overall, 45 percent of cocoa butter-treated women developed stretch marks compared with 49 percent of women given placebo lotion. Although the percentage is slightly lower in the cocoa butter group, from a statistical standpoint, the difference was not considered significant, meaning that it may have simply arisen by chance.There was also no difference between the groups in the severity of their stretch marks.“Our findings do not support the use of cocoa butter lotion for the prevention of striae gravidarum,” Nassar and colleagues conclude. Further studies, they say, are needed to confirm their findings in other populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of other commonly used products in preventing stretch marks.SOURCE: BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, August 2008.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

  The inability of shea butter and cocoa butter to treat this form of scarring doesn't mean either ingredient isn't sometimes beneficial. While your physician can recommend creams, the Cleveland Clinic doesn't actually specifically recommend shea or cocoa butter to reduce or prevent the appearance of stretch marks. In fact, ointments and creams that assert to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy are of little value, reports the National Institutes of Health.

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,neutral,"

Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018.What did the researchers find?Thirty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e.",whether probiotics prevent AAD,neutral,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/1/e006474," NUTRITION & DIETETICSStrengths and limitations of this studyDiarrhoea due to antibiotic therapy is a common complication. Numerous studies have suggested that specific probiotic supplements can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea but none have examined the use of commercially available probiotic yogurt in children.Often studies have examined diarrhoea as an all or none phenomenon, and not a spectrum of disease. We used the Bristol stool scale as an objective measure of stool frequency and consistency and classified these symptoms at different levels of diarrhoea severity.This study shows that giving children on antibiotics a commercially available yogurt with probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, including diarrhoea. Probiotic yogurt may have additional benefits of providing energy and nutrients that are lacking with probiotic supplements/capsules.IntroductionGastrointestinal (GI) upset is a well-known complication of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially the β-lactams, clindamycin and vancomycin. These antibiotics may affect the function of normal bowel flora, cause overgrowth of unfavourable species such as Staphylococcus, Candida, Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella and Clostridium or cause changes in intestinal mucosa and motility.1 These changes often present as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), which is distressing to both patients and carers and may result in poor compliance with antibiotic therapy.2 The frequency of AAD depends on the definition of diarrhoea and the age of the patient but is estimated to be between 11% and 30% for children on oral antibiotics.3 ,4Probiotics are often recommended on the assumption that ingestion of ‘healthy’ bacteria will reduce the disturbance of gut microbiota and subsequent diarrhoea.5 Like pharmaceuticals, different probiotics exert different actions and have different effects.

Key PointsQuestion 
    What is the efficacy of a multispecies probiotic in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children?Findings 
    In this placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 350 children, a multispecies probiotic had no significant effect on the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile or of unknown etiology, but it reduced the overall risk of diarrhea regardless of the etiology from 32% to 20%, a statistically significant difference.Meaning 
    The use of the studied probiotic formulation may be considered for diarrhea prevention during antibiotic treatment in children. Abstract
                            

Importance 
    The efficacy of multispecies probiotic formulations in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) remains unclear.Objective 
    To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children.Design, Setting, and Participants 
    This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 2018 to May 2021 in a multicenter, mixed setting (inpatients and outpatients). Patients were followed up throughout the intervention period. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months to 18 years, recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, and signed informed consent. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 patients took part in the trial.Interventions 
    A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after.Main Outcomes and Measures 
    The primary outcome was AAD, defined as 3 or more loose or watery stools per day in a 24-hour period, caused either by Clostridioides difficile or of otherwise unexplained etiology, after testing for common diarrheal pathogens. The secondary outcomes included diarrhea regardless of the etiology, diarrhea duration, and predefined diarrhea complications.Results 
    A total of 350 children (192 boys and 158 girls; mean [range] age, 50 [3-212] months) were randomized and 313 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.",The use of the studied probiotic formulation may be considered for diarrhea prevention,neutral,"

Bottom Line
Antibiotic associated diarrhea can be a frustrating and potentially economically disadvantageous adverse effect from antibiotic administration in children, with a reported incidence of around 5% (Wistrom 2001). Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence, as theoretically their ingestion will reduce the disturbanceof normal gut flora, thereby decreasing the incidence of diarrhea (Roberfroid 2010.). We reviewed three trials and one systematic review on this topic, and found that the reviewed studies for the most part demonstrated a reduced incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with probiotics, compared to those treated with placebo (or plain yogurt).

Researchers from the RAND-based Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to find studies that examined whether probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Researchers pooled results from the studies together to gain a clearer understanding of whether probiotics can prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Use of probiotics was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of developing diarrhea when taking antibiotics as compared to not using probiotics. The RAND analysis estimates that 13 people would need to use probiotics in order to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

"
Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-to-eat-antibiotics," These bacteria are collectively known as the gut microbiota.In addition to killing disease-causing bacteria, antibiotics may kill healthy bacteria (3, 4, 5).Taking too many antibiotics can drastically change the amounts and types of bacteria within the gut microbiota, especially in early life (6, 7, 8).In fact, only one week of antibiotics can change the makeup of the gut microbiota for up to a year (9).Some studies have shown that changes to the gut microbiota caused by excessive antibiotic use in early life may even increase the risk of weight gain and obesity (10).Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making them ineffective at killing disease-causing bacteria (11).Finally, by changing the types of bacteria living in the intestines, antibiotics can cause intestinal side effects, including diarrhea (12).Summary: Antibiotics are important for treating infections. However, if overused, they can cause long-term changes to healthy gut bacteria and contribute to liver damage. Take Probiotics During and After TreatmentTaking antibiotics can alter the gut microbiota, which can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially in children.Fortunately, a number of studies have shown that taking probiotics, or live healthy bacteria, can reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (13, 14).One review of 23 studies including nearly 400 children found that taking probiotics at the same time as antibiotics could reduce the risk of diarrhea by more than 50% (15).A larger review of 82 studies including over 11,000 people found similar results in adults, as well as children (16).These studies showed that Lactobacilli and Saccharomyces probiotics were particularly effective.However, given that probiotics are usually bacteria themselves, they can also be killed by antibiotics if taken together. Thus, it is important to take antibiotics and probiotics a few hours apart.Probiotics should also be taken after a course of antibiotics in order to restore some of the healthy bacteria in the intestines that may have been killed.One study showed that probiotics can restore the microbiota to its original state after a disruptive event, such as taking antibiotics (17).If taking probiotics after antibiotics, it may be better to take one that contains a mixture of different species of probiotics, rather than just one.Summary: Taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can reduce the risk of diarrhea, although the two should be taken a few hours apart. Probiotics can also help restore the gut bacteria after antibiotics. Eat Fermented FoodsCertain foods can also help restore the gut microbiota after damage caused by antibiotics.Fermented foods are produced by microbes and include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, kombucha and kimchi, among others.They contain a number of healthy bacterial species, such as Lactobacilli, which can help restore the gut microbiota to a healthy state after antibiotics.Studies have shown that people who eat yogurt or fermented milk have higher amounts of Lactobacilli in their intestines and lower amounts of disease-causing bacteria, such as Enterobacteria and Bilophila wadsworthia (18, 19, 20).Kimchi and fermented soybean milk have similar beneficial effects and can help cultivate healthy bacteria in the gut, such as Bifidobacteria (21, 22).Therefore, eating fermented foods may help improve gut health after taking antibiotics.Other studies have also found that fermented foods may be beneficial during antibiotic treatment.Some of these have shown that taking either normal or probiotic-supplemented yogurt can reduce diarrhea in people taking antibiotics (23, 24, 25).Summary: Fermented foods contain healthy bacteria, including Lactobacilli, which can help restore damage to the microbiota caused by antibiotics.",more than 50%,neutral,"

So which ones can help, and when?Kids and DiarrheaSome of the best proof that probiotics work comes from studies of diarrhea in children, especially when it's caused by rotavirus. Probiotics might cut bouts of infectious diarrhea by half a day to about 2 days.Some research shows that the bacteria strains most likely to help are Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, although other strains might be useful. A mix of a few different probiotics may also treat this type of diarrhea.Diarrhea From AntibioticsAntibiotics kill the germs in your body that make you sick, but they also kill some of the good bacteria.

( ACR Guidelines-Guidelines for Medical Management of OA of the knee) However, many patients eventually require NSAIDs or more potent analgesics to control pain. 2) Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been an important treatment for the symptoms of OA for a very long time. The mechanism by which NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects is via inhibition of the prostaglandin-generating enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX) . In addition to their inflammatory potential, prostaglandins also contribute to important homeostatic functions, such as maintenance of the gastric lining, renal blood flow, and platelet aggregation. Reduction of prostaglandin levels in these organs can result in the well-recognized side effects of traditional non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naprosyn, indomethacin) – that is, gastric ulceration, renal insufficiency, and prolonged bleeding time.",many patients eventually require NSAIDs,neutral,"

How It Works
Acetaminophen is an analgesic, which
		  helps relieve pain. (Analgesics do not affect inflammation as nonsteroidal
		  anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, do.) Why It Is Used
Doctors use acetaminophen to treat
		  mild to moderate pain caused by
		  
osteoarthritis
. If acetaminophen does not
		  relieve pain, or if joint tissue shows signs of inflammation, NSAIDs may be
		  used. How Well It Works
Regular use of acetaminophen can
		  provide relief of mild to moderate pain caused by osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen does not appear to work quite as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
		  drugs for osteoarthritis.",helps relieve pain,neutral,"

Does Tylenol manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,https://www.orlandohealth.com/content-hub/tylenol-is-not-effective-treatment-for-arthritis-pain," According to the Arthritis Foundation, about 50 percent of adults will develop osteoarthritis in their knee at some point in their lives, while 25 percent will develop symptoms in their hips by the time they are 85. Common symptoms include pain, stiffness and swelling, which is why many people seek over-the-counter medications to manage the condition. But as the study suggests, Tylenol isn’t the best option. Acetaminophen isn’t meant to treat inflammation. These drugs treat various aches (headache, muscle ache and toothache) and reduce fever, but they aren’t anti-inflammatory. Acetaminophen pain relievers also can damage your liver if they are overused.",Tylenol isn’t the best option,neutral,"

Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it? Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling. It is not clear which type is best to use or which causes more side effects: high doses of acetaminophen may cause stomach problems, such as ulcers, and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems.",acetaminophen,neutral,"

However, scientists don’t know exactly how it works to relieve pain. It is thought that this drug increases the body’s pain threshold so that pain is actually felt less.

Music can relax you, bring back memories of certain times in your life or bring a smile to your face. Research shows a clear link between health and music: music therapy can be used to help combat depression and heal trauma, and listening to music has been shown to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease stress levels. Before the Hartford Symphony Orchestra concert Friday evening, Javeed Sukhera, MD, PhD, chair of psychiatry, Institute of Living, spoke about the history of the IOL and how music can be used for healing. The conversation with HSO Music Director Carolyn Kuan included a candid discussion about depression. The concerts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by the IOL, featured the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, legendary artists who endured lifelong struggles with depression.",music therapy can be used to help combat depression and heal trauma,yes,"

Music therapy seems to be beneficial also for anxiety (low‐quality evidence), which is often a comorbidity of depression. Severely depressed individuals often experience impairment in maintaining relationships and work engagements. In this regard, evidence suggests significant amelioration in the level of functioning among those who attended music therapy sessions (low‐quality evidence). Improvements in depressive symptoms and functioning are likely interrelated: Mitigation of depressive symptoms may lead to better outcomes in the socio‐occupational sphere, and vice versa. In fact, positive effects might help support motivation as well as emotional and relational competencies of people affected by depression, from adolescents to older adults.","cliniciansMusic therapy, when added to treatment as usual",neutral,"

In receptive music therapy, the patient listens to live or recorded music that their therapist recommends/ selects for them to best address their needs. Receptive music therapy has also shown to be effective in easing anxiety issues in patients undergoing surgery. In active music therapy, the patients actually participate in the process of creating music. This is typically done by having the patient learn to sing or play an instrument.

Can music therapy help manage depression?,https://www.mindbody7.com/news/2018/1/10/can-music-help-in-treating-depression," In fact, review of nine studies involving more than 400 participants found that music therapy was effective in ""decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals."" Another recent study conducted by researchers at Bournemouth University, explored the effects of music therapy in treating depression among children and adolescents. Results showed that those who received music therapy in addition to talk therapy had substantially improved self-esteem and significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to the children who received treatment without music therapy. Those in the music therapy cycle also showed improvement in communication, social function, and interactive skills.Psychiatrist Michael Crawford highlights several reasons that may explain why music therapy can be effective. He states that, ""first, it provides a sense of meaningfulness and pleasure—music is an aesthetic experience that draws in the otherwise passive patient; second, this kind of therapy engages the body and gets people moving—the physical participation averts depression; and finally, it is relational, in that music helps us engage, communicate, and interact with others.

Benefits may go beyond mental health. A small pilot study published in July 2016 in Indian Journal of Palliative Care suggests that, in addition to standard palliative care, music therapy is effective in reducing pain in cancer patients with moderate to severe pain.Music therapy (and art therapy in general) is an emerging field.

Studies have shown that music therapy can be an effective component of depression treatment. According to the research cited, the use of music therapy was most beneficial to people with depression when it was combined with the usual treatments (such as antidepressants and psychotherapy). When used in combination with other forms of treatment, music therapy may also help reduce obsessive thoughts, depression, and anxiety in people with OCD. In 2016, researchers conducted a feasibility study that explored how music therapy could be combined with CBT to treat depression.

randomised trial of music therapy specifically for depression and the results
suggest that it can improve the mood and global functioning of people with this
disorder. Among the challenges involved in evaluating complex interventions such as music
therapy are those associated with treatment fidelity. Erkkilä et
al have addressed this issue by ensuring that the music therapists who
delivered treatment all completed an extensive induction focused on ensuring
fidelity, and videotaped their sessions with participants to monitor adherence. The attention to fidelity is borne out in results that do not vary between
therapists. This suggests that the agent of change is not likely to be the
personality of the therapist or the nature of the particular therapist-patient
alliance (as highlighted by the common factors approach, for example Messer & Wampold

Can music therapy help manage depression?,https://evolvetreatment.com/blog/music-treat-depression/," The answer to our thesis question “Can Music Help Treat Depression?”  is simple:
“Yes.”
The Power of Music
One interesting thing about the meta-analysis we’re discussing is the broad, inclusive definition used by the study authors as to what constitutes music treatment. Most people have heard of Music Therapy, which is a specific type of therapy that uses music in a clinical setting to treat people with emotional or behavioral disorders. You can get an undergraduate or graduate degree in Music Therapy, then become a music therapist. But in this meta-analysis, music treatment included more than Music Therapy delivered by a degreed and licensed music therapist. Whereas Music Therapy is officially defined as follows:
“The clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.”
The authors of the meta-analysis defined music treatment as:
“Implementation of acoustic stimuli (“music”) as a medium for the purpose of improving symptoms in a defined group of participants (patients) suffering from depression.”
This is a big deal because it means music can help treat people with depression whether it’s delivered by a credentialed music therapist or not. The 43% reduction in depressive symptoms seen over all 28 studies and 1,810 included people who received official music therapy, people who listened to music passively, people who listened to music and then composed lyrics, people who played instruments, and people who played drums.",Yes.”,neutral,"

For settings with limited resources or those that have no access to the services of a trained music therapist, music medicine by listening to music of older adult's own preference for >60 minutes per week should be considered as an alternative approach. If a music intervention is deemed appropriate for older adults, we encourage clinician and caregivers to consider our findings when deciding music interventions protocol to achieve the best outcome on depression.ContributorsTD updated the search, undertook study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analysis.

Can music therapy help manage depression?,https://www.altaloma.com/treating-depression-with-music-therapy/," Most people enjoy recorded or live music but don’t know that treating depression with music therapy is possible. Many mood disorders and other mental health conditions respond positively to programs involving the creative arts, such as music and art therapy.

Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings.

What Is Music Therapy?6 Health Benefits of Music TherapyHow to Find a Reputable Music Therapist

It’s believed that music has been used since practically the beginning of time to help humans deal with difficult feelings and better connect to one another. Because of its strong and immediate influence over our emotions, coupled with its ability to naturally increase neurochemicals — including “feel good” endorphins — music is now being added to many rehabilitation programs across the world. Music therapy (MT), also commonly referred to as active music therapy or passive music therapy in many studies, has shown promise for improving both motor control and emotional functions in patients with a wide range of diseases or disabilities. From cases of schizophrenia to Parkinson’s disease, musical interventions seem to help naturally decrease symptoms like anxiety or depression, help ignite creativity, improve communications between patients and their caregivers, and much more.",musical interventions seem to help naturally decrease symptoms,neutral,"

And in human studies, researchers have repeatedly discovered associations between omega-3 fatty acid levels and symptoms of psychosis, depression, impulsivity and self-harm. Emerging research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can be used therapeutically in borderline personality disorder. In treatment studies, researchers rely on just two omega-3 components: EPA and DHA. Silvio Bellino and colleagues from the University of Turin in Italy showed that EPA (1200 mg per day) plus DHA (800 mg per day), when added to therapeutic doses of Depakote, reduced impulsivity, anger, and self-harm in a group of patients with borderline personality disorder. In a separate study from Harvard University, Mary Zanarini and Frances Frankenburg showed that an 8-week course of treatment with EPA (1000 mg per day) outperformed placebo treatment in reducing depression and aggression in women with borderline personality.",omega-3 fatty acids can be used therapeutically,neutral,"

These results are consistent with the findings of recent reports concerning omega-3 fatty acids as an effective adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder (3) and recurrent depression (4). However, the results of the current study extend these findings by suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe cases of borderline personality disorder.The main limitations of this study are that only women were studied and all subjects were moderately ill. Whether similar results would be found for male subjects or subjects with a more severe symptom picture is unknown.Studies assessing different doses of E-EPA for longer periods of time in larger samples are needed.TABLE 1Enlarge tableReceived April 3, 2002; revision received Aug. 8, 2002; accepted Sept. 5, 2002.

This sample was small and only included women, which means the results can not be generalized to an entire population. However, it does begin painting a picture of how omega-3 may benefit borderline patients. Omega-3 is used to treat symptoms, not a particular disease. This can be both positive and negative in mental health care.. By only treating symptoms, omega-3 is not targeting the root causes of a disease and therefore cannot be a cure.

There is no reason to believe that an EPA-only formulation is necessary, as long as a full 1200 mg of EPA plus DHA or a full 1000 mg of an EPA-only fish oil product is consumed daily.

PUFAs a Promising Add-On for Borderline Personality Disorder


Batya Swift Yasgur, MA, LSW
July 26, 2021









Marine omega-3 fatty acids may be a promising add-on therapy for improving symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), new research suggests. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials showed that adjunctive omega-3 fatty polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) significantly reduced overall BPD symptom severity, particularly affect dysregulation and impulsive behavior. ""Given the mechanisms of action and beneficial side effect profile, this [analysis] suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could be considered as add-on treatment"" for patients with BPD, senior author Roel J. T. Mocking MD, PhD, resident in psychiatry and postdoctoral researcher at Academisch Medisch Centrum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, told Medscape Medical News. The findings were published online recently in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Urgent Need 
""There are several effective treatments, but not all patients respond sufficiently,"" which points to an urgent need for additional treatment options, Mocking said. He noted that although ""several prior studies showed promising effects of omega-3 fatty acids"" for patients with BPD, those studies were relatively small, which precluded more definitive overall conclusions.",Marine omega-3 fatty acids may be a promising add-on therapy,neutral,"

Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20030117/fish-oil-soothes-personality-disorder," Borderline personality disorder is a mental condition in which a person's personality becomes skewed and marked by periods of moodiness and impulsive aggression. Researchers say that treatment of the disorder with currently available medications provides only modest results. But studies have shown that populations that eat larger amounts of seafood tend to have lower rates of mental disorders linked to personality disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depression. This prompted researchers to investigate whether increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish would have any effect on symptoms. The study, published in the January 2003 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, compared the effects of daily fish oil supplementation (one gram of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or E-EPA) in 20 adult women with moderate borderline personality with 10 women who were given a placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, women who took the supplements had significantly diminished aggression as well as a drop in the severity of depression compared with the placebo group.",increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids,neutral,"

The omega-3s have also been proposed to alleviate or prevent other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit disorder. However, there is still not enough evidence to recommend the omega-3s in these conditions. What dose of omega-3s is beneficial? Doses for depression range from less than 1 g/day to 10 g/day, but most studies use doses between 1 and 2 g/day. In my practice, I recommend 1 to 2 g/day of an EPA+DHA combination, with at least 60% EPA, for major depression.",there is still not enough evidence,neutral,"

In the 2003 study the author cited, Zanarini et al1 concluded “E-EPA [ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid] is a nutriceutical agent that is both well tolerated and may be efficacious for the treatment of moderately disturbed women with borderline personality disorder. Ninety percent of those taking this compound were able to complete the entire 8-week trial and reported no clinically relevant side effects. Those treated with this compound also experienced a significantly greater reduction in their overall aggression as well as their depressive symptoms than those treated with placebo.” These results suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective monotherapy for women with moderately severe BPD.

In 2015, the authors of one study noticed a correlation between very low magnesium levels and the symptoms of BPD. Other research looked at the potential benefits of higher levels of magnesium, folate, and zinc in women with depression and anxiety. A study published in 2017 also recommended supplementing with magnesium for the treatment of depression.Some interesting research published in 2021 looked at low magnesium levels in children with “callous-unemotional” (CU) traits. The article suggests that nutritional supplementation or diets higher in magnesium  “…could improve CU traits in children.”Sources of magnesium: Epsom salt baths, leafy greens, dark chocolate or cacao, avocados, and salmon. Magnesium-supplemented products such as Natural Vitality Calm (and magnesium gummies) may also reduce insomnia when taken before bedtime.• Vitamin C: Vitamin C may also be beneficial in treating individuals with BPD whose symptoms are manifested through anxiety, restlessness, or nervous energy.",Supplementing with foods higher in Omega 3 may help reduce some of the behaviors,neutral,"

                                Introduction
                            


As of 2018, an estimated 5.5 million children in the US had asthma, a major cause of health care utilization and costs.1 In 2018, asthma exacerbations led to more than 546 000 emergency department (ED) visits and 80 000 hospitalizations.1 
Several observational studies have linked low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (henceforth, “vitamin D”) levels to severe asthma exacerbations, lower lung function, and reduced response to corticosteroids.2-5 Such findings may be explained by immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, including regulatory T-cell induction, attenuation of Th2 and Th17 responses, enhancement of IL-10 production, and inhibition of airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and collagen deposition.6-9 Vitamin D may attenuate viral-induced asthma attacks by reducing rhinovirus replication in bronchial epithelium, promoting interferon-mediated antiviral pathways and inducing production of antimicrobial peptides.10,11 
Quiz Ref IDA meta-analysis of clinical trials using participant-level data showed that vitamin D3 supplementation was associated with lower risk of asthma exacerbations, but the pooled estimate was not significant among children younger than 16 years old.12 More recently, a comprehensive review of vitamin D3 for the prevention of wheeze attacks found insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D3 supplementation in children.13 Previous pediatric randomized clinical trials, however, have not focused on children with low vitamin D levels or who are at high risk for severe asthma exacerbations. Moreover, existing trials did not monitor vitamin D levels or did not show consistently improved levels after supplementation. Children with a recent severe asthma exacerbation are at highest risk for subsequent exacerbations, independent of disease severity, treatment, or control.14 The primary hypothesis for this trial was that supplementation with vitamin D3 would improve the time to a severe exacerbation in high-risk children, aged 6 to 16 years, with vitamin D insufficiency and taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma. The secondary hypotheses were that this protective effect would result from reduced incidence of viral-induced exacerbations or enhanced response to corticosteroids.

High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults. The study participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting the broad range of global geographic settings, involving Canada, India, Japan, Poland, the UK, and the US. The majority of people recruited to the studies had mild to moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma.",it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections,neutral,"

Seven included 435 children and two included 658 adults. They concluded that vitamin D is:Likely to reduce both the risk of asthma attack and health care use. But these findings were generally limited to only those with mild or moderate asthma. It also only looked at those with lower baseline vitamin D levels.Children and people with frequent severe asthma attacks were under-represented. More primary trials are needed to see if vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks in these groups.What Does This Mean for People With Asthma?If you have asthma, you may want to speak with your asthma care provider about checking your vitamin D levels.",Likely to reduce both the risk of asthma attack and health care use,neutral,"

Through the analysis of 8 high-quality RCTs (16, 17, 20–25), we directly compared the influences of vitamin D and placebos on the treatment for childhood asthma, and this is the first meta-analysis based on RCTs exploring the effects and safety of vitamin D supplementation on childhood asthma. Our meta-analysis provides the latest clinical evidence that vitamin D supplementation can significantly enhance serum vitamin D levels, which fails to improve asthma control for pediatric patients. However, vitamin D supplementation may reduce patients' lung function. Regarding vitamin D toxicity, the pooled outcomes showed similar results between the two groups in the form of AEs.

There continues to be interest and research into the potential role of Vitamin D in asthma management and prevention. A 2016 review of nine previous double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled trials of Vitamin D in children and adults with asthma, found Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations but did not improve lung function or day to day asthma symptoms. [ii] However, more research is needed to understand whether these effects are for all patients or only those with low Vitamin D levels to start with, implications for people with severe asthma, and the dose that is required. Asthma Australia are proud to be funding research investigating Vitamin D levels during pregnancy and the impact on the respiratory outcomes of the infants.

We have not shown a benefit of vitamin D on day-to-day asthma control,” Martineau said. The number of asthma patients with uncontrolled symptoms is significant. “[The disease in] over 50 percent of all asthma patients [is] not well-controlled, which results in symptoms like coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. In fact, in a recent survey we found that over 80 percent of patients limited simple activities like household chores and exercise at least once per week due to asthma,” Winders said.

Our results may encourage other researchers to investigate if there is a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and asthma. Also, further studies are required to investigate if vitamin D supplementation may improve asthma symptoms, general weakness, and musculoskeletal pain in patients with asthma.In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in the both participants with asthma and healthy controls, but serum levels of 25(OH)D among participants with asthma were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In addition, vitamin D deficiency symptoms including general weakness, musculoskeletal pain, and anxiety were highly prevalent among participants with asthma compared to healthy controls.

Bolus supplementation with vitamin D in adults did not reduce asthma exacerbations in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (10). So our golden bullet is not looking so great.A further loss of luster comes from the study in this issue of the Journal by Denlinger and colleagues (pp. 634–641), in which they report on the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on URIs in individuals with asthma (15). Their article outlines a prearranged secondary analysis of the recent VIDA (Vitamin D Add-on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Asthma) trial (16), in which adults with mild to moderate symptomatic asthma and baseline vitamin D insufficiency were randomly assigned to daily vitamin D3 or placebo for 28 weeks in conjunction with tapering of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses. In the earlier report, vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce rates of first asthma treatment failures (16).In the current report (15), vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce the severity of URI symptoms, nor did it alter the overall rate of symptomatic URIs.",did not reduce asthma exacerbations,neutral,"

Does the use of vitamin D improve asthma symptoms and reduce asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid treatment? Evidence-Based Answer




Despite the authors' caution that further data are needed to clarify the role of vitamin D in care, this Cochrane review found that its use reduces the average number of asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid treatment from 0.44 to 0.28 per person per year. It also decreases the risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbation from 6% per year to around 3% per year.1 (Strength of Recommendation: A, based on high-quality evidence.) Vitamin D has no effect on asthma symptom control as measured by the Asthma Control Test or on lung function as measured by predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).1 (Strength of Recommendation: A, based on high-quality evidence.)",Does the use of vitamin D improve asthma symptoms,yes,"

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.consultant360.com/exclusives/vitamin-d-supplementation-may-improve-asthma-control," Vitamin D supplementation did not, however, affect the risk for adverse events, nor did it improve lung function or everyday asthma symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath. “Meta-analysis of a modest number of trials in people with predominantly mild to moderate asthma suggests that vitamin D is likely to reduce both the risk of severe asthma exacerbation and healthcare use,” the researchers concluded. “It is as yet unclear whether these effects are confined to people with lower baseline vitamin D status; further research, including individual patient data meta-analysis of existing datasets, is needed to clarify this issue. Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.”

This study is aimed at finding whether vitamin D supplementation could affect asthma treatment or not. The result of studies has shown that adding vitamin D3 supplementation to inhaled corticosteroids as an asthma treatment had no significant effect on the time to develop severe asthma and on asthma morbidity. Also, the effect of prenatal vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation on preventing asthma or recurrent wheezing through 3 years of age yet the statistical difference was not significant. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the aspects of this vitamin effect on asthma development and management.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.ReferencesA.

Therefore, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (3, 10). On the other hand, experts agree that soy formula is the most appropriate choice for full-term babies with galactosemia or hereditary lactase deficiency — two medical conditions that prevent babies from breaking down the natural sugars in cow’s milk (1, 2).

Soy formula is not recommended unless a baby has a rare health condition or a family is strictly vegetarian or vegan. In addition, soy formula is not recommended for some specific situations. Avoid soy baby formula for:



Colic or fussiness, since the switch will likely not be helpful
A cow's milk protein allergy, because many infants who have a cow's milk allergy are also allergic to soy proteins and would benefit more from drinking an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula instead
A high risk for food allergies, since soy is among the most common allergens
Premature babies, since soy formula can lead to decreased bone mineralization, even when babies are given supplemental calcium



Unless there is a good reason to start your baby on soy formula, if you stop breastfeeding before your baby is 12 months old or need to supplement, it is best to start with a cow's milk-based formula rather than soy formula. Health and Hype of the Latest Baby Formula Trends

Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,https://www.allergy.org.au/hp/papers/infant-feeding-and-allergy-prevention," There is no consistent evidence that breastfeeding is effective for the prevention of allergic disease. However, breastfeeding is recommended for the many benefits it provides to mother and infant. Breastfeeding during the period that solid foods are first introduced to infants from around six months may help reduce the risk of the infant developing allergies, although evidence for this is low. If breastfeeding is not possible, a standard cow's milk based formula can be given. There is no evidence that soy or goat's milk formula reduce the risk of allergic disease when used in preference to standard cow's milk based formula. Based on a recently published review of studies, there is no consistent convincing evidence to support a protective role for partially hydrolysed formulas (usually labelled 'HA' or Hypoallergenic) or extensively hydrolysed formulas for the prevention of eczema, food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis in infants or children.",no evidence that soy or goat's milk formula reduce the risk of allergic disease,neutral,"

Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergic disease in infants 

Review questionDoes feeding infants with a formula containing hydrolysed protein result in decreased risk of developing allergic disease such as asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever and food allergy during infancy and childhood?BackgroundAllergic disease is responsible for a substantial health burden among infants, children and adults. Early dietary intake may influence the development of allergic disease. When babies are not exclusively breast fed, use of hydrolysed formula instead of ordinary cow's milk formula may reduce allergic disease among babies and children, although additional studies are needed to confirm this. Infant formulas have been designed to lower the chance of infants developing allergic disease. These include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy milk formulas. Hydrolysed formulas break down milk proteins into smaller, potentially less allergy-producing proteins.ResultsThis review of trials found no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease in preference to exclusive breast feeding.",no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula to prevent allergic disease,neutral,"

Adgent, MSPH, PhD, formerly of NIEHS, now at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Adgent said, “Modern soy formula has been used safely for decades. However, our observational study found subtle effects in estrogen-responsive tissues in soy-fed infants, and we don’t know if these differences are associated with long-term health effects.”
Some mothers who don’t breastfeed have long used soy formula as an alternative to cow-milk formula, often from concerns about milk allergies, lactose intolerance, or other feeding difficulties. However, soy protein contains high amounts of genistein, an estrogen-like compound. Like other estrogen-mimicking chemicals found in the environment, genistein can alter the body’s endocrine system and potentially interfere with normal hormonal development. In laboratory studies genistein causes abnormal reproductive development and function in rodents, but little is known about its effects on infants.",if these differences are associated with long-term health effects,neutral,"

In this case soy formulas may seem like a good alternative. However, up to half the infants who have milk allergy are also sensitive to soy protein, and thus must be given specialized formula (such as amino-based or elemental) or breast milk. Vegetarian & vegan concernsSome strict vegetarian and vegan parents choose to use soy formula because it contains no animal products.

Systematic reviews draw evidence-based conclusions about medical practice after considering both the content and quality of existing trials on a topic.The Cochrane reviewers analysed three studies that compared formulas for prolonged infant feeding. The enrollment size of each was considered small — with the combined number of infants totaling 875. Reviewers did not include studies of infants already diagnosed with food allergies or food intolerances; instead, review studies evaluated infants considered at high risk of allergies based on a strong family history — infants whose parent or sibling had ever had a significant allergy. The studies followed these infants into childhood up to 10 years of age to determine if they had developed allergies or intolerances.Based on the results, the authors concluded there was no significant benefit from the use of a soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula.The review supported previous evidence that mothers who choose to only breastfeed their infants for at least six months do reduce the incidence of allergy.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, women who don't have health problems should ""exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least the first six months of life."" Breast milk provides the right balance of nutrients to help an infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and some of the nutrients in breast milk also help protect against some common childhood illnesses and infections.Despite these benefits, many mothers still introduce their babies to cow's milk or soy milk formula, which some nutritionists believe may not be an acceptable substitution.",some nutritionists believe may not be an acceptable substitution,no,"

Also significant was the percentage of subjects who lost between 5 and 10 % of body weight after 90 days compared to placebo group (32.4 and 3.3 %, respectively). Although some studies demonstrated that reduction in body weight by administration of chitosan can be achieved in individuals given a hypocaloric or standardized diet [14, 29], other studies show efficacy of chitosan for persons without diet restrictions [10, 23, 30, 31]. The results of our study confirm that indeed significant weight loss can be achieved in subjects adhering to a non-restrictive diet [10, 23, 30, 31]. Reasons for the difference in results in our study with other reported studies could be difference in diets, dosage and timing of chitosan administration or protocol variability such as life style recommendations.One factor which is important to consider is the timing of chitosan ingestion before meals.

Studies with animals were very promising, but when it came to human trials the evidence was not as strong. There are some studies that suggest the use of Chitosan with a calorie restricted diet may cause slightly more weight loss than groups which did not take Chitosan throughout the research. This effect, however, was not achieved without a calorie restricted diet, so it is important to understand that adding this ingredient to your routine with a goal of weight loss will be ineffective if you do not have a calorie restricted diet and exercise plan in place, and even if you do add Chitosan into your nutritional plan, the additional weight loss attributed to it may be slight, although considered statistically significant in some trials and insignificant in others.

Does chitosan help lose body weight?,https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/weight-loss-supplements," ChitosanHow it works: Chitosan is a sugar mainly derived from the outer skeletons of crustaceans. According to Sopczak, it is said to turn into a gel-like substance in the stomach which then binds to fat in the intestines, but evidence of this is inconclusive.What the research says: A 2018 review of 14 trials totaling 1,101 overweight or obese subjects found chitosan supplements slightly reduced body weight — by about 2.23 pounds — in overweight and obese people. Overall effectiveness: According to the NIH, chitosan does not bind to nearly enough fat to result in significant weight loss.Side effects: Chitosan is generally considered safe, but Sopczak says possible side effects include upset stomach, nausea, bloating, and constipation. ChromiumHow it works: The mineral chromium is believed to increase lean muscle mass while reducing body fat. It also helps insulin perform properly, which Sopczak says helps the body process carbs, fat, and protein more effectively.What the research says: A 2013 review of nine trials with a total of 622 participants found overweight and obese adults who took chromium picolinate (a supplemental form of chromium) lost an average of about 2.4 pounds after 12 to 16 weeks.",does not bind to nearly enough fat to result in significant weight loss,no,"

Some trials reported no cholesterol-lowering effect of chitosan compared with placebo33, 34 while another reported an effect for chitosan at 4 weeks but no further effect at 12 weeks.35The Cochrane meta-analysis found a statistically significant but clinically insignificant effect for chitosan on body weight (−1.7 kg; 95% CI = −2.1 to −1.3 kg).1 Positive, small changes in fasting blood glucose and blood pressure were also noted.1 The clinical importance of the effect has also been questioned by other reviewers.36, 37Other studies report on the effect of chitosan on fat absorption, again with conflicting results38, 39, 40 with some researchers suggesting a gender-specific response.39The 2017 joint position statement of the Italian Society of Diabetology (ISD) and the Italian Society for the Study of Arteriosclerosis (ISSA) on nutraceuticals for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia strongly recommends the use of fiber (ie, oat beta-glucan, chitosan, glucomannan, guar gum, HPMC, pectin, psyllium) to lower low-density lipoprotein in the general population that fails to increase dietary fiber; in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and low to moderate cardiovascular risk; or in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome (Level I, Strength A).69HemostasisBandages impregnated with chitosan and chitosan granules have been approved by the FDA for use in emergency settings to control blood loss.41 Experiments conducted in pigs41 and in the emergency department42 have shown that topical application of chitosan granules controls bleeding in less than 3 minutes, where pressure alone failed.42 Suggested mechanisms of action include mucoadhesion, platelet activation, vasoconstriction, and ionic action on red blood cells.41, 42Chitosan's characteristic as a film-forming and protective polysaccharide suggests a potential role in wound healing and burns. Its applications in this area have been investigated.43, 44, 45, 46Metabolic syndrome/PrediabetesIn a randomized, double-blind intervention trial (n = 51) in Koreans with prediabetes, 12-week supplementation with chitosan (1,500 mg/day) resulted in statistically significantly improved blood glucose at 30 and 60 minutes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), change in body fat percentage, and waist circumference compared with the placebo group. No significant differences were noted between groups in the level of change of inflammatory biomarkers (ie, interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha). No adverse reactions were observed.68Other usesChitosan (0.1% solution) has been effectively used as an alternative for sodium hyaluronate in long-term, postsurgical ophthalmic management (3 years).47Chitosan 2 g added to an oxalate-rich meal had no effect on urinary oxalate excretion, despite oxalate being negatively charged.48 An antioxidant effect of chitosan has been demonstrated in vitro.49Application of chitosan in the pharmaceutical industry is documented. Its ability to mask bitter tastes in oral pharmaceuticals has been reported.50 There are numerous reports of chitosan being employed in various types of drug delivery systems, including intranasal, transdermal, and site-specific delivery mechanisms, as well as in hydrogels, microspheres, liposomes, matrix forms, and conjugate forms.51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63Dosing
Chitosan has been administered in cholesterol reduction and weight loss clinical studies in wide-ranging doses of 0.24 to 15 g daily (median, 3.7 g/day) for 4 to 24 weeks.1, 33, 34, 35 Chitosan has been administered to patients with renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis without any apparent adverse events.64Chitosan has also been administered to prediabetic patients for glucose control at a dose of 1,500 mg/day.68A chitosan 0.1% solution has been used in ophthalmology47 while 1% w/w solutions have been used as a mouthwash.19 Chewing gums releasing 2% w/v in saliva have been used in dental studies.20, 21Pregnancy / Lactation

Walking: Bone and joint specialists suggest that walking is one of the best forms of exercise for hip arthritis. Walking boosts blood flow to your cartilage, giving it the nutrients necessary to provide cushion to the ends of your joints. Start out with 20 to 30 minutes at a time, three to five times a week, then gradually increase the time and frequency to build up your endurance.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/antioxidant-supplements-do-not-improve-male-fertility-nih-study-suggests," Antioxidant supplements are commercially available to help treat male infertility, but research on its effects on semen quality and rates of pregnancy and live birth are limited. The new study reports on results from the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility Trial (MOXI), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted at nine sites across the United States. The study enrolled 171 couples where the male partner had at least one abnormal reading on an analysis evaluating sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality; the female partners had normal fertility test results. Men received a placebo or an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins C, E and D, selenium, l-carnitine, zinc, folic acid and lycopene for at least three months and up to six months.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6456381/," An estimated 48.5 million couples worldwide are infertile,1 and approximately 40%–50% percent of cases are attributed to female factors.2,3 Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are a cornerstone of infertility treatment, with more than 600,000 cycles performed each year in North America and Europe alone.4–6 Nevertheless, success rates remain relatively low; in 2015 in the US, approximately only one of three ART cycles started with the intention to transfer an embryo resulted in a live birth.4 It is thus of vital importance to identify potentially modifiable predictors of treatment outcome, including diet.7Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress impairs gamete and embryo development during ART.8 In addition, infertile women have been reported to have a lower total antioxidant status.9,10 It has thus been suggested that antioxidant supplements may improve infertility treatment outcomes with ART.11 However, high intake of some vitamins, such as vitamin A, may result in adverse reproductive outcomes.12,13 Furthermore, the relation between micronutrients and ART outcomes may not necessarily be linear.14While several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have addressed this question, their findings are inconsistent. A 2017 Cochrane review of RCTs concluded that antioxidant supplementation during the course of infertility treatment showed limited benefit for increasing the probability of pregnancy or live birth and that, among women undergoing ART specifically, antioxidants were not associated with an increased live birth rate.11 However, as acknowledged by the authors, this evidence suffers from multiple important gaps. First, few trials reported effects of the intervention on live birth rates. In addition, few of the trials included in the meta-analysis tested the same intervention and estimated pooled data from interventions as dissimilar as multiple micronutrient blends (including proprietary blends whose composition cannot be established) to selected combinations of specific micronutrients at considerably different doses, to interventions of substances without direct antioxidant potential. These issues make it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the effects–or lack thereof–of antioxidants on ART outcomes. A particularly important gap to move the field forward is to identify which specific antioxidants and at which doses may offer benefit to inform the design of new trials.",It has thus been suggested that antioxidant supplements may improve infertility treatment outcomes with ART,neutral,"

The researchers analysed data from 28 trials involving a total of 3,548 women attending fertility clinics. Antioxidants did not increase the women's chances of conceiving or having a baby. The results show no significant increase in women becoming pregnant when taking antioxidants compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid. ""There is no evidence in this review that suggests taking an antioxidant is beneficial for women who are trying to conceive,"" said lead researcher, Marian Showell, who works in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.

Review question
        Do supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile men? Background
        A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. Many subfertile men undergoing fertility treatment also take dietary supplements in the hope of improving their fertility. Fertility treatment can be a very stressful time for men and their partners. It is important that these couples have access to high-certainty evidence that will allow them to make informed decisions on whether to take a supplemental antioxidant.",improve fertility outcomes,neutral,"

There are a lot of different antioxidants including well-known ones like vitamins C and E. Many botanical antioxidants also exist. Researchers have performed antioxidant studies and found antioxidants can improve fertility for both men and women by fighting free radicals. When choosing natural antioxidant remedies for fertility, it’s best to look for a supplement that has well-researched ingredients. Ideally, to cover all the bases, you should try to boost both male and female fertility with specially formulated supplements. It’s also essential to choose antioxidant supplements that have been studied not to interfere with drugs used to stimulate and regulate hormones.",antioxidants can improve fertility for both men and women,neutral,"

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.givelegacy.com/resources/antioxidants-male-fertility/," Since we know that antioxidants are good at reducing oxidative stress, which antioxidants are best for promoting male fertility?Best antioxidants for male fertilityAccording to Dr. Ghayda, several antioxidants are beneficial for male fertility, including coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, and selenium. ""However, the most important one is coenzyme Q10, which has the highest level of evidence and highest research studies behind it,"" he advises. So, let's begin with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).CoQ10A study published in the International Journal of Reproductive Biomedicine showed the seminal concentration of CoQ10 is linked to key semen parameters such as sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. This is because the total antioxidant capacity, or the ability of your body to neutralize free radicals, improves when supplementing with CoQ10. Several studies concur that supplementing with CoQ10 may improve sperm quality and concentration. A 2020 review concluded that CoQ10 has a profound effect on sperm motility.","coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, and selenium",neutral,"

A Cochrane review of 50 clinical trials found low quality evidence that antioxidants may be associated with an increased live birth rate of around 25-40%. While the review couldn’t find associations for every antioxidant studied, they did find an association between CoQ10 and increased pregnancy rates. Antioxidants have also been shown to improve live birth rate for couples undergoing fertility treatment. Another Cochrane systematic review concluded that antioxidant supplementation in men can improve live birth, clinical pregnancy rate, and sperm DNA fragmentation.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/810242," Recently, antioxidants are increasingly used to treat idiopathic male infertility. However, the lack of available evidence has led to the inability to rank the effects of antioxidants on the sperm quality parameters and pregnancy rate of infertile men. This network meta-analysis studied the effects of different antioxidants on the sperm quality and pregnancy rate of idiopathic male infertility.Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio (OR) were applied for the comparison of continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively, with 95% CIs. The outcomes were sperm motility, sperm concentration, sperm morphology, and pregnancy rate.Results: A total of 23 RCTs with 1,917 patients and 10 kids of antioxidants were included.

A new review from New Zealand suggests that there is little to no evidence that supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C, improves women's chances becoming pregnant. The review analyzed data from 28 trials involving a total of 3,548 women many of whom underwent fertility treatment, including taking antioxidant supplements (e.g., vitamins, amino acids and/or omega-3 fatty acids) to try to increase their chances of becoming pregnant (1). The analysis showed that women taking anti-oxidants did not significantly increase their chances of conceiving or having a baby, compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid. Women taking antioxidants exper-ienced no more adverse effects compared to those who received placebos or standard treatment.

Antioxidants have the exact opposite effect. They act as free radical scavengers and decrease the number of reactive oxygen species and associated cellular damage. Therefore, it makes sense that antioxidant supplements are promoted as improving sperm health. But the question remains whether or not antioxidant supplements are really beneficial for male fertility. There are arguments both FOR and AGAINST them…

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.maleinfertilityguide.com/antioxidants-maleinfertility-elevatedspermdnafragmentation," [Henkel R. Andrologia 2019]ConclusionA Cochrane review of the available literature in 2014 found a statistically significant improvement in pregnancy and live birth rates in couples where men were taking a regimen of antioxidants. These findings have been questioned by more recent studies such as the relatively small MOXI trial. Clearly, larger randomized trials which contain all of the supplements felt to potentially beneficial (the MOXI trial did not include L-carnitine) are needed to better elucidate the impact of these therapies on fertility outcomes. Until that time, the majority of evidence seems to point to a potential benefit of antioxidants in the management of male infertility. No specific antioxidant formula has been proven to be more effective than the others in clinical trials. Relatively cost-effective options are available, and the use of basic antioxidants seems to be safe in most men if excessive amounts are not used.APPROACHES TO USING ANTIOXIDANTS IN MENThere 3 main approaches that clinicians can use for antioxidants in managing male infertility: 1) Recommending antioxidants for all men with fertility issues 2) Reserve antioxidants for men who have certain significant risk factors (such as tobacco use or pyospermia) 3) Only use antioxidants if elevated levels of oxidative stress are found upon testing (as discussed above)None of these approaches has been proven superior at this point in time.",better elucidate the impact of these therapies on fertility outcomes,neutral,"
