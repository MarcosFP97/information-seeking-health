Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.donjoyperformance.com/injury/achilles-tendonitis," The achilles tendon connects your heel to your calf and helps with movement and flexing of the foot. Achilles Tendonitis is inflammation of the achilles tendon and is often caused by overuse, increasing activity too quickly, tight calf muscles, or flat feet. If you are injured, the area on the back of your foot above your heel may hurt, your achilles may feel tender or tight, and it might be difficult for you to move your foot. Severe injuries can involve the rupture of your achilles tendon, you might hear and feel a pop when this occurs and you may experience severe pain. Aside from the typical rest, ice, compression and elevation for your foot treatment, wearing a brace to support your achilles tendon and applying a compression sleeve to your calf can help alleviate pain.

Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/brace-for-it-when-to-use-an-ankle-brace," Using ankle braces to prevent ankle injuries is becoming more common, and I’m often asked by coaches, parents and athletes if wearing an ankle brace is worthwhile. Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity. Ankle braces are not shown to reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower extremity injuries. Ankle ligaments, muscle and tendon units and the bones of your ankle create the internal supports to keep your ankle safe. These internal supports are important links from your foot all the way up to your hip for ideal performance. Ankle braces serve as the external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion (movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward),  and provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space.","lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity",neutral,"

Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.medicalbraces.org/ankle-braces-what-you-need-to-know/," Conditions That Typically Require An Ankle Brace
There are two possible needs for the continual use of ankle brace: a high ankle sprain or a knee injury. According to the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society, a high ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments above the ankle that connect the tibia to the fibula. The injury usually happens from twisting and rotating the foot while the ankle is held in position and unable to move freely. Rather than the ankle rolling at the joint, the entire foot twists, which ends up tearing the high-ankle ligaments. Achilles Tendonitis

As you may have inferred from the previous Achilles tendonitis ankle brace talk, shoe inserts for Achilles tendonitis can also be helpful for easing the strain on the Achilles tendon and the pain associated with the formation of any bone spurs as a side effect. These heel pads for Achilles tendonitis lift the heel, diminishing any strain on the Achilles tendon, itself. Compression socks for Achilles tendonitis are another treatment and prevention option.

Will wearing an ankle brace help heal achilles tendonitis?,https://www.fortunatefeet.com/do-heel-lifts-help-achilles-tendonitis/," Wear a brace can help Achilles Tendonitis.Make sure that the shoes you’re wearing provide adequate arch support and that they’re supportive, especially if you use them for activities like running. You should definitely wear supportive Achilles tendonitis sandals as well as supportive slippers.How Long Should I Wear Heel Lifts?Unlike muscles or bones, which have good blood supply, tendons don’t have a great deal of blood supply. This is why Achilles tendonitis can take 12 weeks or more to heal after an injury.When you’re experiencing tendinopathy, you may want to try the heel lifts for a few hours at a time. If you find that you’re comfortable and the pain has eased up while wearing them, then extend the duration that you use them until you can wear them throughout the day.If you haven’t experienced any pain when using the heel lifts for a full day, then you can use them in your shoes for 6 to 12 weeks.However, if your pain increases, then you should stop using them and seek medical advice.How Do Heel Lifts Work?Heel lifts are usually a firm wedge that you place in the back of your shoes for achilles tendonitis to fit under your heel. This increases the height in the heel of the shoe, which then shortens the tendon and reduces the amount of strain that’s placed on it.Even though you may only have Achilles tendonitis in one ankle, you’ll need to place heel lifts in both shoes.This keeps your legs at the same height.",Wear a brace can help Achilles Tendonitis,yes,"

Is a tepid sponge bath a good way to reduce fever in children?,https://www.healthxchange.sg/children/childhood-conditions/fever-remedies-children," The normal body temperature is between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C. With infection or other illnesses, various chemicals are released in our body. This re-adjusts the thermostat, resulting in fever.Fever factsFever is the body's way to fight infection. However, it is not just caused by infections alone.How high a fever it does not indicate the severity of the illness that is causing the fever.Overwrapping and a generally hot environment can cause the body temperature of a child to be slightly above normal.Fever caused by viral infections may persist for up to 5 to 7 days and will only completely settle when the viral fever has resolved.​High fever per se does not cause brain damage, though a small percentage between 6 months to 6 years may have seizures with high fever. However, febrile seizures usually do not lead to brain damage.Fever in children: Home remediesTepid spongingMay help if the temperature is more than 39.5 °C.Use tap or lukewarm water to sponge.Remove clothings, cover the child with towel, sponge and dry his face.Apply the cool compress to forehead, nape of neck, armpits and groin (see diagram).Proceed to sponge body starting with the front then to the back.Generally you should not sponge a child for more than 30 minutes at a stretch.Stop sponging when shivering occurs, or when the child turns blue.When your child shivers, cover him up and wait a while before resuming sponging.Encourage your child to take plenty of fluids.Dress your child in light clothings to allow heat exchange.Keep the room environment cool and well-ventilated to allow the ambient temperature to help bring the fever down.Click on page 2 to read about common fever medications and know when to consult a doctor.​

Can Folic Acid Improve Cognitive Function? Folic acid has be used to treat people suffering from memory loss, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia for some time now. There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:

Improved memory
Better change in cognitive function
Significant difference in information processing 
Change in age-related cognitive issues
Improved mental function in older people

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/9931293," Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people capable of benefiting from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. There is a risk that if folic acid is given to people who have undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12 it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anaemia identical to that of folate deficiency but also causes irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Folic acid will correct the anaemia of vitamin B12 deficiency and so delay diagnosis but will not prevent progression to neurological damage.",whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms,neutral,"

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61211," Diminshing cognitive functions such as deterioration in memory, reduced ability to process information quickly, and reduced verbal fluency have been linked to risk of dementia in old age. Dr Durga and colleagues followed a group of 818 over-50s for three years. Some were given 800 micrograms of a synthetic form of folic acid per day, the rest took a placebo. A synthetic version of the vitamin was used because the naturally occurring form degrades more easily, for example with storage and cooking, and that would make any results less reliable. The scientists found that the group who took the folic acid improved on all aspects of cognitive functioning compared to the group that took the placebo. Folic acid is a water soluble B vitamin and is found in yeast extract, green leafy vegetables, for example spinach, in dried beans and peas, some organ meats such as liver, fortified cereals, certain fruit and vegetables, and certain seeds, for example sunflower seeds.",improved on all aspects of cognitive functioning,neutral,"

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/duct-tape-for-warts," There is older and newer research that seems to demonstrate that duct tape works better for wart treatment than other methods, such as freezing.One 2003 study claims that duct tape is 80 percent effective for speeding up the rate at which warts go away.More clinical research is needed to discover if, and why, duct tape works to get rid of warts. What to know before you use this methodAvoid using duct tape on a wart that is:near your genitalsunder your armpitsclose to one of your mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Plantar warts, which occur on your heels or other parts of your feet, may be more resistant to these treatments because the layers of skin on your feet tend to be more difficult to remove. If you have genital warts, visit a doctor. Human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes topical and genital warts, can be transmitted sexually. Certain strains of HPV are associated with a greater risk of cervical cancer.Since genital warts are transmitted sexually, get tested to see which strain of HPV you have before you try any home treatments for your warts.

We also discuss other ways to remove warts.Does it work?Share on PinterestPeople must use repeated applications of duct tape to remove a wart with this method.Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work for several reasons. One theory is that the tape deprives the skin cells of oxygen. By “suffocating” the wart, the duct tape makes it more likely that the skin cells will die.The process of applying and removing the duct tape may also remove additional skin cells, which can make the wart less bulky and noticeable.However, there is a lack of recent research into using duct tape as a wart removal treatment, and earlier studies have produced mixed results.One 2002 study found that the duct tape method was significantly more effective than cryotherapy, which involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The study included 51 participants ages 3–22.They received either up to six sessions of cryotherapy, which took place every 2–3 weeks, or 2 months of duct tape application. Warts resolved entirely in 85% of the participants in the duct tape group and in 60% of those in the cryotherapy group.However, a 2007 study into using adhesive pads to treat warts found that adding duct tape to a breathable fabric called moleskin made no difference to its effectiveness.",Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work,neutral,"

The results: duct tape won over cryotherapy; 85% of the duct tape patients were wart-free, compared with 60% of the cryotherapy group. In fact, the majority of ""duct-taped warts"" disappeared within 28 days -- while the majority of cryotherapy-treated warts needed two treatments, spaced at least two weeks apart.

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://www.healthtenfold.com/duct-tape-for-warts/," Some research state it helps and some say it’s no better than a placebo effect.Duct tape itself does not “cure” the wart.

This may be painful but it’s less painful than for example freezing method that is also sometimes used for wart removal. So, week after week after repeating the duct tape process you will be “peeling” the wart off your skin.Weather duct tape is effective or not, one thing that is definitely true is that using duct tape on warts helps to prevent the virus from spreading further (warts are caused by human papillomavirus) since duct tape stops the wart from contacting other parts of your skin.When definitely not to try duct tape for warts removalAvoid using duct tape on warts if warts are located in one of the following areas:Close to you mucous membranes (inside your nose or mouth)Under your armpitsNear your genitalsPs!

Its active components contribute to the gradual destruction of pathological cells. In other words, they simply corrode the wart.

Local cooling was continued for several hours, until pain no longer returned when the part was taken out of the bath… This form of treatment has advantages in emergency care for lesser burns, since it is easily available, inexpensive, humane, and promptly effective.”

“is associated with an increase in tissue damage” (Burns, Nov. 2007). The temperature of cold tap water appears to be nearly ideal for use as first aid for a burn (Wound Repair and Regeneration, Sep-Oct. 2008).

Abstract

        The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter. Repigmentation was most evident on sun-exposed areas, where 38% of the patients had previously noted repigmentation during summer months.",folic acid,neutral,"

The results of the study showed that further depigmentation stopped in 64% of the patients; clear repigmentation was observed in 52% and total repigmentation was seen in 6% of the patients. During the study, patients were asked to combine these nutritional supplements with sun exposure during the summer months and UVB lamps during the winter. The results clearly showed that the combination of folic acid, vitamin B12, and UV exposure was more effective than each of the 3 treatment options for vitiligo. How Folic Acid Works for Vitiligo

One way to medically manage vitiligo is through targeted and directed sun exposure or exposure to UV rays, often referred to as light therapy or phototherapy. This is specialized narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) therapy completed under careful supervision in your doctor's office over the course of multiple sessions. It's unsafe to try to approximate its effect on your own. Protecting affected areas from direct sun exposure is a cornerstone of management. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), consistent, daily use of sunscreen is especially important. This involves:

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://www.vitiligo-center.org/en/article/effects-sun-vitiligo-patients," The amount that gives you the right protection is one that gives uniform coverage to all exposed areas (as per manufacturers guidelines 2mg per cm²). You should also understand that choosing a sunscreen product with a higher protection factor does not provide you with constant sun protection and should be re-applied at least every 2 hours or every hour if sweating, swimming, etc. The first layer should be applied 20 minutes before going out in the sun and then re-applied to the face and all exposed parts of the body every 2 hours even if you’re in the city or under cloudy conditions. Finally, in addition to protecting your skin from severe sunburn, sunscreen will help keep areas not affected by vitiligo less dark, thus helping you reduce the contrast between very dark (or sunburned) areas and vitiligo spots - something which could, in turn, trigger the physical-psychological phase of vitiligo development.

   Take Vitamins and Minerals  

Just as there is no agreed-upon “vitiligo diet,” there are no vitamins and minerals that have been found to consistently prevent or reverse the symptoms of vitiligo. However, some limited research suggests that taking certain vitamins and minerals in the form of oral supplements or topical creams may help, including: 



Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 deficiency has been linked to some cases of vitiligo, leading some healthcare providers to suggest taking vitamin B12 supplements in addition to other treatments. Turmeric: In a 2022 pilot study, patients with moderate vitiligo who applied a topical turmeric cream saw a reduction in the size of their white patches over the course of four months. Gingko biloba: A handful of studies have suggested that ginkgo biloba, which acts as an antioxidant, may stop vitiligo from progressing or even lead to repigmentation in some cases. Iron: Research indicates that vitiligo is often associated with iron-deficiency anemia, so iron supplements may be helpful. Copper and zinc: Some healthcare providers recommend taking over-the-counter (OTC) oral copper and/or zinc supplements to improve the symptoms of vitiligo.",taking certain vitamins and minerals in the form of oral supplements or topical creams,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is important in the hematological and nervous systems, and it has a complex relationship with the skin. Altered cobalamin levels can lead to dermatological manifestations, which may indicate a deficiency or excess of this vitamin. The biochemistry and metabolism of cobalamin is complex, and diseases can be associated with alterations of this metabolic pathway. The cutaneous manifestations of cobalamin deficiency include hyperpigmentation (most commonly); hair and nail changes; and oral changes, including glossitis. Additionally, several dermatologic conditions, including vitiligo, aphthous stomatitis, atopic dermatitis, and acne are related to cobalamin excess or deficiency.",Altered cobalamin levels can lead to dermatological manifestations,no,"

Starving a Fever May Really Be an Effective Cure: Eating Well Helps Infection Spread Faster in Water Fleas

Starving a fever really may be an effective cure, according to a new study that revealed plentiful food appeared to accelerate the spread of infections. The new study looked at bacterial infections in water fleas and found that increasing their supply of food can speed up the spread of infection. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh found that when parasite-infected water fleas were well fed, some fleas became highly contagious compared to when food was scarce. Researchers said that the findings, published in the journal Biology Letters, suggest that under certain conditions, some individuals are more likely to spread disease compared to others. Researchers said that the finding could help researchers monitor and control the spread of infections like epidemics in large populations. ""If we have an idea of which individuals transmit a lot of disease, we will be better able to stop its spread,"" researcher Dr. Pedro Vale of the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh said in a statement.",Christine Hsu,neutral,"

Eating food when you have a cold can also help the body generate heat, although other methods of keeping warm, like wearing an extra layer of clothes or wrapping yourself in a blanket, do the trick as well. There are many reasons you shouldn’t try to starve a fever. Fever is part of the immune system’s attempt to combat the virus. Fever raises body temperature, which increases metabolism and burns more calories.

Thankfully, starving is no longer recommended for treating any sickness. Proper nutrition – and even more important, proper hydration – is crucial in preventing and recovering from both fevers and colds.

Is the old adage “feed a cold, starve a fever” true? NorthShore's Robert Mitchell Figura, D.O., puts to rest the truth of this ancient wisdom. The reason people say “feed a cold” is because the body needs energy when it's fighting illness. This applies to both colds and flu, but for different reasons. For a cold, eating healthy food will provide the body the extra energy it needs to fight illness, but can also help the body generate heat. The cold virus replicates faster in a cold environment so raising your body's temperature along with bundling up can stop cold germs in their tracks, said Dr. Figura.",true,neutral,"

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/05/why-feeding-a-cold-and-starving-a-fever-wont-help-you-get-better/," But the modern brain still works much like a caveman’s did.It has also been suggested that not wanting to eat may be an important natural defence mechanism just like a fever, which helps your immune system fight off infections. In fact, if you force-feed mice during an infection they are actually more likely to die than if they only eat what they feel like.These facts have led to the idea that there may have been a semantic shift in the idiom. What we think of as “feed a cold, starve a fever” may originally have been “fede a cold starb o’feber” (fede = “stoke [a fire]”, starb = “die”, feber = “fever”) or “stoke the inflammation of an infection and you die”.But while starving (in the short term) can keep a feverish mouse alive, this may have little relevance to an innocuous cold.Most times grown-ups get a cold they don’t even get a temperature. Adults generally save fevers for bugs they’ve never seen before or severe infections, like influenza.So you have a sore throat and a runny nose, but no fever or cough from the beginning, you’re probably just coming down with a common cold. And so you may just as well feed (during) your cold, and save your starving for the fever. For kids all bugs are new, so fevers are commonplace.",helps your immune system fight off infections,neutral,"

When it comes to cancer, can selenium supplements help? Past research on the topic has had conflicting results, while recent research suggests that they may do more harm than good. (2)
What the research tells us
In the past, studies showed that taking selenium as a supplement helped prevent people from getting cancer. However, a more recent systematic review suggests that this might not be true. This review looked at many different types of cancer – including head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, skin, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and blood cancer – and found no evidence that selenium supplements reduced cancer risk.

Yes, selenium can help prevent and fight cancer.But you must be careful to get the dosage right. As with other minerals, selenium is found in the soil. Thus, selenium levels reflect the ground in which plants were grown for food and the plants that cattle eat. As a result, there are marked regional variations in environmental selenium levels. In high selenium areas there’s a risk of developing selenium toxicity, which may lead to deformities of bones and teeth and other health problems.","Yes, selenium can help prevent and fight cancer",yes,"

(iStock)There is no convincing evidence that taking high doses of selenium -- a popular dietary supplement -- can prevent cancer, according to a new review.Selenium is a mineral that is essential for humans, and is also present in soil and rocks.While daily selenium recommendations from the United States and World Health Organization vary between 30 and 55 micrograms per day for adults, the authors note, companies that sell the supplements claim that higher doses have a range of health benefits, including cancer prevention.However, ""we still do not have an exact picture of what selenium is doing to human health,"" Dr. Marco Vinceti, one of the authors of the new review from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy, told Reuters Health.To try to get a better focus on that picture for cancer in particular, Vinceti and his colleagues analyzed 55 studies on the link between selenium and different types of cancer.Most of those were so-called ""observational studies"" -- scientists measured how much selenium people ate every day or how much they had in their blood or toenails, then tracked who got cancer over the next few years.The remaining 6 studies were done through more rigorous trials, in which researchers randomly divided participants into one group that took selenium supplements for a month or more, and another that took a drug-free placebo pill or nothing -- then followed them for cancer. These kinds of studies are thought to be better at accounting for outside factors that may affect cancer risk.The observational studies suggested that talking selenium may be linked to a slightly lower risk of cancer -- more so in men than women.But in the randomized trials, people assigned to take selenium at doses at least four times higher than the daily recommendation were not less likely to get cancer -- prostate cancer and skin cancer, in particular -- than those not taking selenium.And some of those trials raised the question of whether high doses of selenium might be dangerous, such as by increasing the risk of diabetes.The review is published in the Cochrane Library, a publication of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. ""If you put it all together, it's not a good story for patients,"" Dr. Neil Fleshner, a researcher at University Health Network in Toronto who has studied the effect of selenium on prostate cancer risk, told Reuters Health.He said it's still possible that selenium may help prevent cancer over a very long time period, or that certain kinds of selenium might work while others don't. But right now, ""there's no good evidence at all that selenium is beneficial,"" said Fleshner, who was not involved in the review.James Marshall, of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, said that the excitement about selenium began with evidence that animals or people with very low selenium in their diet are at an increased risk for cancer.While those individuals might benefit from a selenium supplement, that's where the mineral's anti-cancer effects appear to end.",selenium may help prevent cancer over a very long time period,neutral,"

Treating Cysts with Birth Control
While there are a handful of methods of treating ovarian cysts, including laparoscopy (a type of surgery), if a woman's body frequently forms functional cysts, it is common for doctors to prescribe the birth control pill. The reason? To prevent the patient from ovulating. No ovulation means a much lower possibility of developing functional cysts, since they are directly related to ovulation.

Hormonal contraception affects primarily the appearance and development of cysts formed as a result of hormonal disorders. So hormonal birth control for ovarian cyst treatment can be used only in case of functional cysts. As you know, ovarian follicular cyst occurs when the ovarian follicle, which is formed during each menstrual cycle, is not destroyed and the egg can’t be released from it. In the case of the so-called corpus luteum cyst, there is another situation. After the rupture of the follicle and the exit of the egg from it, a yellow body is formed. If during the menstrual cycle the woman has not got pregnant, the corpus luteum usually disappears.",can be used only in case of functional cysts,neutral,"

Oral contraceptives have long been known to be highly effective at suppressing the development of ovarian cysts. In one study, the relative risk of developing ovarian cysts was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.39) for women taking an oral contraceptive compared with those not taking an oral contraceptive.1 Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts, the authors sought to clarify whether this is appropriate. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Although the studies were too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analyses for most questions, results from these studies were consistent enough to draw several conclusions. Five trials looked at spontaneously occurring ovarian cysts, representing a combined total of 398 women. The largest study included 141 women, and four of the studies were conducted in Turkey.",Although oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat ovarian cysts,neutral,"

        Abstract


BACKGROUND: 
Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. OBJECTIVES: 
This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. SEARCH STRATEGY: 
We searched the databases of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, and EMBASE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP).",birth control pills could be used to treat cysts,neutral,"

Treating Cysts with Birth Control
While there are a handful of methods of treating ovarian cysts, including laparoscopy (a type of surgery), if a woman's body frequently forms functional cysts, it is common for doctors to prescribe the birth control pill. The reason? To prevent the patient from ovulating. No ovulation means a much lower possibility of developing functional cysts, since they are directly related to ovulation. A similar option is the hormonal contraceptive injection Depo-Provera. Ultimately, a woman can't do anything on her own to prevent the development of ovarian cysts.",To prevent the patient from ovulating,neutral,"

Also, leavened grain-based products have more zinc than unleavened products. Vitamin C and Zinc Limits

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://prenate.com/the-importance-of-zinc-during-pregnancy/," Zinc plays a role in everyday bodily functions, and is essential during pregnancy. For expecting moms, it’s important to understand the effects that zinc and healthy prenatal nutrition have on positive pregnancy outcomes. The Need for Zinc
Immune function, wound healing, cell division and DNA synthesis all involve zinc metabolism.1 Zinc also plays a role in the development of the placenta, which makes it an essential micronutrient in pregnancy. A deficiency of zinc can impact the function and formation of the placenta, which may lead to negative pregnancy outcomes.2
Zinc Deficiency
Because of a higher need for zinc during pregnancy and lactation, expecting and new mothers are at an increased risk of zinc deficiency.1 A recent study2 found that:

Moderate maternal zinc deficiencies impair fetal growth
Maternal zinc deficiencies impact the placental morphology
Transport of iron through the placenta is reduced by zinc deficiency
Zinc deficiency may impact oxidative stress in the placenta
Maternal zinc deficiencies alter maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and
lactation
Maternal zinc deficiencies alter immunological in late gestation

Nutritional Support for Mothers & Babies
Our bodies do not have a specialized storage system for zinc.1 Therefore it is important that we intake zinc daily. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration, pregnancy and lactating mothers should get 15 mg of zinc daily.3 The following are food sources that can help expecting mothers meeting their recommended daily intake of zinc:1

Beef chuck roast
Pork chop or pork loin
Breakfast cereals fortified with zinc
Swiss, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses (make sure cheeses are pasteurized)
Almonds and cashews
Peas

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://nihrecord.nih.gov/2020/01/24/zinc-folic-acid-supplement-does-not-improve-male-fertility," Dietary supplements containing zinc and folic acid—marketed as a treatment for male infertility—do not appear to improve pregnancy rates, sperm counts or sperm function, according to a study by NICHD. The study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The authors note that most so-called fertility supplements contain zinc and folic acid. Zinc is an essential mineral for sperm formation, and folate, the natural form of folic acid, depends on zinc to help form DNA in the sperm. Previous studies of these nutrients as a treatment for male infertility have produced conflicting results. In the current trial, researchers enrolled 2,370 couples planning infertility treatments in 4 U.S. cities and their surrounding areas.",do not appear to improve pregnancy rates,no,"

Can evening primrose oil help treat eczema?,https://www.healthline.com/health/evening-primrose-oil-for-eczema," If you’ve ever dealt with eczema, you know how uncomfortable it can be. The most common course of treatment is easing symptoms, often with herbal supplements, such as evening primrose oil. Evening primrose oil is also a treatment for psoriasis and acne. It’s been linked to treatment for arthritis, osteoporosis, breast pain, diabetic neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms. The United Kingdom once approved evening primrose oil for eczema and breast pain treatment, but they revoked the license in 2002 due to insufficient evidence that it works. Today, there’s conflicting evidence that it is effective for treating eczema.The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine lists it as ineffective for treating eczema when taken orally, and a 2013 study found it to be no more effective than placebo pills.",there’s conflicting evidence that it is effective for treating eczema,neutral,"

In general, an ankle brace keeps your foot and toes pointed forward and prevents inward rotation or twisting of the foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains (stretching and tearing of ligaments, tendons, and other soft tissue) occur with sudden twisting or rotation of the ankle joint as you step off a curb or stair, or run on a bumpy, uneven surface. When an ankle injury occurs, coaches, primary care physicians, orthopaedic specialists, and podiatrists often advise patients to wear ankle braces for joint support and to prevent further injury. Bracing also limits the development of scar tissue and arthritis and reduces both acute and chronic pain. An ankle brace is an adjunctive tool after casting, surgery, physical therapy, exercise, targeted training, and other kinds of medical interventions. Your podiatrist in South Texas may advise an ankle brace in these situations:

Ankle fracture
Hindfoot fracture
Ankle sprain and repeated ankle sprains
Ankle instability due to arthritis, sprains, and obesity

Ankle ligaments, muscle and tendon units, and the bones of your ankle, create the internal supports to keep your ankle safe. These internal supports are important links from your foot to your hip, allowing for ideal performance. Ankle braces serve as the external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion (movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward),  and provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space. Jacobson says for maximum effectiveness, ankle braces should fit comfortably in the shoes you wear during an activity, which also helps with brace use compliance. “After experiencing an ankle injury, it’s important to consider rehabilitation as part of your treatment plan,” adds Jacobson. “Often, when an athlete is still having ankle pain or isn’t back to full function, it’s because he or she hasn’t allowed for enough time to properly heal.”

Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture?,https://raleighboneandjoint.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-for-an-ankle-fracture-recovery/," Numbness or tingling are other telltale signs of a fracture.But the bottom line is that the only way to tell for certain is to have an X-ray and be examined by one of our orthopedic physicians. This is crucial to have a successful ankle fracture recovery.What Happens If a Broken Ankle Goes Untreated?If your ankle has been fractured and you do not get medical attention, it can lead to long-term consequences. The main concerns are that it could cause a nonunion or a delayed union.A nonunion occurs when the broken bone fails to heal.By comparison, a delayed union fracture does eventually heal, but it takes much longer than is typical.Failure to get timely treatment could cause foot deformities that can interfere with walking, running or even completing daily tasks. You’re also at a higher risk of developing an infection or arthritis if you delay with your ankle fracture recovery.What Kind of Surgeries Are Used for a Broken Ankle?First, it’s important to realize that you may not need surgery to treat your broken ankle at all. In fact, at the Raleigh Bone and Joint Surgery Clinic, we always implement conservative approaches to treatment. That means we will only consider surgery if it is absolutely necessary.If surgery is needed, one of the most common procedures to help a fractured ankle is an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).During  an ORIF, the pieces of your bone are repositioned so that they are properly aligned and then physically reconnected, usually involving screws, rods, plates or even surgical nails.",the only way to tell for certain is to have an X-ray,neutral,"

Can magnesium help prevent migraine?,https://herbs-plants.com/can-magnesium-help-with-headaches-and-migraines/," How can magnesium be used for headaches and migraines? Can magnesium be used for headaches during pregnancy? And finally what are the potential risks and side effects of magnesium?I- What Is Magnesium?Magnesium is a mineral involved in many functions of the body in children and adults.Magnesium helps reduce fatigue and assists in the normal functioning of the nervous system.It is also involved in normal psychological functions such as concentration, reasoning, and memory.In general, we find up to 24 g of magnesium in the body, of which approximately 65% is stored in the bones, which represent a reservoir that can be mobilized in part when needed.A certain amount of magnesium is also found in the muscles and certain organs such as the liver, the heart, and the kidneys.II- Can Magnesium Help with Headaches and MigrainesMagnesium is very important to preserve the nervous and muscular balance and to relieve many ailments.Thus, it helps to reduce fatigue and stress, which are two of the factors that can trigger a migraine.During migraine attacks, the level of magnesium in the blood and cells often drops.During a particularly severe and long-lasting attack, a single infusion of magnesium can stop the migraine permanently.In addition, sufficient magnesium intake effectively reduces the frequency and intensity of migraines.# How to Use Magnesium for Migraines and HeadachesMagnesium plays a very important role in the calcium channels that regulate the vasoconstriction of the vessels.If you have migraines, take regular courses of magnesium chloride as a preventive measure.In case of migraine or headaches, taking 1 glass of magnesium chloride solution can relieve you.In addition, the Dead Sea salt bath, which contains 46% magnesium chloride, is also well known for relieving headaches.Taking magnesium as a preventive measure during attacks, at a rate of 300 to 600 mg per day, could reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.# How Does Magnesium Prevent Migraine?Migraines are painful and frequent, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Magnesium consumption can solve this problem.Some studies suggest that magnesium can prevent and help treat migraines.In addition, a one-gram supplement of magnesium can relieve an acute migraine attack faster and more effectively than a common medication.Magnesium-rich foods can also help reduce migraine symptoms.Magnesium plays an essential role in brain function and mood, and low levels are linked to an increased risk of depression.# Primary and Secondary HypomagnesemiaHypomagnesemia is a serum magnesium concentration below 1.8 mg/dl (< 0.70 mmol/L). The causes are inadequate magnesium intake and absorption.They are associated with neurological signs including generalized convulsions, tetany, and muscle spasms. Treatment is based on an adequate intake of magnesium.# Magnesium in Migraine PathogenesisMagnesium is a very important intracellular element involved in many cellular functions.However, magnesium deficiency can play a very important role in the pathogenesis of migraine by promoting cortical expansion depression.These magnesium deficiencies may also cause impaired neurotransmitter release and platelet hyper aggregation.Given the multifaceted role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of migraine, the use of magnesium in the treatment of acute and preventive headaches is a simple, inexpensive, safe, and well-tolerated option.Studies have shown that treating acute headaches with intravenous or oral magnesium can be effective, particularly in certain patient subgroups.# Magnesium in the BodyMagnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in the body.",Some studies suggest that magnesium can prevent and help treat migraines,yes,"

There is strong evidence that magnesium deficiency is much more prevalent in migraine sufferers than in healthy controls. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have produced mixed results, most likely because both magnesium deficient and non-deficient patients were included in these trials. This is akin to giving cyanocobalamine in a blinded fashion to a group of people with peripheral neuropathy without regard to their cyanocobalamine levels.

    The importance of exercise when you have diabetes



February 3, 2021



For people who have diabetes—or almost any other disease, for that matter—the benefits of exercise can't be overstated. Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:

Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes.",Exercise helps control weight,neutral,"

We can’t stress this enough: everyone’s diabetes is different. Goals of an exercise program may be to reduce or come off of medications, to lose weight, or just to increase physical fitness and decrease the risk of future disease. In general, exercise increases the body’s sensitivity to insulin, making it easier for the muscles to use the glucose in the blood. This has different implications for everyone, making it very important to understand how exercise and diabetes are connected in order to pursue your goals safely. Below are some things to consider for active type 1 and type 2 diabetics:

Type 1 Diabetes:

For people with type 1 diabetes, making adjustments to the amount of insulin you take or carbohydrates you eat may be needed before, during, and/or after exercise. Because every body reacts differently, individual people will have different strategies to maintain glycemic control while leading an active lifestyle.",exercise increases the body’s sensitivity to insulin,neutral,"

So not only does eating a nutritious diet and getting enough physical activity help manage blood sugar if you already have type 2 diabetes, but it can also aid in weight loss and high cholesterol — issues often closely tied to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Also, a major clinical study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases observed individuals at risk for diabetes for three years and found that including 150 minutes of exercise a week decreased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. This means sticking to physical activity and a nutritious diet may not only help you avoid or reverse a type 2 diabetes diagnosis now but in the future as well.Exercise: Begin with the basicsWhile diet can sometimes be tailored for you by a doctor or nutritionist (i.e., you can’t tolerate gluten, you prefer low carb, if you are a vegan, etc. ), the kind of exercise that works for evading or managing type 2 diabetes is a bit broader.Essentially: All exercise counts!

It increases insulin sensitivity, which helps the cells use any available insulin to take up glucose from the blood. Also, when muscle cells contract during exercise, they are able to take in glucose even when insulin is unavailable. The blood glucose-lowering effects of exercise last up to about 24 hours following a workout.Although all exercise helps counter the effects of diabetes by promoting weight loss and increasing insulin sensitivity, the specific types below provide additional advantages:Aerobic exercise: Regular aerobic training lowers blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and A1C test results, which provide the average blood glucose level of the past 2–3 months. Research has linked moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise to substantially lower cardiovascular and overall death risks in people with diabetes.Resistance exercise: Diabetes is a risk factor for poor muscle strength.

Regardless of the type of diabetes you have, regular physical activity is important for your overall health and wellness. With type 1 diabetes, it’s very important to balance your insulin doses with the food you eat and the activity that you do—even when you are doing house or yard work. Planning ahead and knowing how your blood sugar and body respond to exercise can help you keep your blood sugar from going too low or too high. Preventing lows 
Your blood sugar response to exercise will vary depending on:
your blood sugar level before you start
the intensity of the activity
the length of time you are active
the changes you’ve made to insulin doses
Sometimes people experience a drop in blood sugar during or after exercise, so it is very important to check your blood sugar, plan ahead, and be prepared to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). To learn how different types of activity affect you, you should check your blood sugar before, during and after an exercise session.

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.cochrane.org/CD008118/HTN_fermented-milk-for-hypertension," Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods ►



Fermented milk for hypertension 

High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure. Authors' conclusions: 

The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure.",The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure,neutral,"
no

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://studyfinds.org/yogurt-fermented-milk-high-blood-pressure/," That’s in addition to a person’s genetics and the environment they live in. However, healthy bacteria and organic proteins present in certain fermented milks could control this microbiota and therefore help to reduce high blood pressure. “New evidence suggests that antihypertensive fermented milks, including probiotics, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides obtained from milk fermented with specific lactic acid bacteria, may modulate gut microbiota,” Dr. Vallejo-Córdoba reports. “Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milks with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects.”
The researchers say they will need to perform more studies to understand the antihypertensive effects of fermented milks. High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and is one of the leading causes of death globally. Healthy gut bacteria influences intestinal development, barrier integrity and function, body metabolism, the immune system, and the central nervous system.",healthy bacteria and organic proteins present in certain fermented milks could control this microbiota,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Previous studies have suggested that probiotic fermented milk may possess blood pressure (BP)-lowering properties. In the present study, we aimed to systematically examine the effect of probiotic fermented milk on BP by conducting a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. PubMed, Cochrane library and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to March 2012 to identify eligible studies.The reference lists of the obtained articles were also reviewed. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate the combined treatment effect. Meta-analysis of fourteen randomised placebo-controlled trials involving 702 participants showed that probiotic fermented milk, compared with placebo, produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg (95% CI 24·64, 21·56) in systolic BP and 1·09 mmHg (95% CI 22·11, 20·06) in diastolic BP. Subgroup analyses suggested a slightly greater effect on systolic BP in hypertensive participants than in normotensive ones (23·98 v. 22·09 mmHg).",produced a significant reduction of 3·10 mmHg,neutral,"

Can dupixent treat eczema?,https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-eczema-drug-dupixent," Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. “FDA’s approval of Dupixent demonstrates our commitment to approving new and innovative therapies for patients with skin disease,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Eczema can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available to patients, including those patients whose disease is not controlled by topical therapies.”
Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as “eczema,” which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy.",Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids,neutral,"

However, none of these prior studies looked specifically at online yoga programs for people with this condition, until now.The new study involved 212 people with knee osteoarthritis. All participants had access to online information about osteoarthritis, treatment options, and the benefits of physical activity, weight loss, and healthy sleep habits.Researchers randomly assigned around half of the people to do a 12-week self-paced online yoga program.The program consisted of a series of 12 pre-recorded 30-minute videos. People were asked to do one video a week, three times during the week.The classes included a slow-paced mix of static and dynamic yoga poses designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles of the core and legs.

By then, both groups had similar levels of physical function, pain, knee stiffness, and quality of life.This loss of benefits seen in the yoga group may be because many people stopped doing the yoga classes after the 12-week program ended.During the last week of the course, over two-thirds of participants completed at least two classes a week.",improve pain,neutral,"

Numerous studies confirm that in addition to lessening pain and improving function and mobility, yoga provides important psychological benefits. 6 Reasons to Practice Yoga to Relieve Arthritis Pain
1. Improve Flexibility and Range of Motion (ROM)

Loss of coordination and muscle strength frequently accompany a limited range of motion (ROM). Part of the reason for this is that when muscles aren’t used they become weak and stiff. Over time underutilized muscles begin to atrophy, leading to even greater motion limitations.",Numerous studies confirm that in addition to lessening pain and improving function and mobility,neutral,"

Although this study is unique in that it looked at the impact of yoga on biomarkers, it is not the first study to examine the impact of yoga on RA. Several older studies have found that yoga has both physical and psychological benefits for people with RA, including reduced pain, improved function, and better mental health.

Studies indicate that sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, is effective in treating acute migraine attacks. The mechanism of sumatriptan's therapeutic action is not completely understood. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that sumatriptan constricts dural vessels and inhibits neuropeptide release from trigeminal nerve endings by activating 5-HT1 receptors.

Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults 

Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people, the main feature is a painful, and often disabling, headache. Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting. Migraine affects about 1 person in 8, mainly women, and mainly in the age range of 30 to 50 years.Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It can be given by four different routes: by mouth (oral), by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), by nasal spray (intranasal), and by suppositories (rectal). Separate Cochrane reviews for each of these routes provided information on how well sumatriptan worked at reducing headache pain in over 50,000 people with migraine.",It can be given by four different routes,neutral,"

We believe that the results of this study are applicable to day-to-day general medical practice, since the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population (Table 1) were similar to those of most patients with migraine.21,22 The only exceptions may be that the entry criteria, study design, and study setting (treatment in the clinic) would tend to select patients with more severe and more frequent attacks and that patients with serious concomitant diseases were excluded. The efficacy of sumatriptan compared very favorably with that of other drugs used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.6 7 8,23 Furthermore, unlike other antimigraine drugs, such as ergotamine, that are considered to be effective only if given early in an attack,7,8 sumatriptan was also effective when given late. In addition, sumatriptan was well tolerated. Adverse events were mostly minor and transient, and the incidence and severity were not dose-related. A few patients had minor electrocardiographic changes, but the incidence of these was the same in the groups given sumatriptan and that given only placebo.",The efficacy,neutral,"

Ubrelvy and Imitrex are both oral tablets used to treat migraine, but there are differences in the way they work. Ubrelvy prevents a protein called CGRP thought to play a role in migraine attacks from binding to its receptor and Imitrex is thought to bind to serotonin 5‑HT1B/1D receptors, and inhibit pro-inflammatory substances. Although no head-to-head comparison trials compare Ubrelvy to Imitrex (sumatriptan), indirect evidence suggests that overall, Ubrelvy is no more effective, and may be inferior to Imitrex at relieving migraine in adults who are able to tolerate triptans. For those adults with moderate-to-severe migraine attacks that cannot tolerate triptans or who have found them ineffective, Ubrelvy is beneficial for treating migraines compared to no treatment.",Ubrelvy is no more effective,neutral,"

Headaches happen when the nerve endings in different parts of your head and neck become irritated. There are many different kinds of headaches that occur for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most common:
Tension headache
Dull pressure or tightness on both sides of the head and sometimes the neck
Can last anywhere from half an hour to a whole week

Migraine
Throbbing on one or both sides of the head
Can range from moderate to severe pain
Usually lasts 4-72 hours
Can cause additional symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sounds
Exact cause isn’t entirely understood, but environmental factors and genetics may contribute
Triggers include stress, changes in sleep patterns, certain foods and food additives (like the sweetener aspartame), certain types of medications, and hormonal changes in women

Does Aleve relieve migraine headaches?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3886154/," Patients were assessed at monthly intervals for changes in the severity and duration of headache, premonitory symptoms (mainly visual disturbances) and photophobia, nausea and vomiting associated with migraine attacks that had occurred since the previous visit. Patients were studied for a maximum of ten attacks and significant improvement was observed in the severity and duration of headache when the patients were on naproxen sodium. Also the premonitory symptoms and photophobia improved significantly on naproxen sodium and significantly less rescue analgesics were required. Patients suffering from common migraine had less severe headaches and photophobia when taking naproxen sodium than when taking placebo and the headaches were shorter in duration and patients took less rescue analgesic. No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups in patients with classical migraine. Ten patients in the placebo group and six in the naproxen sodium group reported side-effects but these were possibly related to the use of rescue medication.",naproxen sodium,neutral,"

Acne (Pimples)Acne is a localized skin inflammation as a result of overactivity of oil glands at the
base of hair follicles. This inflammation, depending on its location, can take the form
of a superficial pustule (contains pus), a pimple, a deeper cyst, congested pores, whiteheads, or blackheads. Treatments vary depending on the severity of the acne. Acne develops when cells and natural oils begin to block up tiny hair follicles in the skin.","

Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,https://draxe.com/nutrition/chondroitin/," Helps Treat Osteoarthritis Joint Pain
Estimates show that over 27 million adults in the U.S. live with osteoarthritis, which is the most common type of arthritis and degenerative joint disease that’s characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and increased joint pain. Chondroitin sulfate is commonly used to treat pains associated with osteoarthritis, especially forms that affect very susceptible body parts like the knees and hands. Overall, studies have shown that use of chondroitin tends to cause modest improvements in joint pain over the course of several months, although some people experience even more benefits and more quickly — especially when combining several supplements together and making other changes like eating an arthritis diet to treat symptoms. According to the Arthritis Foundation, on average study participants usually experience about a 10 percent improvement in painful symptoms when using chondroitin compared to placebo. The best results are usually achieved after using a product containing it for three months or more. (5)
Recently, the University of Utah’s School of Medicine conducted the largest-ever clinical study investigating the effects of chondroitin and glucosamine, called “The Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT).” According to reports released by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, GAIT is the first large-scale, multicenter clinical trial in the U.S. to test the effects of the dietary supplements glucosamine hydrochloride (glucosamine) and sodium chondroitin sulfate (chondroitin sulfate) for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.",use of chondroitin tends to cause modest improvements in joint pain,neutral,"

Early anecdotal reports and small studies did suggest that the two compounds held great promise for relieving pain related to osteoarthritis. However, glucosamine and chondroitin—either together or alone—did not pass muster when they were studied in large controlled clinical trials. Their effect on pain and cartilage was no better than that of a placebo (inactive treatment) in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.",taking supplements of these compounds could help maintain cartilage,neutral,"

""The Healthy Geezer"" answers questions about health and aging in his weekly column.Question: Are glucosamine and chondroitin good for arthritis?Answer: Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis, which affects an estimated 27 Americans, is the most common form of the condition.Osteoarthritis develops when cartilage, the cushioning tissue in joints, wears down. By age 65, more than 50 percent of us have osteoarthritis in at least one joint. While the condition can affect any joint, it usually affects weight-bearing joints, such as the knees. Common symptoms include pain, swelling and tenderness.Treatments for osteoarthritis include exercise, weight loss, medication and surgery.",Glucosamine,neutral,"

Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/arthritis/effectiveness-glucosamine-and-chondroitin-sulfate-osteoarthritis," Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate dietary supplements may also help alleviate existing joint pain. Presently, it is thought that unlike many medications available to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements have very few side effects. However, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate nutritional supplements do not offer the desired pain relief for all osteoarthritis patients. At the time of this article, the benefits and risks of taking glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have not been definitively proven, and long term studies are needed to better understand their effects.

A New Study Finds Pharmaceutical Chondroitin Helps Knee OA Pain and Function


Chondroitin sulfate improves osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain and functional limitations in walking and daily activities as effectively as the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex), according to a new study published recently in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. But U.S. readers should know, there’s a catch: the researchers tested a version of chondroitin sulfate that is not available in this country. Chondroitin is a naturally occurring component of cartilage, which helps cushion joints. The product is manufactured from animal sources and sold as an over-the-counter, oral dietary supplement in the United States. The highly purified, high-potency pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate used in the study is available European and other countries, and sold under the brand names Chondrosulf, Condrosulf and Condral. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that in studies has been found to help relieve OA pain and is often used in OA drug trials for comparison.",Chondroitin sulfate,neutral,"

    Glucosamine and Chondroitine for Osteoarthritis by Dr. Andrea Furlan MD PhD, chronic pain specialist   
Many patients who suffer from osteoarthritis may benefit from the positive effects of taking this supplement. The painful symptoms of osteoarthritis may appear when cartilage becomes worn, and exposed bones begin to rub together. Conventional medicine does not yet have a proven treatment to stop or slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Traditional medical treatment includes drug therapy to control the pain associated with osteoarthritis.

Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,https://draxe.com/nutrition/chondroitin/," Helps Treat Osteoarthritis Joint Pain
Estimates show that over 27 million adults in the U.S. live with osteoarthritis, which is the most common type of arthritis and degenerative joint disease that’s characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and increased joint pain. Chondroitin sulfate is commonly used to treat pains associated with osteoarthritis, especially forms that affect very susceptible body parts like the knees and hands. Overall, studies have shown that use of chondroitin tends to cause modest improvements in joint pain over the course of several months, although some people experience even more benefits and more quickly — especially when combining several supplements together and making other changes like eating an arthritis diet to treat symptoms. According to the Arthritis Foundation, on average study participants usually experience about a 10 percent improvement in painful symptoms when using chondroitin compared to placebo. The best results are usually achieved after using a product containing it for three months or more. (5)
Recently, the University of Utah’s School of Medicine conducted the largest-ever clinical study investigating the effects of chondroitin and glucosamine, called “The Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT).” According to reports released by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, GAIT is the first large-scale, multicenter clinical trial in the U.S. to test the effects of the dietary supplements glucosamine hydrochloride (glucosamine) and sodium chondroitin sulfate (chondroitin sulfate) for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.",use of chondroitin tends to cause modest improvements in joint pain,neutral,"

Pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is as effective as celecoxib in alleviating pain and improving function in patients with knee OA. The findings are clinically relevant as they may provide clinicians with an alternative therapy to painkillers that can raise the risk of heart attack and stroke as well as gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. The study was funded by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company manufacturing chondroitin sulfate. follow @RheumAdvisor

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2019/08/26/14/02/omega-3-fatty-acids-for-the-management," The following are key points to remember from this American Heart Association (AHA) Science Advisory Statement on omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) for the management of hypertriglyceridemia:
Fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations may be categorized as normal (<150 mg/dl), borderline (150–199 mg/dl), high (200–499 mg/dl), and very high (≥500 mg/dl). Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dl) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥500 mg/dl) are far less frequently observed. Both are likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 AHA Scientific Statement, the n-3 FAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides and these agents are widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. This advisory summarizes the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (>3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents.",omega-3 fatty acids,neutral,"

Composed of the combined esters of three fatty acids and glycerol they are critical sources of energy for metabolic processes (containing more than double the caloric energy of carbohydrates).TGs are either directly ingested from dietary sources or synthesized in the liver from carbohydrate molecules. Large TG molecules are then packaged into very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles or are added to chylomicrons that are efficiently broken down to release free fatty acids necessary to metabolic processes. TG remnants of these activities are then cleared by the liver.Any breakdown of this process or overwhelming fat and carbohydrate intake that prodcues inadequate TG clearance results in hypertriglyceridemia.The short slide show above summarizes the mechanisms underlying elevated TGs and the role of omega-3 fatty acids in their treatment.Â References 1.Â  Arca M, Borghi C, Pontremoli R, et al.

Managing Hypertriglyceridemia With Omega-3 Fatty Acids: An AHA Advisory

The advisory from the American Heart Association aggregates the research performed thus far on the use of omega-3 fatty acids in hypertriglyceridemia and recommends a dose of 4 g/d to observe a therapeutic effect. According to a science advisory from the American Heart Association published in Circulation, 4 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids is a safe and effective treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, both alone and as adjunct therapy to other lipid-lowering agents. Researchers released this advisory as a summary of the lipid and lipoprotein effects of pharmacologic doses (>3 g/d) of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing severe levels of plasma triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL). In 2002, the American Heart Association recommended 2 to 4 g/d for total omega-3 intake (referring to eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) for triglyceride lowering. Since then, the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved prescription agents containing these components together or EPA alone.",safe and effective treatment,neutral,"

"
Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://caltonnutrition.com/which-omega-3-is-better-for-lowering-triglyceride-levels/," Our answer is a resounding YES! There is currently little evidence that plant-based oils, like flaxseed, chia seed, hemp seed or echium seed oils, help to lower high triglyceride levels. This is because plant-source omega-3s do not contain EPA or DHA, the ‘long-chain’ omega-3 fatty acids that are present in fish oil, which have been shown to produce the triglyceride-lowering effects and anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Instead, these plant-based seed oils contain a ‘short-chain’ omega-3 called ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which must be converted within the body to EPA, and then to DHA. However, this conversion is problematic because this conversion is very inefficient. In fact, the body only converts ALA to EPA and then to DHA at an efficiency rate of approximately 5 to 10 percent and 2 to 5 percent, respectively.",YES!,neutral,"

                        Krill oil pills spilled from a glass jar on a table                    


Researchers investigated the efficacy of a new drug containing a naturally derived krill oil mixture for treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), the use of ω-3 phospholipid/free fatty acid (PL/FFA)—a novel krill oil–derived ω-3 formulation—reduced triglyceride (TG) levels. Study results were published in JAMA Network Open. The investigators sought to establish the efficacy and safety of a naturally derived krill oil in patients with severe HTG by measuring TG levels and other lipid parameters. For the current study, researchers pooled the results of 2 identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials—Study of CaPre in Lowering Very High Triglycerides (TRILOGY 1 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03398005] and TRILOGY 2 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03361501]). TRILOGY 1 enrolled participants from 71 US centers between January 23, 2018, and November 20, 2019.",reduced triglyceride (TG) levels,neutral,"

The review found that probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants who developed an infection, the duration of the infection, and the antibiotic use for participants. While the data looks promising, the results aren’t completely in yet. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the current evidence shows that probiotics may work for reducing the number of upper respiratory tract infections people have and their duration, but more studies are needed to verify these initial results.

Let’s get to the evidence.There is evidence that has proven through a 3-stage, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study that probiotics clearly do help fight respiratory viruses. The 3-stage study was conducted in three different winters between 2003-2007. In all three stages healthy people were used.The following probiotics and compounds were used:Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium lactisLactoferrin (A protein found in colostrum)Prebiotics – (Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) )Stage 1 – 2003/2004 StudyIn this study, 237 people were used. They were broken down into two groups. One was given a formula containing three probiotic strains and FOS (An alternative sweetener) and the other was given a placebo.The results showed that respiratory infections in the group that was given probiotics decreased dramatically.As you can see from the rest of the study, stages two and three produced the same results.The study ultimately determined that regular and daily use of probiotics can reduce the risk and severity of respiratory infections.How Can Probiotics (Bacteria) Possibly Fight Respiratory Viruses?Numerous viruses cause respiratory infections.",probiotics can help prevent respiratory infections,yes,"

This review describes the most recent clinical findings, including safe probiotic therapies aiming to medicate respiratory infections, allergies, cancer, and neurological disorders due to their physiological interconnection. Subsequently, we will describe the major biological mechanism by which probiotic bacteriotherapy expresses its anti-viral, anti-allergic, anticancer, and neuro-stimulatory effects.Keywords: probiotic, anti-viral, anticancer, psychobiotics, mechanisms1. IntroductionHistorically the concept “probiotic” was initially proposed by the Nobel laureate and a biologist of Moldavian and Jewish origin, namely Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (Élie Metchnikoff) [1,2]. In 1908 Élie Metchnikoff disclosed that the consumption of fermented dairy products inoculated by starter cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus appeared to improve intestinal microbiota and was associated with promoting longevity in Bulgarian farmers [3].

As a result, identifying new and cost-effective strategies for managing a broad spectrum of respiratory tract infections is needed. In response, authors Julie L. Coleman et al. explored the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on respiratory tract infection incidence, duration, and severity among adults aged 18 to 65. The results of their scientific review, “Orally Ingested Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics as Countermeasures for Respiratory Tract Infections in Non-elderly Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,” were published in Advances in Nutrition, the international review journal of the American Society for Nutrition. To conduct their research, the authors searched for randomized-controlled trials that examined the effects of orally ingested probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics versus a placebo.","respiratory tract infection incidence, duration, and severity",neutral,"

Can aromatherapy massage help manage rheumatoid arthritis?,https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/natural-therapies/aromatherapy-for-arthritis-relief," By Mary Margaret Chappell and Jennifer Davis
Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City.",Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis,neutral,"

You might need ongoing treatments or tune-up visits when your symptoms of pain and stiffness return.RELATED: Try Aromatherapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Relief“Massage has been shown to be useful in reducing pain temporarily,” explained A. Lynn Millar, PhD, physical therapist and fellow emeritus of the American College of Sports Medicine. And best of all, she added, there's no reason not to include massage as part of your RA treatment. However, The Arthritis Foundation urges you to check with your rheumatologist first before starting any massage therapy to make sure it is appropriate for your individual health needs.Types of Massage Therapy Treatment Options for Rheumatoid ArthritisAlthough there are many types of massage, only two — moderate-pressure massage and myofascial release — have research support for pain relief for RA, but you can explore others as well.Results are encouraging. For instance, in another study led by Field, published in November 2015 in Complementary Therapies in Practice, the research team found participants who received a moderate-pressure massage targeted to the knees reported reduced pain and greater range of motion. Researchers speculate that the pain relief may be tied in part to an increase in the brain’s serotonin output, which the authors note is the body’s natural pain suppressant.RELATED: Does Medicare Cover Massage Therapy?",the question of how long those benefits might last remains unanswered,neutral,"

We discuss the most common methods of application and suitable essential oils below.Aromatherapy massageWhen a child falls over, they are often told to ‘rub it better’, and this is something that we sometimes do as adults. For some reason, this action seems to reduce the pain, and this is possibly because our nerve pathways are being stimulated to interrupt the pain signal to the brain, sometimes referred to as the pain gate mechanism. The same theory may be applied to aromatherapy massage in which the affected area is ‘rubbed’ using massage techniques, such as gentle effleurage and petrissage. However, it is important to note that pain indicates damage, so massaging inflamed sites should be done with care. Massage may provide short-term relief from pain because there is also an increase of endorphins released into the blood-stream as a result of the stimulation and these hormones are natural pain killers.",cannot cure osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis,neutral,"

The Research on Taking Minoxidil Orally for Hair Loss Is LackingSo far, there isn’t enough high-quality research to support oral minoxidil for hair loss. But a handful of small studies suggest that oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss, and may be more effective for some patients than topical treatments, Dr. Sattur says.For example, one small observational study involving 100 women experiencing female pattern hair loss suggested that a daily pill containing 0.25 milligrams (mg) minoxidil and 25 mg spironolactone was safe and effective in treating the condition. But the study did not use a control group, so it’s not clear whether these results are due to the medication.A later review, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in July 2020, looked at 17 studies involving 634 patients. The review suggested that oral minoxidil was a generally effective and well-tolerated alternative to topical minoxidil, though researchers add that larger, controlled studies are needed.5.

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Minoxidil is a Health Canada and US FDA-approved medication for hair loss in men and women. While 5% minoxidil foam has been approved for men since 2006, Health Canada and the FDA only approved 5% minoxidil foam for female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in 2014. Recent Phase III clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of once daily 5% minoxidil foam for treatment of FPHL, where a significant change from baseline in the target area hair count was observed compared to placebo. Similar changes in hair count for 5% foam and twice daily 2% minoxidil solution established noninferiority of the 5% foam formulation. Five percent minoxidil foam provides an additional option for women with FPHL and will soon be available in Canada. Similar articles

And in up to a quarter of the women who take it, minoxidil can actually encourage new hair to grow. It works best when you use it as soon as you notice that you’re losing hair, Yang says.It’s available over the counter, so you don’t need a prescription from a doctor to get it. However, Yang encourages everyone to see a primary care doctor or a dermatologist before beginning treatment, because there could be a medical problem that’s causing the hair loss, such as thyroid dysfunction or nutritional abnormalities.Minoxidil: ConsThere also are some disadvantages to taking minoxidil as a hair loss treatment.

The International Society of Hair Restoration (ISHRS) wrote that two studies found that the majority of patients who used 5% minoxidil for treating male pattern-baldness reported decreased hair loss, rapid onset of action in promoting new hair growth and very effective to effective new hair growth results during the treatment time.At the Limmer Hair Transplant Center in San Antonio, Texas, many of our patients have seen thicker hair growth after using Rogaine. In the picture above, a female patient was very frightened when she began using minoxidil and experienced hair shedding. But, as you can see, she stuck with her routine of using the medication daily and saw her hair mass index go up four points after just two months of treatment!So can Rogaine actually make your hair loss worse? Again, the short answer is no. It may seem as though you are losing more hair when you first start the treatment, but as long as you continue with your doctors’ plan, then you should begin to see fuller hair growth within a few months.Other Medical Hair Loss Treatment OptionsIn addition to Rogaine (Minoxidil), there are other medical/topical treatment options that can help slow down your hair loss and help to improve hair growth.Finasteride (which goes by the brand name Propecia or Proscar) is another very popular topical hair loss treatment option.Unlike minoxidil, which does not target the hormones in your body, Finasteride works by preventing testosterone from being converted into DHT in the prostate, hair follicles and glands.",no,no,"

Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,https://www.barberingtoday.com/1083408/the-potential-of-oral-minoxidil-to-treat-hair-loss," Oral minoxidil, however, is approved only to treat high blood pressure. That FDA approval came in 1979 but, as of 2022, oral minoxidil has not been approved by the FDA to treat AGA or any other cause of hair loss. Observers say such approval is unlikely to come any time soon, because the little pills are so inexpensive that companies have no incentive to fund the costly required research. When doctors prescribe oral minoxidil as a hair loss treatment, they prescribe it “off label,” as they do for many drugs. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 20% of prescriptions written today are for off-label use.

However, it is rarely a first-line agent. Other options might be considered first for many of these conditions, including consideration given to topical 2 or 5% minoxidil.

Harry Hoxsey was not a medical practitioner. But he was the young son of a rural Illinois veterinarian who used an herbal tonic and salve on animals, mostly horses, and then secretly on humans with cancer. The formulas were very successful.

Mechanism of Action










Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data.

Alternative medical treatment
Hoxsey Therapy or Hoxsey Method is an alternative medical treatment promoted as a cure for cancer. The treatment consists of a caustic herbal paste for external cancers or an herbal mixture for ""internal"" cancers, combined with laxatives, douches, vitamin supplements, and dietary changes. Reviews by major medical bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society,[1] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,[2] and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,[3] have found no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The sale or marketing of the Hoxsey Method was banned in the United States by the FDA on September 21, 1960 as a ""worthless and discredited"" remedy and a form of quackery. [4]
Currently, the Hoxsey Method is primarily marketed by the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico. Hoxsey Therapy is also marketed over the Internet; in June 2008, the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator noted that ""There is no scientific evidence that it has any value to treat cancer, yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that Hoxsey treatment is effective against the disease.",no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer,no,"

A wonderful book written by a remarkable man who had a fight to the finish with the ""High Priests of Medicine"" over his natural cancer cure which he had inherited for his father in the early 20th century. Hounded his entire adult life by the AMA, FDA and the government powers, Hoxsey claimed a 80% cure rate for any of his patients who had not previously done traditional treatments (ie, surgery and/ or radiation-chemo was not in wide spread use during most of his time treating patients). A claim that he seemed to back up since there have been thousands of testimonies from patients stating that Hoxsey's tonic did indeed save their lives by curing them from all sorts of cancers, many of which were considered late stage 4 terminal cases with absolutely no hope of survival.He was arrested more than 100 times during his lifetime and was hounded mercilessly until the government closed down his 17 domestic clinics (main one being in Dallas). He then instructed his head nurse Mildred Nelson to take the treatment down to Tijuana, B.C. Mexico in order to carry on his legacy. Here the clinic is still in business to this day.I also highly recommend the fabulous book When Healing becomes a Crime by Kenny Ausubel, which is meticulously researched and superbly written by a very skilled and creative author.",Hoxsey's tonic did indeed save their lives,neutral,"

Moreover, analyses of heart rate variability indicated that the reductions in HR and s-IgA were likely attributable to an attenuation of sympathetic nervous activation.

L-theanine fights back on this by reducing the central nervous system’s stress response and stimulating nitric oxide production—a compound that dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, which may reduce anxiety. L-theanine Side Effects
As the compound is found naturally in green tea, L-theanine is considered a safe supplement.

L-theanine reduces anxiety

Anxiety is a huge problem in today’s world. Many people live which are full of stress and worry, and it’s not as if a simple cup of green tea or theanine supplement could solve those problems. But what it can do is change the way your mind and body respond to daily stresses. If you can find ways to manage stress and anxiety in a productive way, then no matter what the challenge, you will be able to more effectively overcome it and prevent the negative symptoms associated with stress and anxiety. Aside from reducing alpha waves in the brain, in animal studies, it has been shown to produce an anxiolytic effect by altering serotonin and dopamine concentration in the brain. Furthermore, l-theanine blocks the binding of glutamic acid to the glutamate receptors in the brain and modulates GABA(A) receptors.",If you can find ways to manage stress and anxiety in a productive way,neutral,"

""A calming effect is usually noted within 30 to 40 minutes after L-theanine is taken at doses of 50 to 200 mg, and typically lasts 8 to 10 hours.

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  

Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:



The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)




Steam Inhalation and Sleep

There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  

Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.",doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria,neutral,"

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495," Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety. The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better. How does exercise help depression and anxiety? Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:

Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being

Does exercise improve the symptoms of depression?,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/a-30-minute-workout-may-help-relieve-some-symptoms-of-depression," Experts say the increased blood flow and oxygenation from exercise can affect neurotransmitters and chemicals that can impact depression. Exercising for just 30 minutes may significantly reduce symptoms of depression and increase the benefit received from therapy sessions at least temporarily, according to two recent studies from Iowa State University (ISU).Jacob Meyer, PhD, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and the lead author of both publications, told Healthline that while much is known about how exercise can help people in the general population, less was known about how it could potentially benefit people with depression.“We conducted these studies to gain a better understanding of the short-term effects of exercise and how we might be able to best capitalize on them for adults with depression,” Meyer told Healthline.Researchers investigated link between depression and exerciseIn the study, the research team recruited 30 adults experiencing major depressive episodes.Participants filled out electronic surveys before, half-way-through and after a 30-minute session of moderate-intensity cycling, and then 25, 50, and 75 minutes afterward.Those who cycled during the first lab visit came back a week later to repeat the experiment, but sitting for 30 minutes first, with the other group also reversing the order of exercise to rest.After these sessions, participants completed surveys with standard questions and scales used to measure depression symptoms.Improvement seen up to 75 minutes after exerciseThe survey data tracked changes in three characteristics of major depressive disorder, such as depressed mood state, difficulty experiencing pleasure from activities previously enjoyed (anhedonia), and decreased cognitive function.The findings indicate that during the cycling experiment, participants’ depressed mood state improved over the 30 minutes of exercise and up to 75 minutes afterward.They looked at how exercise impacted a person’s anhedonia, or the inability to feel pleasure,After about 75 minutes, the benefits of exercise in combatting anhedonia started to wear off. But it was still improved over the group that didn’t exercise.Those who cycled performed better on a test to detect depression in mid-exercise, but the findings were less pronounced 25 and 50 minutes afterward than in the resting group.Meyer said more research is needed to understand this variation.“We were unsure how long the short-term effects would last,” he said. “The finding that depressed mood state was improved up through the final 75-minute post-exercise time point – and likely lasts longer, was encouraging.”Meyer said this suggests the effect of a single exercise session lasts an hour or more, and they found similar benefits for anhedonia, although this may not last as long.At the end of the eight-week program, both groups showed improvement, but those who exercised before CBT showed a greater reduction in depressive symptoms.Participants who exercised also reported a quicker, stronger connection with their therapists, suggesting exercise might prime the brain to engage more with emotionally challenging work such as may occur during CBT.Although in more extreme cases, Dimitriu said stronger measures might be needed to treat this condition.“Therapy has been shown to be as effective as medication for depression – however it can take longer, unlike two pills of Prozac,” he cautioned.Dimitriu said medications might be more beneficial and faster acting than therapy for people with more severe symptoms or significant family histories of psychiatric conditions.Can amplify benefits of therapyThe findings suggest a window of time after exercise when someone with depression could better perform psychologically or cognitively demanding tasks, like a test or going to therapy.To find out whether this effect can work with the long-term benefits of therapy to deliver greater benefits, Meyer and the team conducted a separate pilot study.It involved ten participants, half of which exercised independently (cycling, jogging, walking) for a half-hour at moderate intensity before signing into an hour of virtual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) each week.The other five participants maintained their regular activities during the week before therapy.A little exercise every day could offer big benefits“The biggest takeaway is that while we know exercise is useful for many cardiovascular and physical health benefits,” said Meyer. “It also has potent psychological benefits from even just one session.”He also said exercising just once might change “the way the subsequent hours unfold” by reducing the severity of major symptoms of depression.“Figuring out how to map bouts of exercise, even short ones of lighter intensity, into people’s days could have an important influence on their well-being and day-to-day activities,” concluded Meyer.May “rewire” a depressed brain“Exercise is known to be of benefit to depression,” said Dr. Alex Dimitriu, double board certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine and BrainfoodMD. “In my practice, for anyone with either depression or anxiety, I recommend SEMM – optimizing Sleep, Exercise, Mediterranean Diet, and Meditation – daily.”He noted that exercise could benefit cognition and depression by boosting blood flow to the brain and increasing the growth of new neurons, which might help “rewire,” a brain stuck in a depression.Patricia Haynes, PhD, an associate professor at the University of Arizona’s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, said that increased blood flow and oxygenation due to exercise can affect neurotransmitters and “other chemicals that regulate alertness, anxiety, reward, and pain.”She added that exercise also improves self-esteem and body image, increases access to the outdoors, and creates social opportunities.“All of these things can also increase our mood,” Hanes said.She said it could be difficult to start a new exercise regimen when depressed.",exercise could benefit cognition and depression,neutral,"

These results are comparable with more recent data found in the REGASSA trial, the largest study with exercise and depression, which found a response rate of about 50% (31). The remission rate (people who no longer meet criteria for MDD diagnosis) was evaluated in the Treatment with Exercise Augmentation for Depression (TREAD) study (32) using and adapting (16 kilocalories per kilogram of weight spent in exercise per week) the pioneering idea of Andrea Dunn in determining the exercise dose based on the energetic expenditure did find a remission rate of about 28%.",Exercise can improve depressive symptoms,yes,"

They also had less pain and did better physically, although the psychological benefit was greater.With depression so prevalent, ""there is an urgent need"" to identify treatments, including non-medical options that people can do themselves, said Kristiann Heesch, who led the study.Heesch, senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology, and her colleagues point out in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine that depression is expected to be the second-leading cause of global disease by 2030 and the leading cause in high-income countries.One in 10 U.S. adults suffers from depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Women are 70 percent more likely to be depressed at some point in their lives than men, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.In previous research, Heesch found that exercise and walking could boost physical and emotional health in women who are not depressed.Advertisement

In fact, Heesch said in an email, physical activity may have an even greater effect on psychological health-related quality of life in women in their 50s and 60s who are depressed.Her team analyzed data on 1,904 women born in 1946-1951 who answered questions about their exercise habits, physical health and mental health in 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010.",exercise and walking could boost physical and emotional health in women who are not depressed,neutral,"

Many people use over-the-counter zinc products to prevent or treat their colds. But can this mineral really help cure the common cold? A recent analysis published in November 2021 in BMJ Open found the evidence mixed. Researchers pooled data from 28 randomized controlled trials that explored whether zinc lozenges, gels, capsules, or sprays could relieve cold symptoms or speed up treatment. One study showed that zinc shortened the duration of symptoms by an average of two days compared with a placebo.

Zinc supplements provided modest benefits in preventing and treating common symptoms of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in adults, according to a meta-analysis published in BMJ Open. Cheat sheets: Evidence-based medicine 101
Meta-analysis details 
For the analysis, researchers at Western Sydney University looked at 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 5,446 adults. The trials were published in 17 English and Chinese research databases as recently as August 2020. Notably, the researchers disclosed that none of the trials used in the meta-analysis studied zinc supplements for Covid-19 prevention and treatment. The studies included in the meta-analysis looked at multiple forms of zinc supplements, including lozenges, nasal sprays, and gels.","November 3, 2021",no,"

Wouldn’t a nasal spray releasing Zn2+ ions be the real cure? But, nature says, “No way!” Nasal sprays and nose drops releasing Zn2+ ions have been used for over a century as a mild, short acting, nasal decongestant having no role in shortening colds or curing colds. In his 1990 European patent Application (number 381522) Professor Derek Bryce-Smith of the University of Reading, Great Britain, found that frequent administration of strong zinc sulfate nose drops provided only a mild nasal decongestant effect — consistent with literature published in the 1930s. Conversely, Zn2+ ions released into the mouth can shorten or cure common colds because they are absorbed into tissues through the mouth-nose biologically closed electric circuit (BCEC), a recently discovered feature of human physiology.",curing,neutral,"

On average, the length of cold duration was cut down by 33 percent, which could mean at least a couple days sooner of relief. It’s important to note that the dosages in these studies, 80 to 92 mg a day, are much higher than the daily maximum recommended by the National Institutes of Health.

However, a more recent study (2009) involving 42 people with osteoarthritis, which used a small copper bracelet as a ‘placebo’ when testing magnetic therapy straps, reported no significant effects against pain or stiffness. The four devices (one of which was copper) were worn sequentially for a minimum of eight hours a day, for four weeks, over a 16-week period. Participants reported less sensory pain after wearing a standard magnetic wrist strap, than when wearing the other devices, and the conclusion was that copper bracelets were generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis.

However, magnets help the body produce more pain-relieving endorphins and reduce lactic acid and calcium deposits, which can cause pain in the joints and other parts of the body. Improves circulation

 It has long been thought, among hopeful perhaps superstitious arthritis sufferers, that wearing copper bracelets might have some healing power to reduce painful joint swelling. However, the medical and scientific basis for this belief is entirely lacking. Now, a new small study purports to further discredit this myth. To a minor extent, it does. A group of researchers based in Yorkshire, UK, led by Dr. Stewart Richmond of The University of York set out to assess the efficacy (or lack thereof) of copper bracelets to reduce pain and inflammation among 70 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The study design also included magnets (another phony cure that has been around forever): the group was divided into four parts, with a rotating treatment regimen consisting of 4 weeks of: copper bracelets, a full-strength magnetic device, a reduced-strength magnet, and a de-magnetized (placebo) device, with a one-week washout period in between.",wearing copper bracelets might have some healing power to reduce painful joint swelling,neutral,"

Some people use pure cocoa butter to help relieve dry skin.Like other natural moisturizers, such as coconut oil, cocoa butter is mostly made up of fatty acids. These fats may help form a protective layer on the skin, preventing moisture from escaping, and therefore stopping the skin from drying out.Some people also use cocoa butter to relieve skin dryness from common skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. While this works for some people, there is no scientific evidence that it will work for everyone.3.

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,neutral,"

Bottom Line
Antibiotic associated diarrhea can be a frustrating and potentially economically disadvantageous adverse effect from antibiotic administration in children, with a reported incidence of around 5% (Wistrom 2001). Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence, as theoretically their ingestion will reduce the disturbanceof normal gut flora, thereby decreasing the incidence of diarrhea (Roberfroid 2010.). We reviewed three trials and one systematic review on this topic, and found that the reviewed studies for the most part demonstrated a reduced incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with probiotics, compared to those treated with placebo (or plain yogurt). PGY-2: Fox et al found improvements in both stool frequency and consistency, as well as a reduction in other adverse events (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting).",Probiotics have been proposed as a means of reducing this incidence,neutral,"

																	Can Probiotics Prevent Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Children? Based on moderate quality evidence, probiotics were found to offer protection in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children. Findings from the study were published in The Cochrane Library. Antibiotics alter the gastrointestinal microbia, commonly causing AAD. Researchers set out to assess the safety and efficacy of probiotics (any strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children. The review included randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (ages 0-18) receiving antibiotics, that compared probiotics vs. placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment, and measured the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were.",Diarrhea,neutral,"

A clinical evidence synopsis published in mid-October by JAMA determined that a recent Cochrane review provides moderate-quality evidence for the safe and efficacious use of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children.As the most widely prescribed medications for pediatric patients, antibiotics can be lifesaving, but AAD occurs when these drugs disturb microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics, found in dietary supplements or foods like yogurt, contain blends of nonpathogenic, beneficial bacteria that may competitively inhibit “bad” bacteria and restore balance in the microbial environment.“AAD is unfortunately relatively common, especially in children, albeit somewhat rare in infants,” reported Kim Benner, PharmD, BCPS, FASHP, FPPAG, professor of pharmacy practice and director of postgraduate programs in pharmacy practice at the Samford University McWhorter School of Pharmacy and pediatric clinical pharmacy specialist for Children’s of Alabama.“The article states 11% to 20% [incidence], but some estimates state more like 25% to 30%.

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,neutral,"

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.rand.org/news/press/2012/05/08.html," Researchers from the RAND-based Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to find studies that examined whether probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Researchers pooled results from the studies together to gain a clearer understanding of whether probiotics can prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Use of probiotics was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of developing diarrhea when taking antibiotics as compared to not using probiotics. The RAND analysis estimates that 13 people would need to use probiotics in order to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, researchers say the evidence was insufficient to show which type of microorganism was better than another because the included strains were poorly documented and often given as blends of several types. Further, there was no indication that the response varied systematically by a person's age, the duration of antibiotic use or other clinical indications.",probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea,neutral,"

          Background:
        
      
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity. Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib,naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. Search strategy:
        
      
      We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Current Contents (up to March 2002).",Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen,neutral,"

Osteoarthritis is usually diagnosed based on physical examination and X-rays. There are no specific blood test abnormalities associated with osteoarthritis. How Osteoarthritis Is Treated
Medical treatment for OA is fairly straightforward, primarily consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen to control pain and inflammation. Steroid injections in an affected joint can sometimes provide relief. “There aren’t as many disease-modifying agents for OA as there are for inflammatory arthritis,” says Dr. Shadick. “There aren’t as many medications that can stop osteoarthritis dead in its tracks.” The race to discover or develop medications dubbed “DMOADs” — disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs — that would halt or reverse joint degeneration is currently a very active area of research.",Medical treatment for OA is fairly straightforward,neutral,"

Music therapy seems to be beneficial also for anxiety (low‐quality evidence), which is often a comorbidity of depression. Severely depressed individuals often experience impairment in maintaining relationships and work engagements. In this regard, evidence suggests significant amelioration in the level of functioning among those who attended music therapy sessions (low‐quality evidence). Improvements in depressive symptoms and functioning are likely interrelated: Mitigation of depressive symptoms may lead to better outcomes in the socio‐occupational sphere, and vice versa.

Music therapy is a powerful intervention for helping individuals manage stress and reduce the symptoms of depression. You might think that listening to sad music when depressed would make someone feel worse, but studies have shown that people with depression prefer sad music, reporting that they find it soothing and uplifting.

Researchers say that treatment of the disorder with currently available medications provides only modest results. But studies have shown that populations that eat larger amounts of seafood tend to have lower rates of mental disorders linked to personality disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depression. This prompted researchers to investigate whether increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish would have any effect on symptoms. The study, published in the January 2003 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, compared the effects of daily fish oil supplementation (one gram of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or E-EPA) in 20 adult women with moderate borderline personality with 10 women who were given a placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, women who took the supplements had significantly diminished aggression as well as a drop in the severity of depression compared with the placebo group.",increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids,neutral,"

Can omega-3 treat borderline personality disorder in women?,https://visionsteen.com/new-study-omega-3-fatty-acids-and-borderline-personality-disorders-in-adolescents/," We’ve learned that applying Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), for example, has shown positive results in the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorders–recent studies have confirmed this, showing lower suicide rates, less self-harming incidents, and less self-removal from treatment. Psychiatry is still a relatively young science, and growth and change are happening quickly as practitioners eagerly seek resolution to some of the most challenging psychological issues. Dr. Ammiger’s discovery regarding the use of Omega-3 fatty acids is profound. The study, though small in scope, produced impressive results: the data “suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, at the right doses for a long-enough period of time, can significantly improve the quality of life for people with borderline personality disorder.”
 
More research around the use of Omega-3 fatty acids will need to be done to ultimately determine the long term efficacy of Omega-3 fatty acids, but Ammiger’s study has shone a light into what is a dark corner for many. _______________________________

Most fish oil supplements contain a combination of EPA and DHA, which are the two major omega-3 fatty acids primarily responsible for fish oil’s health benefits. The most recent study used a concentrated fish oil containing both these fatty acids. In the 2003 Harvard study, however, the researchers used a concentrated form of EPA-only. There is no reason to believe that an EPA-only formulation is necessary, as long as a full 1200 mg of EPA plus DHA or a full 1000 mg of an EPA-only fish oil product is consumed daily.",may be a safe and effective therapy,neutral,"

Emerging research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can be used therapeutically in borderline personality disorder. In treatment studies, researchers rely on just two omega-3 components: EPA and DHA. Silvio Bellino and colleagues from the University of Turin in Italy showed that EPA (1200 mg per day) plus DHA (800 mg per day), when added to therapeutic doses of Depakote, reduced impulsivity, anger, and self-harm in a group of patients with borderline personality disorder. In a separate study from Harvard University, Mary Zanarini and Frances Frankenburg showed that an 8-week course of treatment with EPA (1000 mg per day) outperformed placebo treatment in reducing depression and aggression in women with borderline personality.

The study looked at the effect of taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity. Three important results were reported from this new research:

People with asthma who took Vitamin D supplements as part of their asthma treatment plan were 50% less likely to go to the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital for asthma flares than those who did not take Vitamin D supplements. Taking Vitamin D was linked with needing less glucocorticosteroids following an asthma attack (either injection or tablet form). Patients whose Vitamin D levels were “low” at the beginning of the study experienced the greatest benefit from taking Vitamin D supplements. For these patients, their use of glucocorticosteroids with asthma flares decreased by more than half (55%).",taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity,neutral,"

The number of asthma patients with uncontrolled symptoms is significant. “[The disease in] over 50 percent of all asthma patients [is] not well-controlled, which results in symptoms like coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. In fact, in a recent survey we found that over 80 percent of patients limited simple activities like household chores and exercise at least once per week due to asthma,” Winders said.

WHAT: Supplementing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with vitamin D does not reduce the rate of treatment failure in patients with asthma and vitamin D insufficiency, finds a new National Institutes of Health-funded study. The Vitamin D Add-on Therapy Enhances Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Asthma (VIDA) trial randomized 408 adults with low vitamin D and mild/moderate asthma to receive the ICS ciclesonide supplemented with either high-dose vitamin D3 or placebo; the participants were then monitored over 28 weeks for the occurrence of worsening asthma. Vitamin D3 supplementation did not reduce the proportion of participants who experienced at least one treatment failure (28 percent vs. 29 percent in placebo) or one exacerbation (13 percent vs. 19 percent) nor the overall exacerbation rate. More of the vitamin D treated patients were able to reduce their inhaled steroid dose by 75 percent compared to those treated with placebo (89 percent vs. 80 percent). Further studies on the potential for Vitamin D to lower the required effective dose of inhaled steroids are needed to determine if the suggested benefit seen in this study will be seen in other patients. Overall, Vitamin D supplementation was not associated with any increased risk of adverse events, and most participants (82 percent) who were given supplements achieved an adequate level of Vitamin D.

High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults. The study participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting the broad range of global geographic settings, involving Canada, India, Japan, Poland, the UK, and the US. The majority of people recruited to the studies had mild to moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma.",it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections,neutral,"

Individuals who take an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to their standard asthma medication had a reduction in severe asthma attacks, according to a new review published in the Cochrane Library.There has been a link between low blood levels of vitamin D and the increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. This link has spurred a growing interest in the potential role vitamin D plays in asthma management, because it may help reduce upper respiratory infections that can lead to exacerbations of asthma, and several clinical trials have tested this theory.For the review, a team of Cochrane researchers examined 7 trials that involved 435 children, and 2 studies that involved 658 adults, who were ethnically diverse. A majority of patients recruited into these studies had mild-to-moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma.AdvertisementThe studies last between 6 and 12 months, and most of the patients continued to take their usual asthma medication while participating. After analyzing study data, the researchers found that giving patients an oral vitamin D supplement reduced the risk of severe asthma attacks that required hospital or emergency department admission from 6% to about 3%.Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma attacks that needed treatment with steroid tablets. These results were largely based on trials in adults.An additional finding showed that vitamin D did not improve lung function or day-to-day asthma symptoms, nor did it increase the risk of side effects at the doses that were tested.“We found that taking a vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma treatment significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma attack, without causing side effects,” said lead review author Adrian Martineau.",vitamin D did not improve lung function or day-to-day asthma symptoms,no,"

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.foxnews.com/health/can-vitamin-d-improve-lung-function-in-asthma," Remember, it is important to always discuss the use of supplements and vitamins (such as vitamin D) with your asthma doctor or allergist. It is not designed to replace your asthma treatment but may have a role in complementing your existing treatment of this condition.What is the right decision for a patient with asthma when it comes to vitamin D? Well it all depends; previous studies have not yet looked at what the benefit of taking vitamin D would have in those with asthma. Longer term research will be necessary to determine the appropriate role of this vitamin going forward although it appears that having a deficiency of vitamin D can possibly lead to worsening asthma.The level of vitamin can help in determining whether indeed you are getting an adequate amount from your diet and/or exposure to sunlight. The levels can vary depending on seasonal factors such as winter-spring vs. summer-fall, when levels are usually higher. So ask your doctor about a vitamin D blood test to see what your level of this valuable vitamin is so you can best determine with their assistance whether a supplement is necessary for you or a family member.",may have a role in complementing your existing treatment of this condition,neutral,"

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319617," Not only does the vitamin aid calcium absorption, which is vital for healthy bones, but it also helps to strengthen the immune system. It is the latter function that has led researchers to investigate vitamin D as a possible treatment for asthma.Respiratory infections, such as the common cold or the flu, are known to trigger symptoms of asthma – including airway inflammation, which can bring on an asthma attack.Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may help to lower the risk of respiratory infection-induced asthma attacks by boosting the immune system.To gain a better understanding of this association, Prof. Martineau and colleagues conducted a review of seven randomized controlled trials that looked at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on asthma severity.Asthma events, hospital visits reducedThe review included a total of 955 subjects with asthma, all of whom were receiving standard treatment for the condition.It was found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for asthma-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions by 50 percent when compared with a placebo, with the rate of such events falling from 6 percent to 3 percent.Also, among adults who did experience an asthma attack, vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections by 30 percent, from 0.43 events per person per year to 0.30 events per person per year.From a subgroup analysis, the researchers found that patients whose vitamin D levels were low at study baseline experienced the greatest benefit from vitamin D supplementation; their need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections fell by 55 percent.Still, they note that the small number of participants in each subgroup makes it difficult to confirm whether or not initial vitamin D levels influence the effect of supplementation on asthma severity.Further clinical trials underwayImportantly, it was also found that vitamin D supplementation was safe for participants at the doses used, and there were no differences in adverse effects between subjects who took vitamin D and those who took a placebo.Overall, the researchers believe that their findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation may be an effective way to help reduce asthma severity.“These results add to the ever growing body of evidence that vitamin D can support immune function as well as bone health.”Prof. Adrian Martineau“Vitamin D is safe to take and relatively inexpensive,” adds Prof. Martineau, “so supplementation represents a potentially cost-effective strategy to reduce this problem.”First study author Dr. David Joliffe, also of QMUL, notes that because the majority of study subjects were adults with mild to moderate asthma, they are currently unable to generalize the findings to children or individuals with more severe asthma.“Further clinical trials are ongoing internationally,” adds Dr. Joliffe, “and we hope to include data from them in a future analysis to determine whether the promise of today’s results is confirmed in an even larger and more diverse group of patients.”AsthmaRespiratoryEmergency MedicineImmune System / VaccinesShare this articleBy Honor Whiteman on October 4, 2017Latest news'Sticky' cholesterol and hypertension may increase heart attack, stroke riskType 2 diabetes: How intermittent fasting could help reverse the conditionType 2 diabetes: Low carb, high fat diet may help manage weight loss, glucoseCardiovascular disease: New oral anticoagulants may have lower bleeding riskType 2 diabetes: Coffee may reduce risk following gestational diabetes diagnosisRelated CoverageIs it safe for people with asthma to wear face masks?People with asthma can have breathing difficulties.

Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.”

Furthermore, taking a vitamin D supplement does not cause any noticeable side effects, making it a great choice for treatment if it does indeed work as well as suggested. The down side: researchers noted that the vitamin D supplements did not improve day-to-day lung function of asthma sufferers. [1]  Vitamin D supplements also did not seem to have any effect on the time people took off of work or school due to their asthma. As no one died during the study, it is also not possible to tell if the supplement reduced mortality risk.Dr. Erika Kennington, from the charity Asthma UK, stated:“While this research shows promise, more evidence is needed to conclusively show whether Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks and symptoms.",vitamin D supplements may actually help reduce the risk of severe asthma attacks,yes,"

Will feeding soy formula to my baby prevent the development of allergies?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/soy-formula," This belief may stem from studies linking soy-rich diets to a lower risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease in adults (6, 7, 8, 9).However, there’s currently insufficient evidence demonstrating that soy formula use in infancy reduces a baby’s risk of developing these diseases later in life (1, 2, 3).Similarly, there’s no strong evidence that soy formula reduces digestive issues like colic or offers any additional protection against allergies. Therefore, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (3, 10). On the other hand, experts agree that soy formula is the most appropriate choice for full-term babies with galactosemia or hereditary lactase deficiency — two medical conditions that prevent babies from breaking down the natural sugars in cow’s milk (1, 2). Soy formula is also the most appropriate choice for vegan families. Although the vitamin D3 in most soy formulas is currently sourced from sheep lanolin, they’re the closest available option to fully vegan baby formula.summaryMany believe that soy formula use in infancy reduces colic, allergies, and the risk of disease later in life, but more research is needed to confirm this.

Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants 

When babies are not exclusively breastfed, evidence suggests that using a soy formula instead of a cow's milk formula does not reduce allergies in infants and children. Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula. Authors' conclusions:

However, our observational study found subtle effects in estrogen-responsive tissues in soy-fed infants, and we don’t know if these differences are associated with long-term health effects.”
Some mothers who don’t breastfeed have long used soy formula as an alternative to cow-milk formula, often from concerns about milk allergies, lactose intolerance, or other feeding difficulties. However, soy protein contains high amounts of genistein, an estrogen-like compound. Like other estrogen-mimicking chemicals found in the environment, genistein can alter the body’s endocrine system and potentially interfere with normal hormonal development. In laboratory studies genistein causes abnormal reproductive development and function in rodents, but little is known about its effects on infants.",if these differences are associated with long-term health effects,neutral,"

Within the last half-dozen years, however, a number of studies began casting doubt on this strategy. The most famous was a groundbreaking trial called the LEAP (Learning Early About Peanut Allergy) study. Published in 2015, it showed that, compared to babies who avoided peanut, those who began eating it early (between four and 11 months) and who ate it consistently were up to 80 percent less likely to have developed an allergy to it by age five.

The main thing it does is support decreases in calorie intake by blocking the absorption of dietary fat.The average person trying to lose weight should be following a low-fat diet. If they have got their diet right, there will be not much fat to block.

It is famous as a “fat blocker” or “fat trapper” over the counter.According to the claims, the pill may minimize the amount of fat absorbed in your gastrointestinal tract.Moreover, the Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning regarding such claims. It claims that there is no scientific evidence that can prove this claim. According to a review of high-quality trials, overweight adults who took chitosan did not shed large amounts of weight. It has also been studied to see if it can help lower cholesterol levels. It also lowers total cholesterol and LDL “bad” cholesterol in recent well-designed studies.",did not shed large amounts of weight,neutral,"

Getting physical activity is an important part of managing osteoarthritis. But if you aren’t currently active, it’s important to start an exercise routine as soon as you start to have pain. A variety of land and water exercises can improve your hip muscles and OA pain, including strengthening, aerobic and flexibility activities. A physical therapist can develop a specific program of hip strengthening and flexibility exercises to help get your pain under control. Overall, it’s important to get moving and maintain the activities you enjoy in daily life for as long as possible.

4 Strengthening Exercises for Hip Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common ailments affecting nearly 3 million people in the United States each year. It’s a chronic condition involving the bones and cartilage within a joint. OA is the breakdown of the cartilage within a joint that results in exposed bone. When this condition occurs, it causes bone on bone friction, resulting in pain, stiffness, loss of motion, decreased stability and/or the formation of bone spurs. Related: Arthritis – Not Just an Issue For The Elderly
The hip is a ball and socket joint that consists of the thigh bone (femur) and it’s articulation on the pelvis known as the acetabulum. The hip joint provides a high range of motion allowing the femur to move freely through a 360° circle.","

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.ptvitals.com/blogs/news/hip-osteoarthritis-exercises," Here are 5 of the best exercises and stretches that will help you improve mobility and relieve pain. Low-to-Moderate Intensity Aerobic Exercise
Low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise is one of the best forms of exercise for anyone, but especially for those with hip arthritis. It helps improve your cardiovascular health and boosts the circulation of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints. What type of aerobic exercise is best depends entirely on your personal preferences and how you experience hip osteoarthritis. Here are some of the best: 

Walking and hiking 
Swimming 
Cycling (use an electric bike to reduce and control the difficulty if you live in a hilly area) 
Horseback riding 
Aerobic dance exercise, such as Zumba 
Yoga and pilates, just make sure it’s not too hard on the hips

This article will discuss the importance of exercise for managing osteoarthritis as well as the types of exercises that should be avoided. UpperCut Images / Getty Images


   Benefits of Exercise for Osteoarthritis   

Osteoarthritis causes increased pressure and resulting pain and inflammation within affected joints. Exercise plays a key role in preventing joint damage and decreasing irritation. Exercise strengthens surrounding muscles that help to support and stabilize joints and decrease pressure, especially within large weight-bearing joints like the hips and knees. Exercise can also improve blood flow and synovial fluid quality within joints, helping to improve range of motion and relieve joint stiffness.",some exercises are better than others,neutral,"

"
Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hip-arthritis-exercises," Begin with light and easy exercises and gradually increase the intensity, frequency, or duration of the activity as tolerated.Prepare the joint: Always do warmups before and cooldowns after every exercise. Always begin with stretching or other ROM exercises to prepare the body for strength and aerobic exercises.Respect pain: When the hip or other body parts feel painful, stopping for a while or adjusting the exercise to a more tolerable level can help.Physical therapists recommend people modify activities as necessary. Arthritis symptoms may come and go. A person should try to stay active and perform activities based on what feels tolerable at the moment.Home remediesAside from exercise, a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis.Alternative remedies are things people can introduce to their daily routine at home. These include:Hydration: Drinking enough water may help the body produce synovial fluid, keep joints lubricated, flush out toxins, and reduce inflammation.Assistive devices: Using aids such as reachers may help people avoid positions that cause pain. Walking supports can help improve mobility while distributing the weight outside of the body, reducing stress on the joint.Diet: Following a balanced diet can help a person maintain a moderate weight and reduce pressure on the hip joint.Heat and cold therapy: Applying hot and cold compresses may improve joint stiffness and swelling.",a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis,neutral,"

Looking for a ""light duty"" alternative to heavy manual labor is one good approach for coping with osteoarthritis of the hip. Many patients who work at desks find that prolonged sitting in one position is associated with stiffness and pain upon first arising so periodically standing stretching or moving the hip through an arc of motion can be helpful at minimizing this “start-up” pain.

It would appear that a 12-week program with exercises generally including strengthening and range of motion three times per week is beneficial, Bennell told Reuters Health by email. ad goes here:advert-1ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE“Based on the overall body of work in physical activity, though, any regular physical activity is likely to be beneficial to most patients,” Nelson says. “It is safe to say that most adults do not get enough physical activity, and that this is even more of an issue among those with osteoarthritis.”

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercise-rx-for-overcoming-osteoarthritis," Exercise should be individually tailored, to prevent injury and aggravation of the osteoarthritis. That usually means starting with an evaluation by a physician, physical therapist, or other health professional experienced in the management of osteoarthritis. The activities your clinician recommends — and his or her advice on how much and how often to exercise — will depend on various factors, including which joints are involved, how severe the pain is, how fit you are, and whether you have other medical conditions. Flexibility (range-of-motion) exercises
The first step is flexibility exercise to improve joint mobility, reduce stiffness, and help prevent tightening of the tissues around the joint. Flexibility exercises gently stretch and lengthen the muscles and move the joints through a range of motion that's comfortable — you should not feel pain — but produces a sensation of resistance. You should perform these exercises (see examples) when you are feeling the least pain and stiffness — for example, after a warm shower or at the end of the day.",will depend on various factors,neutral,"

11 Hip-Strengthening Moves for Osteoarthritis



HealthCentral reports on the best strength training and mobility exercises for hip osteoarthritis (OA) according to HSS physical therapist Meghan Lamothe PT, DPT, OCS, ATC.Some pain when you move is normal with OA, but that shouldn’t stop you from exercising, explained Lamothe. Lamothe counseled to follow her three-point rule: Before physical activity, rate the pain from zero to 10. If the pain goes up by more than three points—say, from a three to a seven—you’ve done too much. Stop and rest. If the pain comes back down, you can continue.","If the pain comes back down, you can continue",neutral,"

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.healthcentral.com/slideshow/osteoarthritis-hip-strengthening-exercises," Research suggests you could do just that, says Maura Iversen, D.P.T., a physical therapist and dean of Sacred Heart University’s College of Health Professions in Fairfield, CT. “Studies show that exercise alone is as effective as taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) on a regular basis,” Iversen says. “I tell patients, ‘If you do your exercises regularly, you can skip the Naprosyn.’” For best results, you’ll want a plan that includes cardiovascular activity, balance exercises, and strength training. iStockHow Exercise Helps Hip OAStrength training helps build muscles that support the hip, shifting some of the stress from the joint onto the surrounding muscles, Iversen says. Your muscles also help stabilize the joint and keep it aligned, which prevents OA from getting worse. “In a nicely aligned door, it moves perfectly well.",prevents OA from getting worse,neutral,"

   Benefits of Exercise for Osteoarthritis   

Osteoarthritis causes increased pressure and resulting pain and inflammation within affected joints. Exercise plays a key role in preventing joint damage and decreasing irritation. Exercise strengthens surrounding muscles that help to support and stabilize joints and decrease pressure, especially within large weight-bearing joints like the hips and knees. Exercise can also improve blood flow and synovial fluid quality within joints, helping to improve range of motion and relieve joint stiffness.",some exercises are better than others,neutral,"

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.texasjointpain.com/best-osteoarthritis-exercises-hip-and-knee/," These exercises help you move each joint through its full range of motion. Movement can help keep your joints flexible, reduce pain, and improve balance and strength. To get started, try to do these exercises for your hip and knee osteoarthritis daily:
For Knee Osteoarthritis
Sitting knee extension: Sit in a chair and extend one leg as much as you can. Hold the position for 2-5 seconds and bring it back down. Repeat on both sides 10 times.Sitting knee flexion: Sit on the edge of a chair. Lift one knee and extend.",reduce pain,neutral,"

This review showed that there is high-quality evidence that in people with hip OA, exercise reduced pain slightly and improved physical function slightly. Further research is unlikely to change the estimate of these results. Low-quality evidence indicated that exercise may not improve quality of life. Further research is likely to change the estimate of these results.",exercise reduced pain slightly and improved physical function slightly,neutral,"

 Benefits of Exercise for Managing Hip Arthritis
""Personalized exercise can be beneficial for hip arthritis by increasing muscle strength for joint stability, increasing flexibility for a better range of motion, and decreasing weight and body fat, which decreases inflammation and pressure on the joint,"" Dr. Fruge says. Advertisement
     Case in point: A small January 2017 study in the ​Journal of Osteoporosis​ found that women 65 and older who performed hip exercises for arthritis three times a week had 30-percent less hip pain and 20-percent improved range of motion and strength after 12 weeks. In addition to strengthening your muscles and improving flexibility, exercise helps with hip arthritis by moving the nutrient-rich synovial fluid in your joint, Wickham says. ""The synovial fluid contains all of the nutrients that your joint needs to maintain healthy cartilage and tissues. The main way that this joint synovial fluid is moved and distributed to different areas of the cartilage located within your joint is by movement."" Exercise can also help ease hip pain by sending signals to your brain and nervous system that your joint isn't in danger, which is one of your body's main mechanisms for producing a pain signal, Wickham says.",30-percent less hip pain,neutral,"

Women seeking treatment for infertility sometimes take dietary supplements and antioxidants -- vitamin C, vitamin E, melatonin, or combination supplements, among others -- in the hopes of boosting fertility. But the new Cochrane review, published Sunday, found little evidence supporting efficacy of the supplements. ""I don't think the results were surprising in the sense that there are no national organizations or guidelines that recommend routine use of antioxidant supplements for fertility,"" said Dr. Wendy Vitek, head of the fertility preservation program at the University of Rochester's Strong Fertility Center, who did not work on the new review. ""But I definitely have women ask me about supplements,"" Vitek said. ""I think there are a lot of feelings of self-blame with infertility, and women are looking to gain some sense of being proactive and of potentially controlling a very uncontrollable situation.

Lead researcher Marian Showell of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The University of Auckland in New Zealand said women undergoing fertility treatment often take dietary supplements including antioxidants, to try to increase their chances of becoming pregnant. The researchers analyzed data from 28 studies involving a total of 3,548 women treated at fertility clinics. The results show no significant increase in women becoming pregnant when taking antioxidants compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid, a supplement recommended for pregnant women to help prevent certain birth defects. Women taking antioxidants experienced no more adverse effects compared to those who received placebos or standard treatment, the study said. Overall, the researchers considered the quality of the studies to be low or very low and the number of different antioxidants tested made it difficult to make comparisons, Showell said. Advertisement

Oxidative stress can disrupt the normal redox state of cells, damaging them and their DNA through the production of peroxides and free radicals.",no link between antioxidant supplements and a better chance at conceiving,no,"

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200228105232.htm," The study also found that antioxidant supplements likely do not improve pregnancy and live birth rates. The study appears in Fertility and Sterility. advertisement








Antioxidant supplements are commercially available to help treat male infertility, but research on its effects on semen quality and rates of pregnancy and live birth are limited. The new study reports on results from the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility Trial (MOXI), a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted at nine sites across the United States. The study enrolled 171 couples where the male partner had at least one abnormal reading on an analysis evaluating sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality; the female partners had normal fertility test results. Men received a placebo or an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins C, E and D, selenium, l-carnitine, zinc, folic acid and lycopene for at least three months and up to six months.",Antioxidant supplements are commercially available to help treat male infertility,yes,"

Many women will also take antioxidants supplements to help improve their chances of conception. However, there is limited evidence that nutritional supplements improve fertility, and little attention has been paid to the potential harmful effects of taking unregulated antioxidants. But do antioxidant supplements really improve a woman's chances of getting pregnant? In their new study, Dr. Marian Showell and colleagues reviewed data from 28 clinical trials on 3548 women seeking to improve their fertility by taking one or more antioxidants.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.vital-reaction.com/blogs/news/antioxidant-supplementation-infertility," All three of the common causes of infertility mentioned earlier can all be treated with a healthy dose of antioxidants. A study done earlier this year showed that of a group of 379 infertile men, 274 of them after taking antioxidant supplements (B12, zinc, selenium, arginine, vitamin C, and vitamin E) showed a boost in sperm count and quality. Essentially, any antioxidant that neutralizes free radical activity can be beneficial for infertile men. But if you’re looking for the crème de la crème, molecular hydrogen tablets are the way to go.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23913583/," It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may be a result of female problems, including ovulatory disorders, poor egg quality, fallopian tube damage and endometriosis. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. Objectives:
        
      
      To determine whether supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. Search methods:
        
      
      We searched the following databases (from inception to April 2013) with no language restrictions applied: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and OpenSIGLE.",limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility,neutral,"

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.newhope.com/nutrition/antioxidants-dont-boost-fertility," Around a quarter of couples planning a baby are thought to have difficulty conceiving. Women undergoing fertility treatment often take dietary supplements, including antioxidants, to try to increase their chances of becoming pregnant. However, many antioxidant supplements taken to improve fertility are unregulated and there is limited evidence on their safety and effects. The researchers analyzed data from 28 trials involving a total of 3,548 women attending fertility clinics. Antioxidants did not increase the women’s chances of conceiving or having a baby. The results show no significant increase in women becoming pregnant when taking antioxidants compared to those taking placebos or being given standard treatment, including folic acid.",there is limited evidence on their safety and effects,neutral,"
