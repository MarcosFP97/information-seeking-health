To reduce body temperature (fever)
To aid in elimination thru the skin
To relieve restlessness
To provide comfort and relaxation
To maintain hygiene and promote comfort

Tepid sponge bath:
Sponging of the skin with alcohol or tap water
  (18 -32C or 65-93F)
Baths given for reducing body temperature →
  before performing, obtain the baseline
  temperature of the patient
Special considerations:
  o Assess the patient’s condition → check VS
 esp. Temperature
 § Increase it temp = increased PR, RR, BP
  o Provide privacy
  o Bathwater below body temperature, usually
 in the range of 65-93F
  o Sponge each limb for 2- 3 minutes and the
 back and buttocks
  o The sponge bath should take about 25-
 minutes
  o Reassess VS at the end
  o STOP if the client becomes chilled or begins
 SHIVERING
Condition must be observed during the
  procedure → Vital signs
Observe patient for elevated temperature
Review physician’s orders
Check vital signs BEFORE and AFTER bath
Elde rly skin tends to get dry, so you may want to
  apply lotion to the arms and legs before putting
  clothes back on
Comb the person’s hair and apply cosmetics and
  other body products according to the patient’s
  preferences

PROCEDURE

CHANGING AN UNOCCUPIED BED
Preparation: determine what linens the client
  may already have in the room
Performance
  o If the client is in bed, prior to performing the
 procedure, introduce self and verify the
 client’s identity using agency protocol. Explain to the client what you are going to do,
 why it is necessary, and how to participate. o Perform hand hygiene and observe other
 appropriate infection control procedures
  o Provide privacy
  o Place the fresh linen on the client’s chair or
 overbed table– do not use another client’s
 bed
  o Assess and assist the client out of bed using
 assistive devices as appropriate

§ Make sure that this is an appropriate and
    convenient time for the client to be out of
    bed
§ Assist the client to a comfortable chair
o Raise the bed to a comfortable working
height
o Apply clean gloves if linens and equipment
have been soiled with secretions or
excretions
o Stripping the bed:
§ Check bed linens for any items belonging
to the client, and detach the call bell or
any drainage tubes from the bed linen
§ Loosen all bedding systematically,
starting at the head of the bed on the far
side and moving around the bed up to the
head of the bed on the near side
§ Remove the pillowcases, if soiled, and
place the pillows on the bedside chair
near the foot of the bed

Can Folic Acid Improve Cognitive Function? Folic acid has be used to treat people suffering from memory loss, Alzheimer’s, and Dementia for some time now. There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:

Improved memory
Better change in cognitive function

Edward Reynolds draws together the evidenceFolic acid is important for functioning of the nervous system at all ages.1–4 In the fetus the relation between maternal folate status and the risk of neural tube defects is well established: clinical trials have shown that periconceptual preventive treatment with 400 μg or higher of folic acid significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, inborn errors of folate transport and metabolism are associated with a variety of overlapping syndromes which are influenced by age of clinical presentation. These include developmental delay, cognitive deterioration, motor and gait abnormalities, behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, seizures, signs of demyelination or failure of myelination, and vascular changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging or postmortem examination.4 Less commonly, subacute combined degeneration and peripheral neuropathy may also occur.In adult patients presenting with megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, approximately two thirds have neuropsychiatric disorders which overlap considerably with those associated with anaemia due to vitamin B-12 deficiency. 2 5 However, depression is commoner in patients with folate deficiency, and subacute combined degeneration with peripheral neuropathy is more frequent in those with vitamin B-12 deficiency.",PJIt is becoming clear that folic acid affects mood and cognitive function,neutral,"

                Dutch researchers have concluded that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in older adults. It is known that the cognitive functioning, especially information processing speed and memory decline with age. The researchers showed that there was a way to slow down the process. They randomly assigned 818 older adults in Holland, aged 50 to 70 years old, and gave them 800 micrograms of folic acid supplementation every day or a placebo for three years. All the study participants had low folate levels, as evidenced by elevated homocysteine concentrations.

No evidence that folic acid with or without vitamin B12 improves cognitive function of unselected elderly people with or without dementia. Long-term supplementation may benefit cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels 

In the economically developed world, folate deficiency is one of the commonest vitamin deficiencies. Several reports suggest a higher prevalence of various psychiatric disorders in elderly people with folate deficiency.

AbstractFolic acid supplementation has drawn much attention in recent years for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline. In this review, the authors describe how current evidence does not support the use of folic acid supplements to protect against cognitive decline. Although a few studies suggest that folic acid supplementation may provide neuroprotection among persons who are folate deficient, there is also data to indicate that supplementation in persons without folate deficiency may pose a risk to neurological function. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in old age and may not be easy to recognise. Folic acid supplementation may mask the anaemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and, therefore, may delay treatment while allowing progression of neurological symptoms.",Folic acid,neutral,"

Earlier this year, Dutch researchers reported that older adults who took high doses of folic acid supplements (800 micrograms a day) were less likely to suffer from failing memory as they aged. In the current study, however, doses above the daily RDA of 400 micrograms did not seem to provide additional benefit.

Doctors found those with low levels of folate - a B vitamin - in their blood faced triple the risk of developing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.

Can folic acid help improve cognition and treat dementia?,https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/72/5/567," Methyl folate (50 mg) was as effective as a standard antidepressant drug trazodone (100 mg daily) in elderly depressed patients with mild to moderate dementia.36
In summary, the main improvements are in mood, arousal, and cognitive and social function and may continue up to 1 year or more after the start of therapy.14 There is evidence that the nervous system response is related both to the dose and the duration of treatment as well as the folate status of the patient. However, given the restricted entry of folate into the nervous system, small doses over prolonged periods may be preferable to large doses in the short term, especially in view of the risks. Clearly, however, there is a need for more clinical trials to clarify issues of formulation, dose, and duration. Neural tube defects
There is a well documented relation between folate status and intake and the risk of neural tube defects, although most pregnant women with low folate do not have babies with neural tube defects. Intervention studies have shown that periconceptional preventive treatment with folic acid of 400 μg or higher significantly reduces the risks of such defects.4,9 Since 1995 young women planning pregnancies have been advised to take 400 μg of folic acid and this educational policy has significantly reduced the incidence of neural tube defects in the United Kingdom to 181 cases in 1998, although some of this reduction is due to terminations. It has been estimated that fortification of flour in the United Kingdom by 240 μg of folic acid per 100 g of flour would prevent a further 74 cases (41%).9 Although it is assumed that folic acid overcomes genetically determined defects in folate metabolism that interfere with normal neural tube development, the exact mechanisms are not clear.","the main improvements are in mood, arousal, and cognitive and social function",neutral,"

The Link Between Folic Acid and Dementia
Research shows that regular folic acid intake could reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease by as much as 60 percent and, along with Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E, it appears to be one of the most effective vitamins for Alzheimer’s and dementia. It’s not just about Alzheimer’s prevention, either, with folic acid potentially holding the key to slowing down neurodegenerative decline in people with the condition. Exactly how folic acid reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease isn’t clear, although experts believe there are two ways in which the vitamin could be beneficial. Some professionals claim that folic acid regulates levels of homocysteine in the body, which is an amino acid which has long been thought to contribute towards dementia. Other Alzheimer’s clinical trials are also suggesting that the anti inflammatory properties of folic acid could help to reduce or prevent inflammation in the brain, minimizing the risk.",isn’t clear,neutral,"

Objective: To investigate whether supplementing older men with vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid improves cognitive function. Methods: The investigators recruited 299 community-representative hypertensive men 75 years and older to a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of folic acid, vitamin B6, and B12 supplementation vs placebo over 2 years. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). A secondary aim of the study was to determine if supplementation with vitamins decreased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia over 8 years. Results: The groups were well-balanced for demographic and biochemical parameters. There was no difference in the ADAS-cog change from baseline to 24 months between the placebo (0.8, SD 4.0) and vitamins group (0.7, SD 3.4).",improves cognitive function,neutral,"

Many studies have shown that the supplementation of folic acids will prevent you from cervical dyslapsia, which is a pre-cancerous condition of the cervix.

Does duct tape work for wart removal?,https://www.healthline.com/health/duct-tape-for-warts," There is older and newer research that seems to demonstrate that duct tape works better for wart treatment than other methods, such as freezing.One 2003 study claims that duct tape is 80 percent effective for speeding up the rate at which warts go away.More clinical research is needed to discover if, and why, duct tape works to get rid of warts.

We also discuss other ways to remove warts.Does it work?Share on PinterestPeople must use repeated applications of duct tape to remove a wart with this method.Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work for several reasons. One theory is that the tape deprives the skin cells of oxygen. By “suffocating” the wart, the duct tape makes it more likely that the skin cells will die.The process of applying and removing the duct tape may also remove additional skin cells, which can make the wart less bulky and noticeable.However, there is a lack of recent research into using duct tape as a wart removal treatment, and earlier studies have produced mixed results.One 2002 study found that the duct tape method was significantly more effective than cryotherapy, which involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The study included 51 participants ages 3–22.They received either up to six sessions of cryotherapy, which took place every 2–3 weeks, or 2 months of duct tape application. Warts resolved entirely in 85% of the participants in the duct tape group and in 60% of those in the cryotherapy group.However, a 2007 study into using adhesive pads to treat warts found that adding duct tape to a breathable fabric called moleskin made no difference to its effectiveness.",Proponents of using duct tape for wart removal think that it may work,neutral,"

      There are different types of blisters depending upon the causes. Burn blisters erupt when the skin gets burnt due to any reason be it an accidental hot water pour or heat burn. If you immediately dip the affected area in cold water or pour some icy cold water to it or place ice cubes on it, the blisters may not form. In severe cases of burns, getting burn blisters is common but you still need to aid them. If ignored and left to heal on their own, burn blisters may cause lifelong scarring. Having said that, you are not supposed to pop or damage a blister as this can trigger infection.","

      The aim of this 2-year study was to test the hypothesis that folic acid, vitamin B12 and sun exposure could be helpful in treating vitiligo. One hundred patients with vitiligo were treated with oral folic acid and vitamin B12 after being informed that sun exposure might enhance repigmentation. They were requested to keep a record of sun exposure in summer and UVB irradiation in winter. The minimal treatment time suggested was 3-6 months but should be longer if improvement was achieved. Clear repigmentation occurred in 52 patients, including 37 who exposed their skin to summer sun and 6 who used UVB lamps in winter.",folic acid,neutral,"

This is why it is always recommended to take these two vitamins together in order to treat vitiligo. According to some scientific studies, a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation and sun exposure is a good strategy to regain natural skin color. Supplementation of B12 and folic acid along with pantothenic acid, a water soluble form of B vitamins, has also shown very promising outcome in removing white patches. Vitamin A, C, and E

However, if you have vitiligo there is not enough melanin in your skin, so it is not protected. Always apply a sunscreen, ideally with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or above, to protect your skin from sunburn and long-term damage. This is particularly important if you have fair skin.

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/," More recently, an extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, (which compared 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg vitamin B-12 daily with placebo) in 1,298 participants found that after a median of 54 months, the intervention had no effect on CVD risk [77]. Overall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other B-vitamins does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death. Dementia and cognitive function
Observational studies have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [78-81]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions [80]. Most observational studies have found correlations between low serum vitamin B12 concentrations alone or in combination with high folate concentrations and poor cognitive function [82-87]. For example, an analysis of cross-sectional 2011–2014 NHANES data on 2,420 adults aged 60 years or older found that low vitamin B12 (MMA greater than 0.27 micromol/L or serum vitamin B12 less than 203 pg/mL [150 pmol/L]) combined with high folic acid—unmetabolized serum folic acid greater than 0.44 mcg/L (1 nmol/L) or serum total folate higher than 32.7 mcg/L (74.1 nmol/L)—was associated an almost two to three times higher risk of cognitive impairment [82].",does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death,no,"

The results of the study showed that further depigmentation stopped in 64% of the patients; clear repigmentation was observed in 52% and total repigmentation was seen in 6% of the patients. During the study, patients were asked to combine these nutritional supplements with sun exposure during the summer months and UVB lamps during the winter. The results clearly showed that the combination of folic acid, vitamin B12, and UV exposure was more effective than each of the 3 treatment options for vitiligo. How Folic Acid Works for Vitiligo
The high homocysteine levels observed in vitiligo patients are caused by low levels of folic acid and vitamin B12. However, the oxidation of homocysteine produces some reactive oxygen species that build up in the skin and increases the oxidative stress placed on melanocytes.",more effective,neutral,"

Vitamins and Supplements
Studies have shown that people with vitiligo are often deficient in certain vitamins, like folic acid, B12, copper and zinc. These, along with others like CoQ10, vitamin E, sometimes vitamin C and a high-quality multi-vitamin are prescribed by some doctors to help stabilize the immune system. Vitamins/supplements are generally used in combination with other treatments. Some studies have shown that folic acid, B-12, and sun exposure can help repigment the skin when used together.

Can vitamin b12 and sun exposure together help treat vitiligo?,https://effectiveremedies.com/home-remedies-for-vitiligo/," The lack of B12 in your body can increase the oxidative stress on your skin resulting in the destruction of melanin cells, which lead to the loss of pigmentation. Thus, increasing the intake of vitamin B12, and folic acid through the oral supplement can stimulate the repigmentation of the white spots, the main signs of vitiligo. In addition, a study published in Acta Dermato- Venereologica in 1997 shown that vitamin B12 and folic acid combined with the sun exposure can contribute to the repigmentation of vitiligo patches rather than any vitamins and sun exposure alone. How to do: 

Take 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12 every day along with 5 mg of folic acid twice a day

During an asthma attack, the airways become narrowed and inflamed. The muscles surrounding them tighten and squeeze, resulting in symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.Treatment for asthma usually involves taking medication, which relaxes the muscles around the airways and reduces swelling and mucus.Some research shows that yoga may be useful as a complementary treatment for asthma. This means that a person would perform it in addition to an existing treatment plan, likely involving medication.A 2016 review of clinical trials involving 1,048 participants found that yoga somewhat improves quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.

Yoga may have health benefits for people with asthma 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library suggests that yoga may have a beneficial effect on symptoms and quality of life in people with asthma, but effects on lung function and medication use are uncertain. Asthma is a common chronic disease affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The many typical symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath.Yoga has gained global popularity as a form of exercise with general life-style benefits, and recent studies have investigated the potential of yoga to relieve asthma-related problems.A new Cochrane Review summarizes the results of randomized trials and has found evidence that practicing yoga might be able to improve asthma quality of life and symptoms to some extent. However, researchers also warned that higher-quality studies with more participants would be needed to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of yoga.The team of Cochrane researchers wanted to find out the effects of yoga in people with asthma.They found 15 randomized controlled trials which involved 1,048 men and women. Most of the trials were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United States. The majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years.",effects on lung function and medication use are uncertain,neutral,"

These exercises relieve stress and improve the function of all of your body systems including your immune system, so you will be able to fight off respiratory infections more readily.Yoga also increases body awareness. You will become more tuned into your body’s subtle signs. By recognizing slight changes quickly, you will be able to recognize signs of flare-ups of symptoms quickly and then take action.Better Breathing and Breathing TechniquesUnlike most other forms of exercise, yoga teaches breathing techniques, which can strengthen your lungs and the muscles that support respiration.Breathing techniques can also help relieve stress, which is important because stress causes increased resistance within your airways. If you are having difficulty breathing due to your asthma, you naturally experience stress, and as stress increases your breathing becomes more difficult. Yoga breathing exercises can be used to prevent and break this often terrifying cycle.Calm Your MindMeditation is an integral component of yoga practice.",Yoga also increases body awareness,neutral,"

BackgroundAlthough the efficacy of yoga in treating bronchial asthma[1] has been investigated since at least the 1960s [2–9], most of the previous studies have been uncontrolled, and have evaluated only a few selected yogic postures or breathing exercises. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one randomized controlled trial which has evaluated the efficacy of an integrated package consisting of yogic postures, breathing exercises, cleansing techniques, meditation, devotional sessions and lectures[10]. However, even this study did not investigate the mechanisms by which yoga improves the symptoms of bronchial asthma.

Is starving a fever effective?,https://www.thedailymeal.com/healthy-eating/it-feed-cold-starve-fever-or-starve-cold-feed-fever," When someone was struck with a cold, eating was thought to increase the body's internal heat enough to ward off the shivers, while denying the body food, or ""starving a fever,"" would have the opposite effect. But according to modern science, it's rarely ever a good idea to try to starve an ailment away. Starving a cold or a fever can hinder a person's recovery because it deprives the immune system of the necessary energy required to fight the infection. A fever is the body's natural response to a foreign pathogen, and the increase in internal temperature is designed to kill the offending bacteria or virus. As the body fights the infection, more calories are needed to maintain the higher internal heat. The same principle holds true for a cold.",it's rarely ever a good idea to try to starve an ailment away,no,"

The mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant, but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component (i.e., selenium-containing proteins), and not to selenium itself (4). Can antioxidant supplements help prevent cancer? In laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Therefore, researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans. Many observational studies, including case–control studies and cohort studies, have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans.",the antioxidant effects,neutral,"

Hormonal contraception affects primarily the appearance and development of cysts formed as a result of hormonal disorders. So hormonal birth control for ovarian cyst treatment can be used only in case of functional cysts. As you know, ovarian follicular cyst occurs when the ovarian follicle, which is formed during each menstrual cycle, is not destroyed and the egg can’t be released from it. In the case of the so-called corpus luteum cyst, there is another situation. After the rupture of the follicle and the exit of the egg from it, a yellow body is formed. If during the menstrual cycle the woman has not got pregnant, the corpus luteum usually disappears.",can be used only in case of functional cysts,neutral,"

Treatment of Ovarian Cysts - Do Birth Control Pills Cure Ovarian Cysts? By
			Rachelle Ray  |  
Submitted On June 08, 2010

































The treatment of ovarian cysts is usually approached by doctors in the same way. Either she will recommend surgery or you will automatically be put on some kind of hormonal treatment like birth control pills.Birth Control Pills will regulate your monthly cycle and keep your ovaries from releasing an egg. This can be a fix for awhile. However once you stop taking the birth control pills, the cysts will return.So no, this is not a cure for these cysts.",this is not a cure for these cysts,neutral,"

"
Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,https://www.cochrane.org/CD006134/FERTILREG_oral-contraceptives-to-treat-cysts-of-the-ovary," The other five included women who developed cysts without fertility treatment. In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own. Authors' conclusions: 

Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate.",birth control pills should not be used for this purpose,neutral,"

Though 
                        birth control pills do help in preventing cysts yet it 
                        is not the ultimate solution. There have been cases 
                        where in spite of taking birth control pills cysts have 
                        occurred. And birth control pills can't actually cure 
                        the cysts. In fact the conventional treatments only try 
                        to cure the symptoms rather than trying to reach and 
                        eliminate the root cause of these ovarian cysts. The 
                        holistic approach tries to eliminate the root causes of 
                        the ovarian cysts and thus eliminating every symptom in 
                        the process. The holistic approach is gaining more and 
                        more popularity also because of the absence of any side 
                        effects or disadvantages.",birth control pills can't actually cure,no,"

Will taking birth control pills treat an ovarian cyst?,https://www.mamapedia.com/article/birth-control-to-shrink-an-ovarian-cyst," Depending on the type of cyst, most likely it will shrink on its own, though not likely because of the birth control pill. Studies show that birth control may prevent cyst formation becuase it keeps hormones regulated, but the research we've seen doesnt suggest it will shrink (though we haven't tried since our daughter is only 7). If you havne't already scoured the internet for information, here is a good medical site that will give you some good information. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ovarian-cysts/DS00129  And although we haven't had a surgery yet for our daughter (and hopefully wont since she apears to have a follicular cyst that is very slowly shrinking), the information we have suggests that surgery often can be done to preserve future fertility. Good luck. Report This

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19472602/," Studies found no adverse effects of maternal zinc supplementation on iron status during pregnancy. More information is required on other potential adverse effects, particularly with regard to a possible modifying effect of preexisting maternal zinc status. In view of the possible benefits of zinc supplementation for reducing the risk of premature delivery, the possible positive impact of zinc supplementation on infant birthweight among undernourished women, and the lack of reported adverse effects, zinc should be included in maternal supplements given during pregnancy in populations at risk for zinc deficiency.

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://www.pregworld.org/zinc-while-pregnant/," A plasma concentration below 98 mcg/dL constitutes a zinc deficiency, which has been associated with a slow healing of wounds, birth defects, loss of appetite, retardation and malformations of the immune system.Zinc Deficiency during PregnancyZinc deficiency occurs when its concentration in the organism falls below normal limits. Women who are pregnant and experience zinc deficiency risk giving birth to babies with intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight, as zinc is very important for the fetal development the entire pregnancy.Zinc deficiency during early pregnancy may lead to severe complications, which include miscarriage. Because of this, it`s very important when you find out you`re pregnant to do all the required analyzes and start taking prenatal vitamins that your doctor will recommend. Most prenatal vitamins include optimal doses of zinc, so pregnant women can no longer worry about the risks of zinc in the human organism.Foods that Are Rich in ZincFeeding remains the main source from which you can get your zinc during pregnancy. If you eat well and pay attention to add as many foods rich in zinc as you can in your menu, you may get the full daily dose that is recommended in your diet without needing supplements.Here are some of the foods that contain a high content of zinc:Zinc food sourceZinc miligrams3/4 cup zinc fortified cereals1590 g roast beef8.990 g pork roast4.21 chicken breast2.71 cup of yoghurt2.21/2 cup bean beans1.830 g of oleaginous fruit mix1.130 g of cheese1.11 cup of milk9100 g wheat germ16.7100 g spinach0.8100 g of dark chocolate6,8100 g mushrooms0,9 Note: There are women who agree to take prenatal vitamins during pregnancy that include zinc and women who are against them because they gain weight or experience other side effects.Interactions with other MedicinesPharmacists whose patients are given zinc supplements should know some interactions that minerals might have with other medicines.The administration of zinc should be done separately from the iron administration at least 2 hours apart. The interaction between these 2 types of supplements is less pronounced if they are administered before or after one of the meals.Other 3 supplements interact directly with zinc.",There are women who agree to take prenatal vitamins,neutral,"

Will taking zinc supplements improve pregnancy?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc-supplements," Insulin is the hormone responsible for transporting sugar from your bloodstream to your tissues (11).Some research suggests that zinc may help keep blood sugar levels steady and improve your body’s sensitivity to insulin.One review reported that low zinc levels could be linked to impaired blood sugar levels and type 2 diabetes (12).Other research shows that zinc may help reduce insulin resistance, which can improve your body’s ability to use insulin efficiently to maintain normal blood sugar levels (13, 14).Helps fight acneZinc supplements are often used to promote skin health and treat common skin conditions like acne (15).A type of zinc called zinc sulfate has been proven especially useful for decreasing symptoms of mild to moderate acne (16).According to one review, not only did people with acne tend to have lower blood levels of zinc compared with those without acne, but zinc supplements were also able to decrease the average amount of inflammatory bumps caused by the condition (17).Zinc supplements are also often favored over other treatment methods, as they’re inexpensive, effective, and associated with far fewer side effects (15).May improve heart healthHeart disease is a serious health condition, accounting for roughly 33% of deaths worldwide (18).Some research shows that taking zinc may improve several risk factors for heart disease. They may even lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels.A review of 24 studies found that zinc supplements decreased levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood triglycerides. As such, they could potentially help prevent heart disease (19).Another analysis of nine studies showed that zinc supplements could reduce systolic blood pressure levels, which is the top number of blood pressure readings (20).However, research on the effects of supplements on blood pressure is limited. Further, some studies suggest that low levels of serum zinc may be associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, though findings remain inconclusive. Thus, more research is needed (21).Slows macular degenerationMacular degeneration is a common eye disease and one of the leading causes of vision loss around the globe (22).Zinc supplements are often used to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and help protect against vision loss and blindness.One 2014 study in 72 people with AMD showed that taking 50 mg of zinc sulfate daily for 3 months slowed the progression of the disease (23).Other reviews similarly recommend zinc supplements to slow the progression of AMD, claiming that it may improve nutrient flow in the retina to protect against disease (24, 25).However, other studies suggest that zinc supplements alone may not significantly improve vision and should be paired with other treatment options to maximize results (26).As such, more research is needed to learn more about the connection between this mineral and eye health.SummaryZinc may reduce the duration of cold symptoms, support blood sugar management, improve severe and inflammatory acne, decrease heart disease risk, and slow the progression of macular degeneration.5 Foods that Are High in ZincTypes of zinc supplementsWhen choosing a zinc supplement, you’ll likely notice that there are many different types available.These various forms of zinc affect your health in distinct ways.Here are a few types you might find on the market:Zinc gluconate.

Do ankle braces help heal an ankle fracture?,https://healthprep.com/articles/conditions/guide-recovering-fractured-ankle/," Fractured ankles are typically not possible to diagnose without radiographic imaging such as an x-ray, MRI or CT scan. Only a highly trained professional should determine whether to splint or cast the injury after proper physical evaluation and imaging. Stable ankle fractures, typically those involving one bone and select impact, can be completely healed with the use of a cast or splint. While a medical professional may make the process seem simple, the technique, the cast or splint used greatly impacts healing. Improper alignment of the fracture results in inadequate healing and is likely to inhibit a return to full function.Learn more about recovering from a fractured ankle effectively now.Surgical InterventionIBD ReliefNot all fractured ankles will properly heal with the above treatments alone.

But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. ""People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not,"" Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it ""a proven scientific fact"" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also ""nonsense"", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. ""People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars,"" Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen.",vitamin E will not help scars,no,"

    The importance of exercise when you have diabetes



February 3, 2021



For people who have diabetes—or almost any other disease, for that matter—the benefits of exercise can't be overstated. Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:

Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes.",Exercise helps control weight,neutral,"

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun.

Insulin can be thought of as a key, unlocking the cells and facilitating glucoses entry from the blood. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities, with weight carried in the abdominal area increasing the risk even more. Along with a healthy diet, exercise can help facilitate weight loss, manage blood sugars, and protect against long-term complications of diabetes, including heart disease and nerve damage.

Fermented milk for hypertension 

High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure.

In recent years, fermented dairy foods have been gaining attention for their health benefits, and a new review published in the Journal of Dairy Science, published by Elsevier, indicates these foods could help reduce conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure). A team of investigators from the Center for Food Research and Development in Sonora, Mexico, and the National Technological Institute of Mexico in Veracruz reports on numerous studies of fermented milks as antihypertensive treatments and in relation to gut microbiota modulation. They also examine the potential mechanistic pathways of gut modulation through antihypertensive fermented milks.In addition to the impact of genetics and the environment, there is growing evidence that gut microbiota may also have an effect on the development of hypertension. In this sense, gut dysbiosis (a marked decrease in richness and diversity of the gut microbiota) has been linked to different metabolic diseases, including hypertension.“Several studies have indicated that fermented milks may positively affect gut microbiota or provide antihypertensive effects,” explained investigator Belinda Vallejo-Córdoba, PhD, of the Center for Food Research and Development.",hypertension,neutral,"

Can fermented milk help mitigate high blood pressure?,https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2006/01/24/New-evidence-of-fermented-milk-s-effect-on-blood-pressure," Together with the UK and Ireland, 
Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
""does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects""​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood 
pressure in animals, and to lower blood pressure in people with 
mild hypertension.",does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects,neutral,"

The results showed a 7-8 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure and a 5-7 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure, depending on in-office monitoring versus automated monitoring systems.No changes were seen in body mass index (BMI), blood lipids or blood sugar levels.Fermented milk productsThe invited review: Fermented milk as antihypertensive functional food, published in the June edition of the Journal of Dairy Science by L.M. Beltrán-Barrientos et al, looked at the available information related to the evaluation of fermented milk containing antihypertensive peptides by in vitro and in vivo studies.The authors note that these studies are required before a fermented functional dairy product may be introduced to the market.It states that although commercial fermented milks with antihypertensive effects exist, they are scarce and most are based on Lactobacillus helveticus​.Opportunity for product developmentThe paper notes that several fermented milk products are on the market, including Ameal (Calpis Co., Tokyo, Japan), Calpis (Calpis Co.), and Evolus (Valio, Helsinki, Finland), among others.The review says that a great opportunity is available for the development of functional dairy products with new lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that support heart health through blood pressure- and heart rate-lowering effects.The authors note that while these products attribute their antihypertensive effect to the bioactive peptides present in the fermented milk, they also contain minerals such as potassium and calcium, which have been demonstrated to have a positive effect on blood pressure.They say that more research on the subject is needed, but that the development of functional foods that support a healthy heart through lowering blood pressure offers new market opportunities.Source: Journal of Dairy Sciencedoi:10.3168/jds.2015-10054“Invited review: Fermented milk as antihypertensive functional food”Authors: L.M.

Biologically active tripeptides, Lactobacillus helveticus, fermented milk, ambulatory blood pressure measurement, hypertensionThe milk protein-derived biologically active peptides isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro) and valyl-prolyl-proline (Val-Pro-Pro) prevent the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)1–3 and lower blood pressure (BP) in mildly hypertensive subjects.4,5 It has been suggested that the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of these tripeptides may at least, in part, be the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).2The Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro tripeptides have been shown to lower ACE activity in the aorta in SHR after a single oral administration and after a long-term intake6,7 and increase plasma renin activity (PRA) in SHR.2In previous studies, a daily intake of 2.25 mg of Ile-Pro-Pro and 2.55 to 3.75 mg of Val-Pro-Pro has reduced systolic BP by 7 to 10 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 4 to 7 mm Hg more than the control product in humans.4,5 These tripeptide doses reduced BP without adverse events, but the effects of higher doses on BP have not been evaluated. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) has not been used in any of the previous studies, although it is regarded as being the most reliable method of BP measurement, without white coat hypertension effect.8The aim of the present study was to evaluate the BP-lowering effect and possible adverse events of Lactobacillus helveticus LBK-16H fermented milk with a high tripeptide concentration on hypertensive subjects by using 24-h ABPM.

If it’s not brought under control, hypertension can lead to heart disease, stroke and kidney failure.

      Dupilumab (Dupixent, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi Genzyme) is a novel biologic medication recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who have not achieved adequate control with topical medications. Dyshidrotic eczema is a distinct entity, often considered on the spectrum of atopic dermatitis, that primarily effects the palms and soles; it is often associated with considerable morbidity yet is frequently challenging to treat. We report two cases of recalcitrant dyshidrotic eczema treated successfully with dupilumab at standard dosing. Further studies to establish the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of dyshidrosis are warranted. <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):355-356.</em></p>.",successfully with dupilumab,neutral,"

Improvements in positive affect, perceived stress, and pain were also noted. Our same yoga program was used in a follow up study which also found improvements in balance, functional reach, upper body function, and pain after completing the intervention.35  Participants from this clinical trial communicate back to us that they continue to practice yoga, now almost a decade later.

Doing [yoga] every day would be wonderful, but even a couple of times a week is helpful.”

However, none of these prior studies looked specifically at online yoga programs for people with this condition, until now.The new study involved 212 people with knee osteoarthritis. All participants had access to online information about osteoarthritis, treatment options, and the benefits of physical activity, weight loss, and healthy sleep habits.Researchers randomly assigned around half of the people to do a 12-week self-paced online yoga program.The program consisted of a series of 12 pre-recorded 30-minute videos. People were asked to do one video a week, three times during the week.The classes included a slow-paced mix of static and dynamic yoga poses designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles of the core and legs. Instructors also offered different modifications and levels of the poses, so people could adapt the program to suit their personal needs and abilities.However, the classes focused on physical postures but didn’t include other aspects of yoga, such as deep relaxation, chanting, and meditation, which could also help reduce pain.Physical function improved with yogaAfter 12 weeks, subjects who did the yoga classes saw greater improvements on average in their physical function, knee stiffness, and quality of life, compared to those who only had access to online osteoarthritis education.Still, there was only a small difference between the two groups in the level of knee pain while walking at 12 weeks.After the program ended, researchers followed up with participants another 12 weeks later. By then, both groups had similar levels of physical function, pain, knee stiffness, and quality of life.This loss of benefits seen in the yoga group may be because many people stopped doing the yoga classes after the 12-week program ended.During the last week of the course, over two-thirds of participants completed at least two classes a week.",improve pain,neutral,"

Bartlett, Ph.D., an adjunct associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins and associate professor at McGill University “Yoga may be especially well suited to people with arthritis because it combines physical activity with potent stress management and relaxation techniques, and focuses on respecting limitations that can change from day to day.”Arthritis, the leading cause of disability, affects 1 in 5 adults, most of whom are under 65 years of age. Without proper management, arthritis affects not only mobility, but also overall health and well-being, participation in valued activities, and quality of life.

Yet up to 90% of people with arthritis are less active than public health guidelines suggest, perhaps due to arthritis symptoms such as pain and stiffness, but also because they are unsure of how best to remain active.The study recruited 75 people with either knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults 

Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people, the main feature is a painful, and often disabling, headache. Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting. Migraine affects about 1 person in 8, mainly women, and mainly in the age range of 30 to 50 years.Sumatriptan is one of the triptan family of drugs used to treat migraine attacks. It can be given by four different routes: by mouth (oral), by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), by nasal spray (intranasal), and by suppositories (rectal). Separate Cochrane reviews for each of these routes provided information on how well sumatriptan worked at reducing headache pain in over 50,000 people with migraine.",It can be given by four different routes,neutral,"

It was not a lot better than using sumatriptan alone, but it was much better than using naproxen alone. Attacks were more successfully treated when medication was taken early, when pain was mild.

Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. For many people, the main feature is a painful headache.",it was much better than using naproxen alone,neutral,"

Can the drug Imitrex (sumatriptan) treat acute migraine attacks?,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199108013250504," The efficacy of sumatriptan compared very favorably with that of other drugs used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.6 7 8,23 Furthermore, unlike other antimigraine drugs, such as ergotamine, that are considered to be effective only if given early in an attack,7,8 sumatriptan was also effective when given late. In addition, sumatriptan was well tolerated. Adverse events were mostly minor and transient, and the incidence and severity were not dose-related. A few patients had minor electrocardiographic changes, but the incidence of these was the same in the groups given sumatriptan and that given only placebo. Furthermore, such electrocardiographic changes have been observed during migraine attacks.24 25 26 We therefore think that they are unlikely to have a causal relation to sumatriptan treatment. In this single-dose study, most patients rated treatment with sumatriptan as good or excellent, even though headache recurred in a significant proportion of them.",The efficacy,neutral,"

Most patients’ migraine attacks subside within two hours of taking Imitrex. Most people with migraine can benefit from a prescription acute medication like Imitrex. If you have fewer than four migraine attacks per month, or your attacks are mild and not disabling, an acute medication may be the only prescription medication you need to manage your migraine disease.

While you're not supposed to stare directly into a light therapy lamp, you still don't want to expose yourself to daily UV radiation while trying to treat your seasonal depression.

Light therapy is usually used to treat depressive conditions caused by a lack of light. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a condition that is particularly common in northern countries. Since sunlight is very scarce in these, especially during the cold season, the so-called autumn or winter blues strike. Common symptoms of SAD are: 

Feelings of depression that occur at the same time every year, usually in the fall and winter, but in some cases in the summer as well
A lack of energy, feeling tired and lethargic, sleeping more than usual
Increased appetite, sometimes accompanied by weight gain
Cravings for foods high in carbohydrates and sugar
Difficulty focusing and concentrating on normal daily tasks
More severe symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)
Withdrawal from friends and family
Low libido
Anxiety

Since daylight lamp therapy is primarily used to combat winter depression, it is recommended to start early in the fall to prevent symptoms from first appearing. According to the Harvard University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts, light therapy reduces the symptoms of SAD in 50 to 80 percent of sufferers.

Will buying a light therapy lamp help treat depression?,https://eatbeautiful.net/how-to-use-light-therapy-energy-lamps/," The truth is: I talk to my happy light. I say things like, “Hello, Happy Light” and, “I love you, Happy Light.” Light therapy, and energy lamps like the one I love, are used to treat seasonal depression (seasonal affective disorder [SAD]), insomnia, jet lag and low-energy due to decreased exposure to sun. Despite potential criticism from naysayers of talking to inanimate objects, the fact that I feel so happy in the midst of what would otherwise be the low-energy-winter-blues is evidence that something is working, quite well.I use my light therapy energy lamp from whenever I wake up in the morning until my 16-year-old daughter comes in to borrow it at 7 am. She sits at her desk in front of it while she gets ready for school, until we leave at 7:35.I’ll often take a second turn with mine around noon, or whenever I can squeeze it in before 2 pm (mimicking the sun’s last high point in the sky).After witnessing the startling results, I promptly sent one as a gift to my closest friend across the country, who had also been visited by the darkness of November. And she quickly bought a second one for her husband and daughter.They work.If you suffer from any change in your energy level or mood in the fall/winter, I’m here to say that after thinking about buying one for over a year, I could not be happier with this purchase.How I chose my energy lampI also researched (of course) which one to buy. Here’s the one I bought and why:It’s 10,000 Lux, UV blocked bright white light (the equivalent to being outside on a sunny day).",to treat seasonal depression,neutral,"

Headaches happen when the nerve endings in different parts of your head and neck become irritated. There are many different kinds of headaches that occur for a variety of reasons. Here are some of the most common:
Tension headache
Dull pressure or tightness on both sides of the head and sometimes the neck
Can last anywhere from half an hour to a whole week
Can cause fatigue in some people
Exact cause is unknown—stress appears to be a common trigger

Migraine
Throbbing on one or both sides of the head
Can range from moderate to severe pain
Usually lasts 4-72 hours
Can cause additional symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sounds
Exact cause isn’t entirely understood, but environmental factors and genetics may contribute
Triggers include stress, changes in sleep patterns, certain foods and food additives (like the sweetener aspartame), certain types of medications, and hormonal changes in women

Cluster headaches
Sharp, severe pain that comes on quickly, usually around or behind one eye>
Occur in frequent attacks, or “clusters,” that can go on for weeks or months
Each attack can last 15 minutes to 3 hours

So are people who take combination medications such as Excedrin, which contains caffeine, aspirin, and acetaminophen; people who take combination medications that contain the barbiturate butalbital; and those who take triptans, including sumatriptan (Imitrex), ergots, or opioids, if they take these medications on more than 10 days per month. In fact, butalbital-containing medications and opioids have been shown to increase the risk of a person’s migraine progressing from episodic (occurring zero to 14 days per month) to chronic (occurring 15 or more days per month). Interestingly, the same pain-relieving medications taken for other conditions such as back pain, neck pain, or arthritis usually do not trigger medication overuse headache in people without a pre-existing primary headache disorder.

Chondroitin can safely relieve osteoarthritis pain and should be considered a first-line treatment choice
The hallmark symptoms of degenerative joint disease, or osteoarthritis, are pain, swelling and stiffness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that nearly 1 in 2 people are at risk of developing osteoarthritis by the age of 85. Because there is no known cure for osteoarthritis, medications such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to provide symptom relief. Long-term use of these medications can be problematic, so natural alternatives are sought out by clinicians and patients alike. Chondroitin has surfaced as a key supplement for osteoarthritis; however, study results have been inconsistent. According to a 2015 exhaustive systematic review by The Cochrane Collaboration, chondroitin does, in fact, outperform a placebo in improving osteoarthritis pain.",Chondroitin can safely relieve osteoarthritis pain,yes,"

Presently, it is thought that unlike many medications available to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements have very few side effects. However, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate nutritional supplements do not offer the desired pain relief for all osteoarthritis patients.

Can chondroitin help relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,https://nutritionandhealing.com/2016/12/07/chondroitin-relieves-knee-osteoarthritis/," But before you pop another pill, you should know that a recent clinical study showed a natural alternative can be just as effective — and safer — for OA. And it can even do something that no prescription drug can do. In a study out of Montreal, 194 osteoarthritis sufferers were given either celecoxib (a.k.a. Celebrex) or chondroitin supplements every day for two years. Both groups reported similar levels of pain relief — but the doctors found that the chondroitin group also showed significantly less loss of cartilage volume AND less inflammation in the membrane lining the knee joint. You see, osteoarthritis occurs when the cushiony cartilage lining your joints breaks down.",significantly less loss of cartilage volume,neutral,"

Shao, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs with the 
Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) said: ""This rigorous 
clinical trial offers strong evidence that glucosamine and 
chondroitin can provide significant relief from knee pain for those 
who suffer the most from osteoarthritis.""​Dr. C. Thomas Vangsness, Jr. from the University of California 
agreed that the study supported the use of the supplements. ""This study provides patients with a convenient alternative 
to expensive pain medications. Glucosamine and chondroitin have 
fewer gastrointestinal side effects than non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs,""​ said Vangsness.While the results have been welcomed by industry spokespeople, 
the mainstream media have 'interpreted' the results differently, 
and have chosen a different message for the consumer, with 
headlines such as, ""Supplements no good for arthritis""​ from 
Irish Health, ""Glucosamine, chondroitin not much help for 
arthritic knees""​ from Forbes, and ""2 Top-Selling Arthritis 
Drugs Are Found to Be Ineffective""​ from the New York Times.Hochberg, seeming to agree with the headlines, said that it was 
prudent to recommend against these supplements for patients with 
osteoarthritis, but if the patients chose to take the supplements 
that doctors recommend taking both glucosamine and chondroitin 
sulfate together since they ""may have an additive effect""​ - 
statements that seem contradictory.Interestingly, Hochberg admits to receiving money from 
pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, a fact that raises doubts 
about the choice of Dr. Hochberg as an 'independent' expert to 
comment on the study.Approximately seven million people in the UK alone are reported 
to have long-term health problems associated with arthritis. Around

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2019/08/26/14/02/omega-3-fatty-acids-for-the-management," The following are key points to remember from this American Heart Association (AHA) Science Advisory Statement on omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) for the management of hypertriglyceridemia:
Fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations may be categorized as normal (<150 mg/dl), borderline (150–199 mg/dl), high (200–499 mg/dl), and very high (≥500 mg/dl). Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dl) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥500 mg/dl) are far less frequently observed. Both are likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 AHA Scientific Statement, the n-3 FAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides and these agents are widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. This advisory summarizes the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (>3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents.",omega-3 fatty acids,neutral,"

Although the evidence supporting use of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in the secondary prevention of hypertriglyceridemia is reasonably strong, until there are larger RCTs of better methodological quality, it is not recommended that practitioners treat hypertriglyceridemia with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in lieu of lipid-lowering medications.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids for the Management of Hypertriglyceridemia




                Published: August 19,  2019
            

















Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and very high triglycerides (VHTG) are becoming increasingly prevalent, likely driven by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. This advisory informs providers about newly approved prescription omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) to treat HTG and VHTG. The advisory summarizes clinical evidence on effects of n-3 FA on plasma concentrations of triglycerides and other lipids and lipoproteins in individuals with elevated triglycerides.

The advisory from the American Heart Association aggregates the research performed thus far on the use of omega-3 fatty acids in hypertriglyceridemia and recommends a dose of 4 g/d to observe a therapeutic effect. According to a science advisory from the American Heart Association published in Circulation, 4 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids is a safe and effective treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, both alone and as adjunct therapy to other lipid-lowering agents. Researchers released this advisory as a summary of the lipid and lipoprotein effects of pharmacologic doses (>3 g/d) of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing severe levels of plasma triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL). In 2002, the American Heart Association recommended 2 to 4 g/d for total omega-3 intake (referring to eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) for triglyceride lowering. Since then, the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved prescription agents containing these components together or EPA alone.",safe and effective treatment,neutral,"

To TCTMD, Skulas-Ray stressed that the degree of treatment response to omega-3 prescriptions is determined by the severity of an individual’s triglyceride levels prior to treatment. She also noted that levels are highly variable day-to-day, so the determination of response shouldn’t be based on a single triglyceride measurement. For managing hypertriglyceridemia (200-499 mg/dL), the AHA experts state that prescription-strength omega-3 fatty acids, either with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or EPA plus docosapentaenoic acid (DHA), would be expected to yield a 20% to 30% reduction in triglycerides without any increase in LDL cholesterol. For individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia, 4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce triglycerides by more than 30%, but LDL cholesterol may increase in agents that contain DHA.

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.pharmacytoday.org/article/S1042-0991(19)31223-X/fulltext," “Effective management of hypertriglyceridemia is essential; however, this should be considered in context of other lipid parameters such as elevated LDL levels. My approach to managing patients is to first reduce LDL-C to goal with maximal tolerated doses of statins, then assess the triglyceride levels.”Saseen also discussed the importance of understanding the differences among prescription omega-3 products, as there are EPA-only prescription products and EPA plus DHA combination products. “When selecting between prescription products to manage hypertriglyceridemia, the EPA-only products do not appear to increase LDL levels, whereas the combination products may increase LDL, and some experts have theorized that this may be potentially atherogenic,” Saseen told Pharmacy Today.“The best data we have is from the REDUCE-IT trial, in which the EPA-only product icosapent ethyl (Vascepa—Amarin), when added to statin therapy, resulted in a significant reduction in adverse CV events compared with statin monotherapy in patients with moderate to highly elevated triglycerides.”Highlights of new advisoryThe AHA science advisory states that clinicians should first assess patients for causes of hypertriglyceridemia, including medications (e.g., estrogen or corticosteroids), lifestyle (e.g., excessive alcohol or sugar intake), medical conditions (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes or hypothyroidism), and genetics.Modifiable causes should be addressed before pharmacotherapy is initiated. This may include switching medications and making lifestyle changes, such as reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption, increasing the amount of exercise, and eating a heart-healthy diet.View Large

"
Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://caltonnutrition.com/which-omega-3-is-better-for-lowering-triglyceride-levels/," Our answer is a resounding YES! There is currently little evidence that plant-based oils, like flaxseed, chia seed, hemp seed or echium seed oils, help to lower high triglyceride levels. This is because plant-source omega-3s do not contain EPA or DHA, the ‘long-chain’ omega-3 fatty acids that are present in fish oil, which have been shown to produce the triglyceride-lowering effects and anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Instead, these plant-based seed oils contain a ‘short-chain’ omega-3 called ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which must be converted within the body to EPA, and then to DHA. However, this conversion is problematic because this conversion is very inefficient. In fact, the body only converts ALA to EPA and then to DHA at an efficiency rate of approximately 5 to 10 percent and 2 to 5 percent, respectively.",YES!,neutral,"

Can omega-3 help manage hypertriglyceridemia?,https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3109," Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as current management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.FootnotesSeries explanation: State of the Art Reviews are commissioned on the basis of their relevance to academics and specialists in the US and internationally.",triglyceride,neutral,"

 Dosage and Administration 
The recommended daily dose of P-O3FA for triglyceride reduction in adults is 4 g/day. The daily dose can be taken either as a single 4-g dose (four capsules) or as two 2-g doses (two capsules twice daily). Some cardiology and other lipid specialists may prescribe P-O3FA to reduce the risk of sudden death in post-MI patients at a dose of 1 g/day. [9]

 Goals of Therapy 

 Triglyceride lowering to prevent acute pancreatitis (first priority)  
 Prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) (second priority) 

 Triglyceride Lowering to Prevent Pancreatitis 

 Initiate a very-low-fat diet when triglycerides >1000 mg/dL (>11.29 mmol/L) (<15% of total calories as fat)  
 Discontinue drugs that raise triglycerides. Eliminate alcohol  
 Manage hyperglycemia, if present  
 Initiate weight reduction and increased physical activity  
 Initiate triglyceride-lowering drugs (fibrate or nicotinic acid)  
 Omega-3 fatty acids may be used as adjunctive therapy to lower triglycerides  
 Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors are not first-line agent for very high triglycerides  
 Bile-acid sequestrants are contraindicated as they tend to raise triglycerides 

 Triglyceride Lowering to Prevent CHD 

 Efficacy of drug therapy to prevent CHD in persons with very high triglycerides has not been demonstrated by clinical trials

Objective: This review provides an overview of the use of omega-3 concentrates (both P-OM3 and over-the-counter fish oil) to lower triglycerides in people who have moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides in the range of 150 – 500 mg/dl). The objectives were to examine clinical evidence, describe the magnitude of effects and predict future clinical use of P-OM3. Methods: Published, peer-reviewed studies of omega-3 concentrates were included if they were placebo-controlled, double-blind, of sufficient size to demonstrate triglyceride lowering, and studied a population described as having a mean baseline triglyceride value of 150 – 500 mg/dl. Studies using the 4-g dose of P-OM3 were used to develop a model of percent triglyceride lowering as a function of baseline levels. Results/conclusions: P-OM3 are effective in reducing triglycerides by ∼ 30% in this population and are likely to be combined with other drugs (e.g., statins) to treat combined dyslipidemia.Keywords:: docosahexaenoic aciddyslipidemiaeicosapentaenoic acidethyl esterhypertriglyceridemiaomega-3P-OM3triglycerides

Can probiotics prevent respiratory infections?,https://1md.org/article/probiotics-upper-respiratory-tract-infections," Another review of randomized controlled trials looked at comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute upper respiratory tract infections in both children and adults. The review found that probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of participants who developed an infection, the duration of the infection, and the antibiotic use for participants. While the data looks promising, the results aren’t completely in yet. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the current evidence shows that probiotics may work for reducing the number of upper respiratory tract infections people have and their duration, but more studies are needed to verify these initial results.

Let’s get to the evidence.There is evidence that has proven through a 3-stage, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study that probiotics clearly do help fight respiratory viruses. The 3-stage study was conducted in three different winters between 2003-2007. In all three stages healthy people were used.The following probiotics and compounds were used:Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium lactisLactoferrin (A protein found in colostrum)Prebiotics – (Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) )Stage 1 – 2003/2004 StudyIn this study, 237 people were used. They were broken down into two groups. One was given a formula containing three probiotic strains and FOS (An alternative sweetener) and the other was given a placebo.The results showed that respiratory infections in the group that was given probiotics decreased dramatically.As you can see from the rest of the study, stages two and three produced the same results.The study ultimately determined that regular and daily use of probiotics can reduce the risk and severity of respiratory infections.How Can Probiotics (Bacteria) Possibly Fight Respiratory Viruses?Numerous viruses cause respiratory infections.",probiotics can help prevent respiratory infections,yes,"

This review describes the most recent clinical findings, including safe probiotic therapies aiming to medicate respiratory infections, allergies, cancer, and neurological disorders due to their physiological interconnection. Subsequently, we will describe the major biological mechanism by which probiotic bacteriotherapy expresses its anti-viral, anti-allergic, anticancer, and neuro-stimulatory effects.Keywords: probiotic, anti-viral, anticancer, psychobiotics, mechanisms1.

In 1908 Élie Metchnikoff disclosed that the consumption of fermented dairy products inoculated by starter cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus appeared to improve intestinal microbiota and was associated with promoting longevity in Bulgarian farmers [3]. Lately, in 1912 bacterial-derived probiotic product lactobacillin was promoted by Metchnikoff as a remedy that improves human health and longevity [4].",reduce and prevent the symptoms of respiratory infections,neutral,"

Can aromatherapy massage help manage rheumatoid arthritis?,https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/natural-therapies/aromatherapy-for-arthritis-relief," By Mary Margaret Chappell and Jennifer Davis
Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis, but research shows that it can have a powerful impact on your well-being, including your level of pain. “Certain scents activate smell receptors in the nose, which triggers a reaction in the nervous system,” says Julie Chen, MD, an integrative medicine physician in San Jose, California. This, in turn, stimulates the part of your brain that controls emotion, triggering the release of hormones such as feel-good dopamine. Research corroborates the use of aromatherapy for pain relief. In fact, a study from the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul showed that people with arthritis who sniffed a fragrant blend that included lavender, eucalyptus and rosemary experienced less pain and better moods than those who didn’t. “Aromatherapy is effective because it works directly on the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center,” says Mehmet Oz, MD, director of Columbia University Medical Center's Integrative Medicine Center in New York City.",Aromatherapy won’t cure your arthritis,neutral,"

This short six-week preliminary study had no follow up; therefore, long term intervention effects are unknown. Overall, results suggest both aromatherapy massage and reflexology to be effective non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving RA-related pain and fatigue. Both forms of alternative therapy should be considered as a component of care for symptom management in patients with RA. Further research is needed to determine what other RA-related symptoms beyond pain and fatigue may benefit from aromatherapy massage and reflexology and what the long-term effects of therapy are.

You might need ongoing treatments or tune-up visits when your symptoms of pain and stiffness return.RELATED: Try Aromatherapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Relief“Massage has been shown to be useful in reducing pain temporarily,” explained A. Lynn Millar, PhD, physical therapist and fellow emeritus of the American College of Sports Medicine. And best of all, she added, there's no reason not to include massage as part of your RA treatment. However, The Arthritis Foundation urges you to check with your rheumatologist first before starting any massage therapy to make sure it is appropriate for your individual health needs.Types of Massage Therapy Treatment Options for Rheumatoid ArthritisAlthough there are many types of massage, only two — moderate-pressure massage and myofascial release — have research support for pain relief for RA, but you can explore others as well.Results are encouraging. For instance, in another study led by Field, published in November 2015 in Complementary Therapies in Practice, the research team found participants who received a moderate-pressure massage targeted to the knees reported reduced pain and greater range of motion.

It typically affects your joints, like fingers, shoulders, and knees, but it may affect your eyes, lungs, blood vessels, skin, and heart.Whether arthritis is a disease or a disorder is debatable. Arthritis.org states that the term is an “informal way of referring to joint pain or joint disease.” But some scientists say that it’s a “chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease” that is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.Rheumatoid arthritis is categorized as a type of undifferentiated connective tissue disease. This is a broad term that describes the disease having signs and symptoms of one or more connective tissue diseases, but it doesn’t have specific traits of any one disease. This makes diagnosis and treatments tricky and risky.Because it’s an autoimmune disorder like scleroderma, EDS, and lupus (SLE), your immune cells attack your healthy connective tissues in rheumatoid arthritis.While there’s no cure for RA, there are treatments that can manage your symptoms to stop or slow its progression.What causes rheumatoid arthritis?While no one really knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis, there are some clues in research that show some factors can increase the likelihood of getting RA.Basically, your immune cells get into your joints and their connective tissues from your blood vessels. They “attack” your tissues, causing inflammation and swelling of your joints, which can be painful and quite warm to the touch.One type of antibody called ACPA (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies) has been found to be a highly predictive indicator to having rheumatoid arthritis.GeneticsA change in one or a few genes in some types of proteins that are needed in cell communication (cytokines) have been linked to developing RA.",there are treatments that can manage your symptoms to stop or slow its progression,neutral,"

This short six-week preliminary study had no follow up; therefore, long term intervention effects are unknown. Overall, results suggest both aromatherapy massage and reflexology to be effective non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving RA-related pain and fatigue. Both forms of alternative therapy should be considered as a component of care for symptom management in patients with RA. Further research is needed to determine what other RA-related symptoms beyond pain and fatigue may benefit from aromatherapy massage and reflexology and what the long-term effects of therapy are.

Getting to Know Them
With clients who have arthritis, your intake is likely going to have to be a little longer and more detailed. “Allow a longer time so the client can tell the history of their disease, as well as treatments they’ve previously tried,” advises Nancy Hess, owner of A Still Place in Oak Park, Illinois. “This gives the therapist more information, but more importantly, allows the client to be heard.”

Some information may no longer be current.ShareIt's a traditional remedy as embedded in our culture as downing chicken soup to soothe a cold or putting baking soda on a bee sting: When a child has the croup, surround them with steam to help them breathe.Trouble is, says new Canadian research, the age-old treatment really doesn't work.A study of 140 youngsters who were brought to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children with the telltale seal-bark cough and laboured breathing of the common viral infection found that exposing them to various types of humidity had no effect on recovery.Researchers divided the patients into three groups and administered room temperature water vapour by one of three methods.One group was exposed to mist created by a machine so that its water particles were of an optimal size to reach the vocal cords, larynx and voice box -- the areas that become inflamed and narrowed with croup.The second group had mist from a tube aimed toward the face (considered equivalent to steam vapour), while the third had air at 40-per-cent humidity (the normal level in homes and buildings) delivered through a mask. ""In a nutshell, in mild to moderate croup presenting to an emergency room, the use of humidity, even when it was optimally delivered, did not bring about any further improvement in the children's condition,"" said Dennis Scolnik, lead author of the study, which appears today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.And while mist from a humidifier won't cause any harm, steam from a kettle or a bathroom hot-water tap could be dangerous, he said, noting that cases have been reported of children being scalded or their airways injured. ""People were using steam kettles at home and burning their kids. So that's one of the reasons we wanted to do the study. . . .

""Steam almost always works,"" the AAP public education statement on croup states.It may appear to work, Scolnik says, but it is more likely that a parent's efforts to comfort and calm the sick child are what really help. ""Parents are doing all the right things when they sit in a steamy bathroom with a child with croup, and the setting is warm and comforting,"" he says. ""But the humidity probably isn't adding much.

The Research on Taking Minoxidil Orally for Hair Loss Is LackingSo far, there isn’t enough high-quality research to support oral minoxidil for hair loss. But a handful of small studies suggest that oral minoxidil can help treat hair loss, and may be more effective for some patients than topical treatments, Dr. Sattur says.For example, one small observational study involving 100 women experiencing female pattern hair loss suggested that a daily pill containing 0.25 milligrams (mg) minoxidil and 25 mg spironolactone was safe and effective in treating the condition. But the study did not use a control group, so it’s not clear whether these results are due to the medication.A later review, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in July 2020, looked at 17 studies involving 634 patients.

Can minoxidil treat hair loss?,https://www.health.com/news/oral-minoxidil-hair-loss," Minoxidil—a drug normally used topically to treat hair loss—is beginning to gain traction as an oral medicine for the same reason. Some dermatologists even say that the drug in its oral form regrows hair better (and for less money) than how it's commonly used. The news comes from a recent article from The New York Times, highlighting the use of low-dose oral minoxidil pills—a relatively unknown hair loss treatment by both patients and doctors. Prescribing medication in this way is what's known as off-label use. Though minoxidil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss in topical form (it's the active ingredient in Rogaine), it has not been approved for oral use for hair loss.

The drug was synthesized among many others to create a viable solution for patients suffering from hypertension and the high blood pressure that followed it. But once scientists figured out Minoxidil had a “side effect” of growing unwanted hair in select parts of their bodies, efforts were re-directed to formulate the compound as a solution for hair loss. Although Minoxidil was initially approved by the FDA in 1979 as an oral tablet for treating high blood pressure, it later received another approval in 1988 as a topical solution for treating androgenic alopecia (i.e genetic hair loss) in men and women.

        Abstract


Recent studies have shown that low-dose oral minoxidil (OM) can be a safe and effective treatment of numerous hair disorders including male-patterned hair loss (MPHL) and female-patterned hair loss (FPHL). There are several practical advantages of OM over its topical formulation: enhanced cosmesis, cost-savings, and the possibility of co-therapy with other topical formulations or topicals used for camouflage. This treatment may be particularly helpful for patients who are unable to tolerate topical minoxidil or other systemic treatments. Doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 mg daily are usually used for FPHL and doses ranging from 2.5 to 5 mg/day for MPHL. The low side-effect profile of low-dose OM allows for long-term adherence to the medication and favorable clinical response, resulting in stabilization and improvement of hair loss.",can be a safe and effective treatment of numerous hair disorders,neutral,"

As James Duke detailed in an article published in 1988, eight of the nine plants in Hoxsey’s formula had shown anticancer activity in animal lab tests, five had shown antioxidant properties as protectants against cancer, and all had shown antimicrobial properties against viral and bacterial infections.In other words, Hoxsey’s ingredients did in fact show significant chemical and biological anticancer activity.By 1998, Duke had cross-referenced everything with the extensive USDA database he’d founded, putting together even more evidence on the anticancer properties of the plants in Hoxsey Therapy. And yet, since then, no further official investigations have been conducted on Hoxsey Therapy. The FDA has not revised its position, and neither has mainstream science ventured to conduct new tests.

Decreasing anxiety by taking L-theanine as a supplement, either in the form of capsules or a mug of decaffeinated green tea, appears to be a low-risk way to address your anxiety issues.

Lastly, L-theanine reduces anxiety because it can lower blood pressure. These two conditions have a bidirectional relationship, as anxiety may lead to high blood pressure, and high blood pressure can also trigger feelings of anxiety. Stress and anxiety are known to increase blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. L-theanine fights back on this by reducing the central nervous system’s stress response and stimulating nitric oxide production—a compound that dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, which may reduce anxiety. L-theanine Side Effects

Reduce anxiety. Compared to control groups, young rats given water with 0.3% theanine had much lower stress levels after stress-induction, as noted by markedly reduced serum corticosterone.3

Human Research
Numerous clinical studies support the capacity of L-theanine to relieve anxiety and stress. L-theanine (400 mg) may relieve anxiety symptoms in adults with schizophrenia
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation, 60 adults with schizophrenia were given either a placebo or 400 mg of L-theanine every day for 8 weeks. Outcomes were measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). L-theanine supplementation resulted in a reduction of anxiety (HARS) as well as significant reductions on positive psychopathology scores (PANSS). The study concluded that “L-theanine augmentation of antipsychotic therapy can ameliorate positive, activation, and anxiety symptoms in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients.”4

   Medicinal Properties of Steam Inhalation  

Primarily, the medicinal effect of this at-home therapy is to ease the symptoms of illnesses that cause congestion, runny nose, and sore throat, such as:



The common cold (viral infection of the upper respiratory tract—the nose and throat) 
Sinus infection (sinusitis,  inflammation of the lining of the spaces in your face and head)
Croup (infection of the upper airway, causing a barking cough)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the respiratory tract common in infants and young children)
Bronchitis (inflammation in the lining of the bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs)
Allergies (condition in which your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, causing itchy eyes and skin, runny nose, and nasal congestion)




Steam Inhalation and Sleep

There’s significant evidence that steam inhalation before bed can help with sleep. One study of adult men found this practice to ease bedtime anxiety, shorten the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and improve the quality of rest. Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  

Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.",doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria,neutral,"

Also called steam therapy, it involves the inhalation of water vapor.The warm, moist air is thought to work by loosening the mucus in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs. This may relieve symptoms of inflamed, swollen blood vessels in your nasal passages.While steam inhalation won’t cure an infection, like a cold or the flu, it may help make you feel a lot better while your body fights it off.But as with any home remedy, it’s important to learn best practices so you don’t hurt yourself in the process.What are the benefits?Due to acute upper respiratory infection such as a cold or a sinus infection, the blood vessels of the nasal passage may get inflamed which triggers the stuffy nose.Steam inhalation helps to ease feelings of irritation and swollen blood vessels in the sinus area. Due to therapy, the mucus thins and leads to emptying of the nose easily.This can allow your breathing to return to normal, at least for a short period of time.Steam inhalation may provide some temporary relief from the symptoms of:Common coldFlu (influenza)Sinus infections (infectious sinusitis)BronchitisNasal allergiesApart from this, steam inhalation helps alleviate:HeadacheCongested (stuffy) noseThroat irritationBreathing problems caused by airway congestionDry or irritated nasal passagesCoughIn addition to helping clear the nose and throat, steam therapy is sometimes used to help with chest congestion.For example, in a 2018 study on steam therapy with a small group of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), some participants experienced decreased respiratory rate and easier breathing.Steam therapy may also help people sleep. A 2019 study showed that warm steam inhalation before bedtime helped participants relax and increased deep sleep, which led to improved sleep quality in adult men with mild sleep issues and anxiety.Steam Inhalation and COVID-19The steam inhalation seems a logical solution to COVID infection.",Steam inhalation may provide some temporary relief,neutral,"

It sounds like this is a Russian variant of a common home remedy of inhaling steam as a decongestant. [Examples: The Health Site, WebMD]

The Cochrane Library reviewed the evidence: Heated, humidified air for the common cold. There is not enough evidence to show if steam inhalation improves or exacerbates nasal congestion when a person has a cold
The congestion from the common cold, arising from swelling of the membranes and thickened mucus inside the nose, has been treated for decades with inhaled steam in the hope this makes the mucus drain away easier. Also there is laboratory evidence that cold virus may be sensitive to heat.

Does inhaling steam help treat common cold?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279542/," Some studies have shown that certain extracts of ivy, eucalyptus, primrose, pelargonium (umckaloabo) and thyme can at best slightly relieve a cough.The situation with honey is similar: Honey can probably relieve the symptoms of a cough somewhat in children if they take it either pure or dissolved in water in the evening before going to bed (and before brushing their teeth).Products made from echinacea extracts are also commonly recommended for the treatment of colds. They are claimed to strengthen the body’s immune system. But the research on these products has not led to clear conclusions.Inhaling steam and drinking a lot of fluidsMany people find it pleasant to breathe in (inhale) steam with or without adding things like chamomile or peppermint oil, because the warmth and moisture can have a short-term soothing effect on the mucous membranes lining the nose. But this kind of inhalation doesn't have a clear effect on cold symptoms.Drinking a lot of fluids is also often recommended if you have a cold. There's no scientific proof that this will help, though, so there's no need to force yourself to drink more fluids than you feel like drinking when you have a cold.

Physical activity can help improve your health and quality of life. Not getting enough physical activity can increase your risk for diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and mental health disorders. Current theories about depression suggest that sleep problems, a lack of energy, and physical inactivity can result from a depressed mood. To investigate the relationship between mood disorders and these factors, a team led by Dr. Kathleen Merikangas at NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Dr. Vadim Zipunnikov at John Hopkins University collected real-time measures of physical activity and sleep. The scientists enrolled 54 adults with bipolar disorder, which involves episodes of depression; 91 with major depressive disorder; and 97 with no history of mood disorders.

Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿



More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 


Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿

Replacing one of these with something positive like exercise can help you develop new coping strategies. The Link Between Exercise and Depression   

Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿



More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 


Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿



Of the participants, 75% showed either a therapeutic response or complete remission of symptoms compared to 25% who did not exercise.",exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms,neutral,"

Participants reported on their depression symptoms before a 30-minute cycling session and then again 25 minutes, 50 minutes, and 75 minutes after the workout. A week later, the participants went through the same survey process -- but instead of cycling, they sat still for 30 minutes. The study showed that exercise was associated with improvements in key areas related to depression. The researchers observed notable improvements to the participants’ depressive moods – such as feeling discouraged, sad, or gloomy – 30 minutes after exercise and through the first 75 minutes after exercise. They also noted that anhedonia, or difficulty experiencing pleasure during previously enjoyable activities, also improved after exercise; however, the researchers found that these benefits started to drop off by the 75-minute mark.",The study showed that exercise was associated with improvements in key areas related to depression,neutral,"

The topic is incredibly complex to begin with, and many studies lack the scientific rigor necessary to provide concrete results (Lawlor, 2011; Ströhle, 2008). As such, researchers have performed systematic reviews to combine results from previously conducted studies and make stronger, better justified conclusions. A recent review by Cochrane published in 2013 looked at 39 randomized trials to determine the effect of exercise interventions in the treatment of depression (Cooney et al., 2013).Defining Our Question: There are several questions that might come to mind when we ask, “can exercise improve symptoms of depression”?What kind of exercise are we talking about? : Several exercise interventions are referred to in this paper.",readCan exercise improve symptoms of depression,neutral,"

Exercise can improve depressive symptoms in people with depression. However, similar to other treatments, exercise is not a panacea and may not work equally for all. A seminal study by Dunn et al. (30), the Depression Outcomes Study of Exercise, found a response rate of about 40% in depressed people free from other treatments. These results are comparable with more recent data found in the REGASSA trial, the largest study with exercise and depression, which found a response rate of about 50% (31). The remission rate (people who no longer meet criteria for MDD diagnosis) was evaluated in the Treatment with Exercise Augmentation for Depression (TREAD) study (32) using and adapting (16 kilocalories per kilogram of weight spent in exercise per week) the pioneering idea of Andrea Dunn in determining the exercise dose based on the energetic expenditure did find a remission rate of about 28%.",Exercise can improve depressive symptoms,yes,"

Another systematic review [16], in which only three studies with patients suffering from major depression were included, reported that physical exercise programmes significantly reduced the symptoms of depression, though the conclusions were limited by the heterogeneity and methodological shortcomings of the three studies evaluated.A Cochrane review [17] analysed the relationship between physical exercise and depression. An attempt was made to answer the question of whether exercise might be more effective than drugs, psychological therapy or therapeutic abstention in reducing symptoms of depression. To this end, a total of 39 clinical trials of widely differing quality were jointly analysed. The results showed that: as compared to no treatment or a control group, exercise may have a moderately beneficial effect on symptoms of depression; and as compared to pharmacological treatment or psychological therapy, no differences were in evidence (conclusions based on very few studies). In only 4 trials [18,19,20,21], which covered a total of 298 patients, was physical exercise compared to pharmacological treatment (sertraline), and no statistically significant differences were observed, though only one of these studies specifically targeted persons over the age of 65 years [21] and included only 37 of such subjects.",exercise may have a moderately beneficial effect on symptoms of depression,neutral,"

Can eating dates help manage iron deficiency anemia?,https://livewellzone.com/eating-dates-for-iron-deficiency/," Researchers attribute date’s iron-boosting properties to its iron content, as well as to the fact that it contains multiple nutrients that enhance iron absorption and hemoglobin production.To give you a better idea of how dates can improve both iron and hemoglobin levels, here’s a quick overview of some of those studies.1. Dates Improve Iron Deficiency Anemia in Girls Aged Aged 8 to 10A study published in the journal Pediatric Health, Medicine and Therapeutics showed that adding dates to the diets of young, iron-deficient girls, improves iron and hemoglobin levels (source).Here’s a summary of what the study entailed, as well as the results:At the start of this study, the mean hematocrit (Hct) was 34.24 g/dL, the mean ferritin (standard measure for iron) was 47.07 μg/dL and the mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.19 g/dL.The participants consumed Mazafati dates for 2 months. No other dietary changes were made.After 2 months the girls showed improvements in all categories: mean hematocrit (Hct) was 37.17 g/dL, mean ferritin was 53.98 μg/dL and mean hemoglobin (Hgb) was 12.05 g/dL.Dates contain vitamin A, which helps with the synthesis of hemoglobin. Interestingly, some studies and experts state that vitamin A deficiency tends to go along with anemia. And low vitamin A can decrease iron absorption, further contributing to the development of anemia. Furthermore, another report indicates that taking vitamin A and iron together seems to be more effective at preventing iron deficiency, versus taking them individually (1, 2, 3).Vitamin C is also found in dates and it’s known to enhance iron absorption.From a scientific perspective, the results of this study were considered statistically significant.2.",improves iron and hemoglobin levels,neutral,"

Iron deficiency can also lead to other health issues like chronic hair loss, damaged skin and nails, and pale skin. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)It needs no retelling that the body needs iron to make haemoglobin, which is a protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen to all other organs. As such, if you have iron deficiency, it can lead to anaemia (caused due to low haemoglobin levels). According to the World Health Organization, “anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiologic needs, which vary by age, sex, altitude, smoking, and pregnancy status.”
“Besides anaemia, iron deficiency can also lead to other health issues like chronic hair loss, damaged skin and nails, pale skin,” Dr Dimple Jangda, an Ayurveda expert, wrote in an Instagram post. Agreeing, Dr Sneha Satla, Senior Dietician, Citizens Specialty Hospital, told indianexpress.com that the symptoms of an iron deficiency depend on the severity of anaemia and the overall health of an individual. “However, some common symptoms may include pale skin, fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness and also strange cravings to eat items such ice, clay, and slate pencils,” she explained.",HomeLifestyleHealthFocus,neutral,"

Many people use over-the-counter zinc products to prevent or treat their colds. But can this mineral really help cure the common cold?

One study showed that zinc shortened the duration of symptoms by an average of two days compared with a placebo. In another, zinc lowered the severity of symptoms by a cold’s third day, around the peak of illness.",BMJ Open,neutral,"

Zinc supplements provided modest benefits in preventing and treating common symptoms of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in adults, according to a meta-analysis published in BMJ Open. Cheat sheets: Evidence-based medicine 101
Meta-analysis details 
For the analysis, researchers at Western Sydney University looked at 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 5,446 adults. The trials were published in 17 English and Chinese research databases as recently as August 2020. Notably, the researchers disclosed that none of the trials used in the meta-analysis studied zinc supplements for Covid-19 prevention and treatment. The studies included in the meta-analysis looked at multiple forms of zinc supplements, including lozenges, nasal sprays, and gels.","November 3, 2021",no,"

Can zinc help treat the common cold?,https://www.health.com/mind-body/zinc-colds," Scientists still haven't found a cure, but a new expert review suggests that taking zinc supplements may help ease cold symptoms—and may even prevent the viral infections altogether. Nearly 30 years of research on zinc and colds has had mixed results and has been marred by iffy studies. To get a sound big-picture assessment of zinc's benefits, researchers in India sifted through the evidence and analyzed 15 randomized controlled trials—the ""gold standard"" in medical research—that compared zinc with placebo for the prevention or treatment of the common cold. When they compiled the evidence, the researchers found that healthy adults and children who took zinc syrup, lozenges, or tablets within 24 hours of their first cough or sniffle experienced shorter and less severe colds than the participants who took a zinc-free placebo. Taking zinc reduced the odds that a person would still be experiencing symptoms at the seven-day mark by more than half. Related links:

New Study Reveals Zinc Really Might Help Treat a Cold, But There's a Catch

Health01 November 2021By Carly Cassella

In 1771, the German physician Hieronymus David Gaubius introduced the western scientific community to ""a medication with many promises"" – zinc.More than 200 years later, we can find it amongst the many supplements on pharmacy shelves. It's even known to be one of the rare things that might help fight off a common cold. Or does it? Evidence for zinc supplement use is limited, study results have been mixed, and dosage, formulation and length of prescription have not been investigated properly to date.A new meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials has now strengthened the notion that supplementing zinc could prevent symptoms and shorten the duration of viral respiratory infections, like the common cold or the flu. ""It is commonly thought that zinc's role in preventing and treating infections is only for people who are zinc deficient; our findings really challenge this notion,"" says integrative medicine doctor Jennifer Hunter from Western Sydney University in Australia. ""The two large trials from China found very low dose zinc nasal spray reduced the risk of clinical illness.","

 Washington, Feb 16 (ANI): A team of scientists, including an
Indian-origin researcher, believes that zinc supplements can reduce the
severity and duration of illness caused by the common cold. The findings, based on a review of data from 15 trials, could help
reduce the amount of time lost from work and school due to colds. The idea that zinc might be effective against the common cold came
from a study carried out in 1984, which showed that zinc lozenges could
reduce how long symptoms lasted. Since then, trials have produced conflicting results and although
several biological explanations for the effect have been proposed, none
have been confirmed. The review updates a previous Cochrane Systematic Review, carried
out in 1999, with data from several new trials.","zinc supplements can reduce the

""Zinc lozenges have been shown in numerous studies to shorten the duration of a cold by about a day or two, but ""zinc is not for everyone because a lot of people don't like the taste,"" Schaffner said.Zinc, an essential mineral our bodies need to function properly, is also plentiful in many protein-rich foods, including turkey, so you can probably get enough of it from eating a well-balanced diet.",it is a little something that can help in prevention,neutral,"

Can copper bracelets reduce the pain of arthritis?,https://www.verywellhealth.com/copper-bracelet-arthritis-pain-5097911," One 2013 study looked at the effects of several wearable devices, including copper bracelets, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The study followed 65 participants who each wore either a magnetic wrist strap or copper bracelet for arthritis then self-reported their results. The study found that none of the devices had a statistically significant effect in reducing arthritis symptoms. People didn’t experience better physical function or lower medication use when wearing any of the devices. Researchers concluded that copper bracelets don’t have any meaningful effect, except perhaps a limited placebo effect, on rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.

However, it is important to carry out your own research and find out the most effective treatments possible for a given condition and whether to expect a full cure.In spite of all the evidence advising that copper bracelets are not effective, there may be some benefit to them.They are affordable, and if a patient believes in their effectiveness and comes to no harm from missing out on other, proven treatments, the placebo effect can help symptoms.People looking to treat arthritic swelling and pain should be aware, that any perceived benefits are most likely to occur as a result of the placebo[DRW1] effect.

Some people use pure cocoa butter to help relieve dry skin.Like other natural moisturizers, such as coconut oil, cocoa butter is mostly made up of fatty acids. These fats may help form a protective layer on the skin, preventing moisture from escaping, and therefore stopping the skin from drying out.Some people also use cocoa butter to relieve skin dryness from common skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. While this works for some people, there is no scientific evidence that it will work for everyone.3. Preventing stretch marksMany people believe that cocoa butter can prevent stretch marks from developing, especially during pregnancy.Some doctors and midwives may advise the use of cocoa butter during pregnancy to reduce the risk of stretch marks, but there is no evidence that using cocoa butter will achieve this.One review reports that several studies failed to find any evidence that cocoa butter prevents stretch marks during pregnancy.

Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018.What did the researchers find?Thirty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e.",whether probiotics prevent AAD,neutral,"

A clinical evidence synopsis published in mid-October by JAMA determined that a recent Cochrane review provides moderate-quality evidence for the safe and efficacious use of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children.As the most widely prescribed medications for pediatric patients, antibiotics can be lifesaving, but AAD occurs when these drugs disturb microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics, found in dietary supplements or foods like yogurt, contain blends of nonpathogenic, beneficial bacteria that may competitively inhibit “bad” bacteria and restore balance in the microbial environment.“AAD is unfortunately relatively common, especially in children, albeit somewhat rare in infants,” reported Kim Benner, PharmD, BCPS, FASHP, FPPAG, professor of pharmacy practice and director of postgraduate programs in pharmacy practice at the Samford University McWhorter School of Pharmacy and pediatric clinical pharmacy specialist for Children’s of Alabama.“The article states 11% to 20% [incidence], but some estimates state more like 25% to 30%. I work in a pediatric inpatient environment and tend to see it frequently, but it does occur more commonly on an inpatient basis than outpatient basis,” said Benner.The evidenceThe analysis consisted of 23 randomized, parallel, controlled trials (n = 3,938) involving children aged 0 years to 18 years who were receiving antibiotics. The trials compared treatment with probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment.In the probiotic group, AAD incidence was 8%, compared with 19% in the control group (relative risk 0.46 [95% CI 0.35–0.61]). Of the 16 trials (n = 2,455) that reported on adverse events, none documented any serious events attributable to probiotics.",TopProbiotics can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in childrenJoseph,yes,"

Feature Review: Probiotics for the prevention antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

Should kids taking antibiotics also take probiotics?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract, causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain. Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract and prevent AAD. A team of Cochrane authors based in Canada and the United States worked with the Cochrane IBD group to investigate whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any side effects. Twenty-three studies were included, with a total of 3,938 children, ranging from 2 weeks to 17 years of age, who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD.",probiotics prevent AAD,neutral,"

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,neutral,"

So which ones can help, and when?Kids and DiarrheaSome of the best proof that probiotics work comes from studies of diarrhea in children, especially when it's caused by rotavirus. Probiotics might cut bouts of infectious diarrhea by half a day to about 2 days.Some research shows that the bacteria strains most likely to help are Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, although other strains might be useful. A mix of a few different probiotics may also treat this type of diarrhea.Diarrhea From AntibioticsAntibiotics kill the germs in your body that make you sick, but they also kill some of the good bacteria. This can upset the normal balance in your intestines, leading to diarrhea.Studies of children and adults show that you may cut your chances of having diarrhea if you take probiotics before and during treatment and several days after stopping your antibiotics.

Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,https://www.rand.org/news/press/2012/05/08.html," Researchers from the RAND-based Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted an extensive review of the medical literature to find studies that examined whether probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Researchers pooled results from the studies together to gain a clearer understanding of whether probiotics can prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Use of probiotics was associated with a 42 percent lower risk of developing diarrhea when taking antibiotics as compared to not using probiotics. The RAND analysis estimates that 13 people would need to use probiotics in order to prevent one case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, researchers say the evidence was insufficient to show which type of microorganism was better than another because the included strains were poorly documented and often given as blends of several types. Further, there was no indication that the response varied systematically by a person's age, the duration of antibiotic use or other clinical indications.",probiotic use can prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea,neutral,"

Details for This Review




Study Population: Patients 0 to 18 years of age receiving antibiotics in inpatient and outpatient settings




Efficacy End Points: Incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, mean duration of diarrhea




Harm End Points: Serious adverse reactions; common, nonsevere adverse effects (e.g., constipation, rash, abdominal bloating, gas, nausea, flatulence)




Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract.1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea.2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Antibiotics commonly associated with diarrhea include cephalosporins, lincosamides (especially clindamycin), and aminopenicillins. 3–5 Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is commonly classified as mild to moderate and self-limited, but rare cases of severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been reported and require immediate medical attention to treat electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, toxic megacolon, and pseudomembranous colitis.6,7 




Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.10 




The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6,352 participants.11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis (i.e., diosmectite or infant formula), or no treatment.",Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective,neutral,"

          Background:
        
      
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity. Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib,naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. Search strategy:

Common symptoms include pain, stiffness and swelling, which is why many people seek over-the-counter medications to manage the condition. But as the study suggests, Tylenol isn’t the best option. Acetaminophen isn’t meant to treat inflammation. These drugs treat various aches (headache, muscle ache and toothache) and reduce fever, but they aren’t anti-inflammatory.

Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it? Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling. It is not clear which type is best to use or which causes more side effects: high doses of acetaminophen may cause stomach problems, such as ulcers, and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems.",acetaminophen,neutral,"

A recent systematic review comparing the use of paracetamol versus placebo for treating knee and hip osteoarthritis reported several interesting findings. First and foremost, when it comes to pain, in both the immediate term and short-term , Tylenol only provides marginal improvements. Second, while Tylenol most likely does not enhance physical function immediately, it does provide small improvements in the short-term. With that said, in all instances where benefits were seen, the size of the difference was so small that the authors concluded that taking Tylenol daily likely would not make a meaningful impact on the lives of folks with knee and hip osteoarthritis in the immediate term or short-term.",it does provide small improvements in the short-term,neutral,"

   Treatment  

A variety of treatment methods helps to manage symptoms of mild OA. Based on clinical research, the American College of Rheumatology strongly recommends the following interventions for managing symptoms:



Exercise and physical therapy to improve joint mobility, range of motion, and to strengthen surrounding muscles for joint supportWeight loss to decrease pressure and strain on arthritic joints, especially weight-bearing joints like the hips and kneesModifying activities in order to lessen strain on painful joints



Besides lifestyle changes, your healthcare provider may also recommend medications and devices to help you cope with OA symptoms:



Knee and thumb braces to support painful joints and lessen discomfort from everyday activities
Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief and to reduce inflammation
Topical NSAIDs to decrease pain signals, especially from OA of the hands and knees
Cortisone injections within joints to reduce pain and inflammation



Natural Osteoarthritis Pain Relief Remedies


   Prognosis  

OA is a progressive condition that can slowly get worse over time if left untreated. While there is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, if osteoarthritis is detected early, treatment can help manage symptoms and slow progression and joint degeneration. Lifestyle changes may be needed to help prevent mild osteoarthritis from progressing further to moderate or even severe levels. These include:



Regular exercise to decrease pain and stiffness and strengthen surrounding muscles to support arthritic jointsJoint protection strategies to rest inflamed joints and prevent overuse, which can increase joint wear and tear 



The Prognosis for Osteoarthritis


   A Word From Verywell  

Strengthening the muscles surrounding arthritic joints is essential for decreasing strain on your joints and preventing mild osteoarthritis from progressing to more severe forms of the disease.

Music therapy is a powerful intervention for helping individuals manage stress and reduce the symptoms of depression. You might think that listening to sad music when depressed would make someone feel worse, but studies have shown that people with depression prefer sad music, reporting that they find it soothing and uplifting. Listening to music encourages the production of dopamine, a hormone that makes us feel good, and endorphins, which can induce happiness and relieve pain.

delivered treatment all completed an extensive induction focused on ensuring
fidelity, and videotaped their sessions with participants to monitor adherence. The attention to fidelity is borne out in results that do not vary between
therapists. This suggests that the agent of change is not likely to be the
personality of the therapist or the nature of the particular therapist-patient
alliance (as highlighted by the common factors approach, for example Messer & Wampold

Researchers say that treatment of the disorder with currently available medications provides only modest results. But studies have shown that populations that eat larger amounts of seafood tend to have lower rates of mental disorders linked to personality disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depression. This prompted researchers to investigate whether increasing a person's intake of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish would have any effect on symptoms. The study, published in the January 2003 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, compared the effects of daily fish oil supplementation (one gram of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or E-EPA) in 20 adult women with moderate borderline personality with 10 women who were given a placebo.

The study looked at the effect of taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity. Three important results were reported from this new research:

People with asthma who took Vitamin D supplements as part of their asthma treatment plan were 50% less likely to go to the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital for asthma flares than those who did not take Vitamin D supplements. Taking Vitamin D was linked with needing less glucocorticosteroids following an asthma attack (either injection or tablet form). Patients whose Vitamin D levels were “low” at the beginning of the study experienced the greatest benefit from taking Vitamin D supplements. For these patients, their use of glucocorticosteroids with asthma flares decreased by more than half (55%).",taking Vitamin D supplements on asthma severity,neutral,"

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319617," Not only does the vitamin aid calcium absorption, which is vital for healthy bones, but it also helps to strengthen the immune system. It is the latter function that has led researchers to investigate vitamin D as a possible treatment for asthma.Respiratory infections, such as the common cold or the flu, are known to trigger symptoms of asthma – including airway inflammation, which can bring on an asthma attack.Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may help to lower the risk of respiratory infection-induced asthma attacks by boosting the immune system.To gain a better understanding of this association, Prof. Martineau and colleagues conducted a review of seven randomized controlled trials that looked at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on asthma severity.Asthma events, hospital visits reducedThe review included a total of 955 subjects with asthma, all of whom were receiving standard treatment for the condition.It was found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for asthma-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions by 50 percent when compared with a placebo, with the rate of such events falling from 6 percent to 3 percent.Also, among adults who did experience an asthma attack, vitamin D supplementation reduced the need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections by 30 percent, from 0.43 events per person per year to 0.30 events per person per year.From a subgroup analysis, the researchers found that patients whose vitamin D levels were low at study baseline experienced the greatest benefit from vitamin D supplementation; their need for treatment with steroid tablets or injections fell by 55 percent.Still, they note that the small number of participants in each subgroup makes it difficult to confirm whether or not initial vitamin D levels influence the effect of supplementation on asthma severity.Further clinical trials underwayImportantly, it was also found that vitamin D supplementation was safe for participants at the doses used, and there were no differences in adverse effects between subjects who took vitamin D and those who took a placebo.Overall, the researchers believe that their findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation may be an effective way to help reduce asthma severity.“These results add to the ever growing body of evidence that vitamin D can support immune function as well as bone health.”Prof. Adrian Martineau“Vitamin D is safe to take and relatively inexpensive,” adds Prof. Martineau, “so supplementation represents a potentially cost-effective strategy to reduce this problem.”First study author Dr. David Joliffe, also of QMUL, notes that because the majority of study subjects were adults with mild to moderate asthma, they are currently unable to generalize the findings to children or individuals with more severe asthma.“Further clinical trials are ongoing internationally,” adds Dr. Joliffe, “and we hope to include data from them in a future analysis to determine whether the promise of today’s results is confirmed in an even larger and more diverse group of patients.”AsthmaRespiratoryEmergency MedicineImmune System / VaccinesShare this articleBy Honor Whiteman on October 4, 2017Latest newsParkinson's disease is 50% more common than previously reported, researchers sayWhy females may be less likely to experience brain inflammation than malesWhy racism is a public health threat: Expert perspectivesArtificial sweetener aspartame linked to anxiety, mice study findsAlzheimer's: Brain protein offers clues about higher risk in older womenRelated CoverageIs it safe for people with asthma to wear face masks?People with asthma can have breathing difficulties.

Vitamin D supplements reduced asthma-related hospitalization The team notes that previous studies have associated low vitamin D levels with greater risk of asthma attacks in people with the respiratory condition. As such, researchers have increasingly investigated whether vitamin D supplementation might benefit asthma patients. For their review, Prof. Martineau and colleagues analyzed the data of nine studies – lasting between 6-12 months – that assessed how vitamin D supplementation influences asthma symptoms and asthma attacks.

A Word of Caution
Asthma patients should not stop taking their normal medications, but they should ask their doctors to check their vitamin D status. Any patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 25 nanomoles/Liter might benefit from a supplement. [The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, online Oct. 3, 2017]

Though studies done on people are still needed, taking choline, a B vitamin, may reduce the severity and frequency of asthma attacks, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. High doses (3 grams a day for adults) may be most effective, but you shouldn’t take them without talking to your doctor first.Magnesium: Since people with asthma can have low levels of magnesium, giving them a breathable, spray form of magnesium can open up the bronchial tubes and improve airflow if they’re having a severe attack, according to a June 2016 study published in Drug Design, Development and Therapy.

Can vitamin D supplements improve the management of asthma?,https://www.foxnews.com/health/can-vitamin-d-improve-lung-function-in-asthma," Remember, it is important to always discuss the use of supplements and vitamins (such as vitamin D) with your asthma doctor or allergist. It is not designed to replace your asthma treatment but may have a role in complementing your existing treatment of this condition.What is the right decision for a patient with asthma when it comes to vitamin D? Well it all depends; previous studies have not yet looked at what the benefit of taking vitamin D would have in those with asthma. Longer term research will be necessary to determine the appropriate role of this vitamin going forward although it appears that having a deficiency of vitamin D can possibly lead to worsening asthma.The level of vitamin can help in determining whether indeed you are getting an adequate amount from your diet and/or exposure to sunlight. The levels can vary depending on seasonal factors such as winter-spring vs. summer-fall, when levels are usually higher.

Children and people with frequent severe asthma exacerbations were under-represented; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether vitamin D can reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in these groups.”

Soy formula for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants 

When babies are not exclusively breastfed, evidence suggests that using a soy formula instead of a cow's milk formula does not reduce allergies in infants and children. Infant formulas have been designed to try to lower the chances of developing allergy or food intolerance. These formulas include hydrolysed cow's milk and soy formulas. A review of trials found that in infants at high risk of allergy who are unable to completely breastfeed, there is no reduction in allergies in later infancy and childhood associated with feeding soy formula compared to a cow's milk formula. No eligible studies were found that compared a soy with a hydrolysed protein formula. Authors' conclusions:

Adgent, MSPH, PhD, formerly of NIEHS, now at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Adgent said, “Modern soy formula has been used safely for decades. However, our observational study found subtle effects in estrogen-responsive tissues in soy-fed infants, and we don’t know if these differences are associated with long-term health effects.”
Some mothers who don’t breastfeed have long used soy formula as an alternative to cow-milk formula, often from concerns about milk allergies, lactose intolerance, or other feeding difficulties. However, soy protein contains high amounts of genistein, an estrogen-like compound. Like other estrogen-mimicking chemicals found in the environment, genistein can alter the body’s endocrine system and potentially interfere with normal hormonal development. In laboratory studies genistein causes abnormal reproductive development and function in rodents, but little is known about its effects on infants.",if these differences are associated with long-term health effects,neutral,"

Infants can be allergic to baby formula. Caregivers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of a formula allergy and take steps to address the symptoms if they occur. Diagnosing the cause of the allergic reaction is necessary to ensure that a child can be put on a feeding routine that will be nourishing and not exacerbate their allergy.

Does Chitosan Help with Weight Loss? By
			Sue Roberts  |  
Submitted On June 26, 2007




































Chitosan is a type of fiber which is made from the shells of crustaceans, such as shrimp, lobster, squid or crab. The human body does not digest fiber well, and as it passes through the digestive tract it can bind fats. This causes them to be unabsorbed, too. Since chitosan is a fiber, it was thus hypothesized that it could be effective for weight loss by reducing fat absorption.The majority of studies done have not confirmed this, however.",Sue Roberts,no,"

Getting physical activity is an important part of managing osteoarthritis. But if you aren’t currently active, it’s important to start an exercise routine as soon as you start to have pain. A variety of land and water exercises can improve your hip muscles and OA pain, including strengthening, aerobic and flexibility activities. A physical therapist can develop a specific program of hip strengthening and flexibility exercises to help get your pain under control. Overall, it’s important to get moving and maintain the activities you enjoy in daily life for as long as possible.

(Reuters Health)—Water- or land-based exercise should provide some short-term benefit in pain management for hip osteoarthritis, though there are few well-designed trials testing it, according to a new review. You Might Also Like

“It is nice to finally have some hip-specific data, as hip and knee osteoarthritis are often grouped together, and it’s almost certain that there are differences between these groups of patients, as well as differences in those with multiple joint osteoarthritis,” says Dr. Amanda E. Nelson of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill, N.C., who was not part of the new study. ad goes here:advert-1ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE“However, the studies are still small and heterogeneous, and larger, longer-term studies of more specific interventions are certainly needed to provide more specific recommendations,” she says. The review only considered pain, not joint function, which may also improve with physical activity, Nelson told Reuters Health by email. ad goes here:advert-2ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUEThe researchers, led by Kay M. Crossley of La Trobe University in Bundoora, Australia, reviewed 19 studies of water-based or land-based exercise therapy or manual therapy for hip pain, 10 of which were designed specifically for hip osteoarthritis. Four studies found short-term benefits, up to three months later, with water-based exercise compared to minimal pain management.",minimal pain management,neutral,"

Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.ptvitals.com/blogs/news/hip-osteoarthritis-exercises," Here are 5 of the best exercises and stretches that will help you improve mobility and relieve pain. Low-to-Moderate Intensity Aerobic Exercise
Low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise is one of the best forms of exercise for anyone, but especially for those with hip arthritis. It helps improve your cardiovascular health and boosts the circulation of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints. What type of aerobic exercise is best depends entirely on your personal preferences and how you experience hip osteoarthritis. Here are some of the best: 

Walking and hiking 
Swimming 
Cycling (use an electric bike to reduce and control the difficulty if you live in a hilly area) 
Horseback riding 
Aerobic dance exercise, such as Zumba 
Yoga and pilates, just make sure it’s not too hard on the hips 

Whatever you choose, make sure you start slowly and make it harder over time.",make sure you start slowly and make it harder over time,neutral,"

"
Will at-home exercises manage hip osteoarthritis pain?,https://www.alwaysfysio.nl/en/hip-osteoarthritis-exercises/," By making the back stronger, it becomes stiff less quickly. The exercise goes like this:

Lie on your back with your legs bend
Lift your hips
Hold this for 10 seconds
Repeat it 3 times

You can find the exercise in this video. When the exercise becomes too easy, you can extend one leg and hold this for 10 seconds. Alternate between both legs 3 times. Conclusion
As you can see, there are many physical therapy exercises that you can do to reduce the pain of your hip osteoarthritis. If your complaints do not disappear with these exercises, you can always email me.",If your complaints do not disappear,neutral,"

Using the bike in your home allows you to avoid traffic and stop when you feel strained.Water exercises Freestyle swimming provides a moderate workout. Walking in water up to your waist lightens the load on your joints while also providing enough resistance for your muscles to become stronger. This can greatly improve pain and daily function of the hips. YogaRegular yoga can help improve flexibility of the joints, strengthen muscles, and lessen pain. Some yoga positions can add strain to your hips, so if you feel discomfort, ask your instructor for modifications.",This can greatly improve pain and daily function of the hips,neutral,"

Always begin with stretching or other ROM exercises to prepare the body for strength and aerobic exercises.Respect pain: When the hip or other body parts feel painful, stopping for a while or adjusting the exercise to a more tolerable level can help.Physical therapists recommend people modify activities as necessary. Arthritis symptoms may come and go. A person should try to stay active and perform activities based on what feels tolerable at the moment.Home remediesAside from exercise, a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis.Alternative remedies are things people can introduce to their daily routine at home. These include:Hydration: Drinking enough water may help the body produce synovial fluid, keep joints lubricated, flush out toxins, and reduce inflammation.Assistive devices: Using aids such as reachers may help people avoid positions that cause pain. Walking supports can help improve mobility while distributing the weight outside of the body, reducing stress on the joint.Diet: Following a balanced diet can help a person maintain a moderate weight and reduce pressure on the hip joint.Heat and cold therapy: Applying hot and cold compresses may improve joint stiffness and swelling.",a person can do other things to help manage hip arthritis,neutral,"

4 Strengthening Exercises for Hip Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common ailments affecting nearly 3 million people in the United States each year. It’s a chronic condition involving the bones and cartilage within a joint. OA is the breakdown of the cartilage within a joint that results in exposed bone. When this condition occurs, it causes bone on bone friction, resulting in pain, stiffness, loss of motion, decreased stability and/or the formation of bone spurs. Related: Arthritis – Not Just an Issue For The Elderly
The hip is a ball and socket joint that consists of the thigh bone (femur) and it’s articulation on the pelvis known as the acetabulum. The hip joint provides a high range of motion allowing the femur to move freely through a 360° circle.","

11 Hip-Strengthening Moves for Osteoarthritis



HealthCentral reports on the best strength training and mobility exercises for hip osteoarthritis (OA) according to HSS physical therapist Meghan Lamothe PT, DPT, OCS, ATC.Some pain when you move is normal with OA, but that shouldn’t stop you from exercising, explained Lamothe. Lamothe counseled to follow her three-point rule: Before physical activity, rate the pain from zero to 10. If the pain goes up by more than three points—say, from a three to a seven—you’ve done too much. Stop and rest. If the pain comes back down, you can continue.","If the pain comes back down, you can continue",neutral,"

Chair Squats
The majority of osteoarthritis cases occur in the lower body. The aim of completing exercises is to strengthen the muscles surrounding your painful joints to help better support them and reduce the strain placed on them during day-to-day tasks. One of the best exercises anyone can complete at home, at the gym or your local community center are chair squats. This exercise engages your quadricep muscles (top of the thigh), gluteal muscles (your bottom muscles), hip stabilizers, and your abdominals helping to strengthen both the hip, knee and ankle joints. After completing a structured exercise program including chair squats, you’ll notice a reduction in pain when standing up from chairs, climbing or descending stairs and even when out walking around the block.

In addition, its composition in organic silicon helps to better fix calcium for the joint.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/antioxidants-fertility_n_3697596," ""This has not been disproven by this review. We just didn't have high enough quality evidence to prove or disprove it."" All told, the studies included in the review included more than 3,500 women who were attending fertility clinics.An earlier Cochrane review, on which Showell was also lead researcher, found that antioxidant use by male partners in couples undergoing fertility treatment was linked to higher birth rates, although the researchers cautioned that placebo-controlled studies would need to confirm the finding. The theory is that antioxidants help improve sperm quality by reducing oxidative stress, which could have a big impact, given that 30 percent to 80 percent of cases of male infertility are due to such sperm-related problems caused by oxidative stress.Resolve, the National Infertility Association, estimates that one-third of infertility cases are attributed to the female partner, one-third are attributed to the male and the remaining third are caused by some combination of both partners, or are simply unexplained. ""Oftentimes, patients latch on to something they heard made a difference for this person or that person,"" said Vitek, who said there may be some secondary gain from the placebo effect of taking antioxidant supplements. But in general, she counsels women who are undergoing fertility treatments to simply adopt as healthy a lifestyle as they can -- to exercise and eat well and attempt to manage their stress.Advertisement

Most of the men in the trials had either low sperm counts or sperm that were poor swimmers. The couples had typically been trying to conceive for a year without success.Only three trials looked at the effect of taking antioxidants on live birth rates, making the findings extremely tentative. Across these trials, the number of women who gave birth to live babies rose from a mean of two for every hundred couples to nine for every hundred when the men took antioxidant supplements.In the best-case scenario, antioxidants improved live birth rates from two to 20 babies per hundred couples, but in the worst case, they rose from two to 3.8.The live birth rate with antioxidants was still very low compared to couples with no fertility issues. If 100 healthy couples tried to conceive for a year, the expected success rate would be about 80%.The majority of studies looked at whether a man's consumption of antioxidants improved pregnancy rates.",if the fertility problem was known to lie with the man,neutral,"

        Do supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile men? Background
        A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. Many subfertile men undergoing fertility treatment also take dietary supplements in the hope of improving their fertility. Fertility treatment can be a very stressful time for men and their partners.

Will taking antioxidant supplements treat fertility problems?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidant-supplements," Because free radicals can contribute to muscle fatigue and damage, it’s been proposed that taking antioxidant supplements can blunt their harmful effects, hence improving exercise performance and muscle recovery (7).However, several studies have shown that taking antioxidant supplements — specifically vitamins C and E — can interfere with how your body adapts to exercise and even eliminate some of the health benefits associated with exercise (8, 9, 10, 11).May Increase Cancer RiskThe oxidative stress caused by free radicals to the body’s cells is thought to be a major contributor to the development of cancer (12). Since antioxidants neutralize free radicals, taking antioxidant supplements have been speculated to decrease the risk of developing or dying from cancer (13).Several meta-analyses, however, have shown that taking antioxidant supplements does neither reduce the risk of many types of cancers nor reduce the risk of dying from them once diagnosed, In fact, they may even increase the risk of certain cancers (14, 15, 16, 17).In addition, several meta-analyses have found that beta-carotene supplements, a precursor of vitamin A, increases the risk of bladder cancer, and, in people who smoke, the risk of lung cancer as well (18, 19, 20, 21).The exception is selenium, which may help prevent cancer in people with low levels of the mineral or in people with an elevated risk of cancer. However, more research is needed before selenium can be recommended for this purpose (16, 22, 23, 24).May Cause Birth DefectsVitamin A is important for fetal growth and development, but at high doses, vitamin A supplements can increase the risk of birth defects (25, 26). Therefore, women who might be or are pregnant should not take high doses of vitamin A supplements (27).These supplements are only recommended for pregnant women in areas where vitamin A deficiency is prevalent, such as in Africa and Southeast Asia (28, 29). Beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, is not shown to lead to birth defects. But since taking the supplement long-term is associated with cancer, pregnant women should consult with their physician before taking beta-carotene supplements (30, 31).Summary While they’re thought to be healthy, taking antioxidant supplements may reduce the health benefits of exercise and increase the risk of certain cancers and birth defects.",increase the risk of certain cancers and birth defects,no,"

A Cochrane review of 50 clinical trials found low quality evidence that antioxidants may be associated with an increased live birth rate of around 25-40%. While the review couldn’t find associations for every antioxidant studied, they did find an association between CoQ10 and increased pregnancy rates. Antioxidants have also been shown to improve live birth rate for couples undergoing fertility treatment.

The results revealed that the change in sperm concentration differed between the antioxidant group (median −4.0 million/mL) and placebo group (+2.4 million/mL). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for changes in sperm morphology, motility, or DNA fragmentation.Furthermore, live birth rates did not seem to differ after six months between the antioxidant (15%) and placebo (24%) groups.However, the authors note that recruitment was stopped before it reached the desired number of participants because no benefits were seen in the antioxidant group.
