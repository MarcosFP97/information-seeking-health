Can taking a vitamin D supplement prevent infection with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Answer From Daniel C. DeSimone, M.D. It is not clear if vitamin D supplements help prevent COVID-19 infection. You can help prevent infection from the COVID-19 virus by following these steps:

Can vitamin D cure COVID-19?,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20221115/Vitamin-D-can-reduce-severity-and-spread-of-COVID-19.aspx," It was determined that vitamin D serum concentrations inversely correlated with the decline in COVID-19 infection risk. The overall treatment elicited by vitamin D serum level interaction was considerable, with a 12% rise in the hazard ratio for each category of serum level. A 25% reduction in COVID-19 risk throughout the spectrum of cumulative dosages and a 27% reduction across average daily dosages were also noted. The cumulative dose-response relationship was inversely related to vitamin D blood concentration. Overall, the study findings showed that vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection and death within 30 days. Therefore, the researchers believe vitamin D3 supplementation could be a valuable strategy for limiting the spread of COVID-19 infection and related death and racial differences in COVID-19 outcomes.Journal reference:

And while high levels of vitamin D might lower your risk for severe COVID-19 infection, there is no evidence that taking vitamin D supplements will provide protection against infection or improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.Vitamin D and Other ConditionsNot getting enough vitamin D may lead to or worsen these health problems:Heart diseaseHigh blood pressureDiabetesInfections and issues with your immune systemCertain types of cancer like colon, prostate, and breast cancersMultiple sclerosisPneumoniaBlood clotsAll these can raise your risk for severe COVID-19 if infected.Research shows that obesity and diabetes are linked to low levels of vitamin D. They’re also associated with higher death rates or severe COVID-19 symptoms.How to Get More Vitamin DMore sunlight and foods rich in vitamin D are the best ways. Try to get 15-20 minutes of sunlight, three days a week. And eat foods like:Oily fish (like salmon or sardines)Red meatEgg yolksFoods with vitamin D addedSupplements are also an option.

Can vitamin D cure COVID-19?,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vitamin-d-supplementation-appears-to-offer-protective-benefits-against-covid-19," Patients receiving both vitamin D2 and D3 were dropped from the analysis, as were people who had their first dose of vitamin D supplementation during the pandemic, since the authors said those patients likely had not been taking the therapy long enough to achieve a benefit.After exclusions, the investigators were left with a study population of 220,265 people who received vitamin D3 supplements, 34,710 people who received vitamin D2, and 407,860 patients who received neither.The investigators found that patients who filled a vitamin D2 prescription were 28% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19, and patients who filled a vitamin D3 prescription were 20% less likely to become infected (hazard ratios [HR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65, 0.79; and HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.83, respectively.) Likewise, 30-day mortality rates following COVID-19 were lower in patients receiving supplementation, though the authors cautioned that the reduction for people taking vitamin D2 did not reach statistical significance (vitamin D2 HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.04; vitamin D3 HR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.75).“These associated reductions in risk are substantial and justify more significant exploration and confirmation using [randomized controlled trials],” Gibbons and colleagues wrote. “This is particularly important given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency in the US population and COVID-19.”The investigators also found notable differences across subgroups. Black patients, for instance, had a greater reduction in COVID-19 infection rates when taking vitamin D3 than did White patients. The authors noted that people with darker skin tend to have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.“[T]hese results suggest that expansion of vitamin D supplementation may potentially reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes,” the authors said.Gibbons and colleagues also found that participants who received higher doses of vitamin D had greater benefits, and that veterans who had vitamin D blood levels between 0 and 19 ng/ml before supplementation had the largest decrease in infection risk.The authors listed a number of limitations to their study.

It is also possible that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of getting infected with COVID-19, however that makes less immunological sense. Could vitamin D be used to treat patients with COVID-19? Supplementing vitamin D may play a role in treating patients, but the data is relatively weak at this time.

They will assess the impact of various dosages of the vitamin on COVID-19 symptoms and antibodies, as well as on symptoms of other respiratory diseases. Given the results of Neale’s large-scale study and the modest benefits found in Martineau’s latest meta-analysis, it seems unlikely that vitamin D will prove to be a critical ingredient in fending off COVID-19 or modulating its severity.

Additionally, increased time spent indoors due to strict lockdowns and shielding triggered concerns that some people might not obtain the necessary physiological levels of vitamin D from sunlight.On Dec 17, 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in collaboration with Public Health England and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, published an updated rapid review of recent studies on vitamin D and COVID-19. Their recommendations support the current government advice, revised in April, 2020, during the first lockdown in the UK, for everyone to take vitamin D supplements to maintain bone and muscle health during the autumn and winter months. The recommendations are also in line with new guidance from the UK government, released on Dec 22, 2020, allowing extremely clinically vulnerable people to opt in to receive a free 4-month supply of daily vitamin D supplements—similar to an initiative launched earlier in Scotland. However, the rapid review concluded that sufficient evidence to support vitamin D supplementation with the aim of preventing or treating COVID-19 was still lacking and that the topic should be further investigated. Experts studying vitamin D welcomed the call for more research, but the lack of specific recommendations in the context of COVID-19 was also met with disappointment by many in the scientific community who have argued that vitamin D supplementation is generally safe and that any potential low toxicity would likely be strongly outweighed by any potential benefits in relation to protection from COVID-19.NICE should continue to monitor new evidence as it is peer-reviewed and published, including results from several clinical trials on vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes that are currently underway.",preventing,neutral,"

Vitamin D's effect on Covid-19 may be exaggerated. Here's what we know




      Research has shown that vitamin D deficiency impairs the immune system, and some studies have found vitamin D supplements may reduce the risk of respiratory virus infections and calm immune system overreaction. During the early days of the pandemic, physicians on the front lines began noticing people with lower levels of vitamin D appeared to have a higher risk of dying from Covid-19. Suddenly, the internet was flooded with speculation that taking supplemental doses of vitamin D – even if not needed – would prevent the coronavirus from taking hold. However, “unlike vitamin C, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can ‘build up’ in the system and cause toxicity if taken at very high doses over long periods,” Martineau explained.",may be exaggerated,neutral,"

Vitamin C is one of the nutrients of interest in COVID-19 cure and prevention. Vitamin C may have a number of immune-modulatory mechanisms that can help to mitigate or reduce COVID-19 pathophysiology (4, 5, 9–11). Vitamin C may act as an antioxidant (9–11). Vitamin C supplementation is thought to help reduce oxidative damage and thus prevent worsening internal vascular endothelial injury (4).

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-coronavirus," High doses are being studied for their potential to decrease lung inflammation, but more research is needed.Vitamin C and COVID-19In an article published in the Chinese Journal of Infection Diseases, the Shanghai Medical Association endorsed the use of high dose vitamin C as a treatment for hospitalized people with COVID-19 (10).Doses that are magnitudes higher than the DV are recommended to be given through IV to improve lung function, which may help keep a patient off of mechanical ventilation or life support (10, 11, 12).Additionally, a 2019 review found that both oral and IV high dose vitamin C treatment may aid people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for critical illnesses by reducing ICU stay length by 8% and shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% (13).Chinese researchers have also registered a clinical trial to further study the effectiveness of IV vitamin C in hospitalized people with COVID-19 (14).However, it’s important to note that vitamin C is not yet a standard part of the treatment plan for COVID-19 because evidence is still lacking (10, 15). Though high dose IV vitamin C is currently being tested to see if it can improve lung function in people with COVID-19, no evidence suggests that high doses of oral vitamin C supplements can help with the disease. In fact, they can cause complications like diarrhea (2).SummaryHigh dose IV vitamin C has been used in China to help improve lung function in people with COVID-19. However, vitamin C’s effectiveness is still being tested. There’s no evidence to support the use of oral vitamin C supplements for COVID-19.Do you need to supplement?Currently, no evidence supports the use of oral vitamin C supplements to prevent COVID-19.Vitamin C may help shorten the duration and severity of colds caused by other viruses, but this is no guarantee that it will have the same effect on the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Additionally, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin.

Vitamin C is also found in high concentrations in leukocytes and implicated in several immune responses and functions [13]. Emerging evidence in preclinical studies indicated that vitamin C played a crucial role in ameliorating the effects of inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production, assisting immunoregulation, neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protecting host cells [14, 15]. Hypovitaminosis C was ubiquitous in critically ill patients, and approximately 40% of the patients had a severe deficiency [16], while the low vitamin C serum level cannot be corrected by oral supplementation due to the issue of pharmacokinetics [17]. In a latest research, of 18 adult ICU patients COVID-19 who met ARDS criteria, 94.4% had undetectable vitamin C levels and 1 patient had low levels [18]. Thus, high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) was added to the standard therapy of critically ill patients in recent studies, such as sepsis [19,20,21], ARDS [21, 22], cardiac surgery [23], and burn [24].",antiviral therapy alone may be insufficient,neutral,"

In this context, vitamin C may have positive outcomes on this acute viral infection. Moreover, vitamin C may alter susceptibility to respiratory tract infections by promoting coronavirus resistance [14, 30]. In fact, vitamin C-deficient people are prehensile to severe respiratory infections [3, 31], and supplementation with vitamin C may reduce this infection [31]. Therefore, the intervention to use vitamin C to treat COVID-19 infection is not worth surprising. However, in this review, we will outline the possible role of vitamin C supplementation to minimize COVID-19 pandemic complications.Epidemiological and clinical observations during COVID-19Several clinical and epidemiological investigations outline the hypothesis regarding vitamin C status and its association with COVID-19.",vitamin C may have positive outcomes,neutral,"

Cleveland Clinic researchers have found that zinc or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) – or a combination of the two – do not significantly decrease the severity or duration of symptoms in COVID-19-positive patients, when compared to standard care. The study was published today in JAMA Open Network. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been widespread speculation about the role of various vitamins and supplements to prevent or treat it, but there remains limited scientific evidence. Zinc is known to be important for immune function. It also has a role in antibody and white blood cell production and can fight infections. Vitamin C, an antioxidant, can help reduce damage to cells, and has shown to be immune-boosting.",Cleveland Clinic,neutral,"

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.uchealth.org/today/effectiveness-of-vitamins-c-and-d-against-covid-19/," Many studies point to the beneficial effect of vitamin D on the immune system, especially regarding protection against infections. In developing their prophylactic COVID-19 protocol, the EVMS researchers noted that U.S. patients with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to be hospitalized. They also observed that nations with low average levels of vitamin D were more likely to experience serious outbreaks and higher mortality rates. EVMS included vitamin C in their protocol because it’s a potent antioxidant that’s critical to the immune-cell function. They cite a large-scale study of more than 11,000 patients showing that vitamin C reduces the risk of contracting colds. They also cite research showing that vitamin C reduced the symptoms of colds, about 25% of which are caused by other coronaviruses.",vitamin C reduces the risk of contracting colds,neutral,"

ABERDEEN: Vitamin C is a common remedy that some people believe will cure the common cold and flu.Although it helps us maintain good immune function, however, there’s little evidence that it can prevent or substantially reduce either of these diseases.Yet, in the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak, some “influencers” are claiming that taking mega-doses of vitamin C can cure COVID-19.So let’s cut to the chase. Can vitamin C cure the coronavirus?Considering that novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses – coronaviruses – as the common cold and flu, it’s unlikely that taking vitamin C will prevent or cure you of a COVID-19 infection.CAN VITAMIN C TREAT THE COMMON COLD?Using vitamin C to treat the common cold was an idea popularised by double Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling, and further promoted by the dietary supplements industry. Unfortunately, ever since Pauling’s claim in the 1970s, there has been little evidence to back it up.Vitamins or “vital-amines” were first discovered at the beginning of the 20th century as elements present in low amounts in our diets that were vital for health.",vitamin C is unlikely to cure coronavirus,no,"

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/vitamin-protect-you-covid-19-coronavirus-disease-3534829/," One of the biggest problems with vitamin C studies is that most do not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Supplementation is unlikely to show an effect in people whose vitamin C levels are already high. COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about it. But several studies in other infections or conditions suggest it may be beneficial in certain groups of people, particularly those already deficient in vitamin C who develop COVID-19. Currently, at least two trials are underway specifically investigating the use of vitamin C to treat severe COVID-19, one in New York and one in China. Beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation have been reported for

Elderly people with acute respiratory infections
Recurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome

Can vitamin C cure COVID-19?,https://www.nutraingredients-asia.com/Article/2022/08/24/vitamin-c-d-supplementation-have-potential-as-adjuvant-therapy-for-covid-19-review," In a review titled “The Role of Diet and Supplements in the Prevention and Progression of COVID-19: Current Knowledge and Open Issues”​ published in the journal Preventive Nutrition and Food Science, researchers said the most robust results from human studies involve vitamin C, which could decrease inflammatory markers and suppress cytokine storm.Meanwhile, for vitamin D, there is evidence that it could significantly reduce the need for intensive care if hospitalised for COVID-19.“Natural compounds have been shown to exert antiviral, antifibrotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, which might synergise as prophylactic or supportive agents to reduce some typical COVID-19 symptoms.​“Furthermore, a healthy nutritional status has been reported to support immune function and prevent the onset of severe infection. This suggests the potential role of a healthy diet together with dietary supplements as co-adjuvants in treating COVID-19 and possibly even in the prevention of severe forms of the disease,” ​said the researchers.Therefore, the team aimed to critically review the current evidence on the impact of diet and different dietary components on the prevention and progression of COVID-19. The analysis was categorised according to nutrients, like vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, and probiotics.Different nutrients, different impact​Vitamin C supplementation has been known to improve the immune system, reduce the risk, severity and duration of different infectious diseases, and exert antiviral effects on illnesses like the common cold and pneumonia. These effects were demonstrated through studies done by Marik et al​. (2017), Kim et al.​ (2018) and Ran et al.​ (2018). However, the actual clinical relevance and optimal efficacy of its dosage in preventing and treating infections remain unknown.Alamdari et al.​’s work in 2020 showed that oral or intravenous administration of vitamin C with other substances improved survival rates, whereas Hiedra et al.​’s (2020) study showed the nutrient was linked to decreased inflammatory markers.Despite various promising clinical studies, further clinical trials are needed to fully delineate the effects of vitamin C on COVID-19 infection and recommend its supplementation.The possible association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 has also been investigated in several studies.According to a meta-analysis by Pal et al.​ (2022), vitamin D supplementation might be associated with improved clinical outcomes, especially when administered after the diagnosis of COVID-19.",could decrease inflammatory markers and suppress cytokine storm,neutral,"

A large number of studies have confirmed that high-dose vitamin C can benefit patients with lung injury caused by various inflammatory diseases, especially ARDS and sepsis [27, 30, 33, 34]. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the efficiency and safety of high-dose vitamin C in patients with COVID-19. High-dose vitamin C could decrease mortality and improve the oxygen support status of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, high-dose vitamin C remarkably reduced serum hs-CRP and PCT levels in COVID-19 patients (Figure 3A, 3B).

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/multiple-shots-bcg-vaccine-protect-type-1-diabetics," The BCG-vaccinated group also displayed protective effects against other infectious diseases, including fewer symptoms, lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient. No BCG-related systemic adverse events occurred. BCG’s broad-based infection protection suggests that, in addition to COVID-19, may potentially provide protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens. The researchers are hoping the results will spur a larger scale study of the effects of the BCG vaccine in patients with type 1 diabetes, considered among the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19. The BCG vaccine is an avirulent tuberculosis strain Mycobacterium bovis historically given to protect against tuberculosis and, since its introduction in 1921, has been the most widely administered vaccine in the history of medicine.

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.632478/full," Specifically, the study indicated that BGC vaccinated healthcare workers were less likely to suffer COVID-19 related symptoms (fatigue, dry cough, and muscle aches), were associated to have a reduced rate of testing positive either with a COVID-19 diagnosis by a medical doctor or a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and had a significantly lower positive serology against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) (62). Overall, these finding suggest that BCG vaccination may mitigate sickness associated with COVID-19 infection and ongoing clinical trials are aimed at specifically address this question. Since the BCG vaccine has proven protection against viral respiratory infections, several laboratories are exploring the possibility that the BCG vaccine could be used alone or synergistically to reduce COVID-19 disease severity. Nowadays, around 20 controlled randomized clinical trials ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, Germany, Greece, the United States, Egypt, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Denmark, and France (Table 1) to evaluate whether the BCG vaccine decreases the incidence and the severity of COVID-19. The importance of establishing age groups that might be protected against SARS-CoV2 infection by BCG-vaccination is evident, as well as the timing of the vaccine before potential exposure to the virus, as this may determine whether the BCG-vaccine is effective. This represents a critical step to assess the potential of BCG-vaccination to protect the elderly against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infectious agents.",BCG vaccination may mitigate sickness associated with COVID-19 infection,yes,"

The findings raise the possibility that a vaccine already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may help prevent coronavirus infections or reduce severity of the disease.The vaccine, known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was developed between1908 and 1921 and is administered to more than 100 million children around the world every year. In the U.S., it is FDA-approved as a drug to treat bladder cancer and as a vaccine for people at high risk of contracting TB. The BCG vaccine is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials worldwide for effectiveness against COVID-19.In the new study, published online Nov. 19 in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, investigators tested the blood of more than 6,000 healthcare workers in the Cedars-Sinai Health System for evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and also asked them about their medical and vaccination histories.They found that workers who had received BCG vaccinations in the past—nearly 30% of those studied—were significantly less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood or to report having had infections with coronavirus or coronavirus-associated symptoms over the prior six months than those who had not received BCG. These effects were not related to whether workers had received meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations.The reasons for the lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in the BCG group were not clear, according to Moshe Arditi, MD, director of the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division at Cedars-Sinai and co-senior author of the study.",reduce severity of the disease,neutral,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.science.org/content/article/can-century-old-tb-vaccine-steel-immune-system-against-new-coronavirus," They will test whether a century-old vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial disease, can rev up the human immune system in a broad way, allowing it to better fight the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 and, perhaps, prevent infection with it altogether. The studies will be done in physicians and nurses, who are at higher risk of becoming infected with the respiratory disease than the general population, and in the elderly, who are at higher risk of serious illness if they become infected. A team in the Netherlands will kick off the first of the trials this week. They will recruit 1000 health care workers in eight Dutch hospitals who will either receive the vaccine, called bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or a placebo. BCG contains a live, weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis, a cousin of M. tuberculosis, the microbe that causes TB.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Study to Help Prevent COVID-19





Home
COVID-19











SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a contagious virus affecting everyone. Researchers at Texas A&M University, in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College Medicine and Cedars Sinai Medical Center, are looking for health care workers, first responders, front line workers, seniors and those with preexisting health conditions to participate in a study evaluating the Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a booster of the immune response and to study if this vaccine reduces illness severity from coronavirus. The study will also examine if BGC will improve efficacy of recent vaccines.The goal of this trial is to learn if a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, a nearly 100-year-old commonly used tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, can help prevent COVID-19 infection and/or mitigate the severity of the illness compared to a placebo. Vaccine Trial Eligibility and Consent
To participate, volunteers must be:

At least 18 years old
Personnel working at a hospital, medical center or clinic, including medical, veterinary, dental and ophthalmology; first responders such as law enforcement, firefighters or paramedics; front line workers such as a teachers, wait staff, grocery store workers; or high risk individuals such as the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions
Able to use their own device to provide data electronically (e.g. via smartphone or tablet)
Able to participate for at least six months

If you would like to participate, consent will be collected electronically and by phone in adherence with current physical distancing practices.",help prevent COVID-19 infection,neutral,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/respiratory/tuberculosis-vaccine-bacille-calmette-guerin-covid-19-respiratory-infections-older-adults/," Researchers performed a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04417335) in 2014 adults aged 60 years and older to determine if the BCG vaccine could prevent COVID-19 infection or provide heterologous protection against nontuberculosis infections. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive either intracutaneous vaccination with BCG (n=1008) or placebo (n=1006). The cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infections requiring medical intervention during 12 months of follow-up was the primary endpoint. The incidence of COVID-19 and the vaccine effects on cellular and humoral immune responses were secondary endpoints. The median patient age was 67 (IQR, 64-72) years, 47.5% were women, none of the patients had a medical history of SARS-CoV-2, and 29.2% of patients who received the BCG vaccine vs 25.4% who did not receive the BCG vaccine had a history of BCG vaccination before the study. The cumulative incidence of infections satisfying the primary endpoint definition was 0.029 and 0.024 for the BCG-vaccinated and placebo groups, respectively (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.26; 98.2% CI, 0.65-2.44).",the BCG vaccine could prevent COVID-19 infection,yes,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87731-9," Immunologists have long known about so called adjuvant effects of many bacterial species, including BCG, and have taken broad advantage of this phenomenon to enhance innate immune responses in a variety of settings including inclusion in autologous tumor vaccines35. However, the recent observations that this immune modulating effect can be long lasting, via trained immunity, provides an interesting mechanism that may explain some of the observations described here and may form a basis for potential COVID-19 protection in those individuals vaccinated with BCG, even years ago36. This observation motivates recent studies on the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19. Yet the evidence is not conclusive.Our results reconcile the existing different opinions towards the protection of BCG against COVID-19. We show that the protectiveness of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is strongest during the very early stage of the pandemic, while as the government begins to implement social distancing policy, and other actions, the effect of BCG vaccination gradually disappears in the later stages. Although the old vaccines may protect from the virus, the self-protection actions as well as compliance to social distancing policies are still the most protective measures in absence of an effective COVID-19 vaccine.Our study differs from previous studies in several aspects.",the evidence is not conclusive,neutral,"

Trials and tribulations: challenges conducting the BRACE trial during a pandemic. In this webinar, we heard from Prof Nigel Curtis, the Chief Principal Investigator of the BRACE trial of BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19, about the challenges of running the BRACE trial during a pandemic. The BRACE trial is an international randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of BCG vaccination in reducing incidence and severity of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. The trial has been in progress for over 12 months, and has reached over 6,000 healthcare workers across Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil, Chile, the United States and the United Kingdom.",It is anticipated that the BCG vaccine might therefore reduce viraemia,neutral,"

Can BCG vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e052101," It is possible that HCWs may become less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 as a result of improved preventive practices, reduced community transmission and/or following the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, once COVID-19-specific vaccines become available, interest in participating in the current trial might wane. We have therefore chosen diverse recruitment settings and included secondary outcome measures to evaluate the impact of BCG vaccination on other illnesses and infections (febrile and/or respiratory symptoms, herpes simplex virus reactivation) and on the immune system overall (immunological studies).PerspectiveThis trial is designed to determine whether BCG vaccination can reduce the incidence and/or severity of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also aims to provide data on the ability of BCG vaccination to reduce the overall rate and/or severity of febrile and respiratory illnesses in adults. This is particularly important for viral outbreaks that coincide with the winter influenza season, and could help to reduce the overall strain on the healthcare system. If the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of BCG vaccination is correct, then this vaccine could be implemented as an early intervention to protect HCWs and other high-risk groups in future novel respiratory virus outbreaks.DisseminationThe trial protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327206) and is available in the online supplemental material.",once COVID-19-specific vaccines become available,neutral,"

However, this review presents a different finding from the study done by Ricco et al. early on in the pandemic, which previously concluded that there is no sound evidence to recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19 [38].

Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7287029/," None of the reports about the use of ibuprofen in COVID-19 mention the use or not of paracetamol before or in the early stages of infection, whereas this use is widespread [31–33].These findings raise the following points:An indication bias may exist: more severe cases with more symptoms and higher fever might not respond well to the first-line antipyretic paracetamol, so ibuprofen would then be used (channeling). The same has been described with soft-tissue infection [34]. This may be compounded by a reporting notoriety bias [35], where only cases exposed to ibuprofen are reported.The reality of an increased risk of severe pneumonia in patients chronically on drugs that upregulate ACE-2, such as NSAIDs, ACEIs, or ARBs, has not been shown; in fact, upregulating ACE-2 might also have beneficial effects [20, 21, 25]. Prior use of ACEIs either did not change or reduced the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 [22].In a study of associations between exposure to ACEIs or ARBs and influenza, the risk of influenza was lower with ACEIs or ARBs, and this protection increased with the duration of use [36]. Preexisting diseases that may also be worsened by long-term NSAIDs, such as hypertension or heart failure, seem to increase the risk of mortality in COVID-19 [22, 37, 38].A public health decision based on a few anecdotal reports and irrelevant experimental data may have deprived patients of a drug effective at controlling pain and fever. Encouraging the use of paracetamol while discouraging the use of ibuprofen might induce patients to use higher doses of paracetamol rather than adding ibuprofen for symptom control, increasing the risk of hepatic injury [31, 39–41], which might also be increased by COVID-19-related alterations of liver function [42–44].At this point, there exist no scientific data to support an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity with ibuprofen.",An indication bias may exist,neutral,"

EMA gives advice on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for COVID-19








Press release 18/03/2020










EMA is aware of reports, especially on social media, which raise questions about whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19).There is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19. EMA is monitoring the situation closely and will review any new information that becomes available on this issue in the context of the pandemic.In May 2019, EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) started a review of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines ibuprofen and ketoprofen​​​​​​ following a survey by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) which suggested that infection due to chickenpox (varicella) and some bacterial infections could be made worse by these medicines. The product information of many NSAIDs already contains warnings that their anti-inflammatory effects may hide the symptoms of a worsening infection. The PRAC is reviewing all available data to see if any additional measure is required.When starting treatment for fever or pain in COVID-19, patients and healthcare professionals should consider all available treatment options including paracetamol and NSAIDs. Each medicine has its own benefits and risks which are reflected in its product information and which should be considered along with EU national treatment guidelines, most of which recommend paracetamol as a first treatment option for fever or pain.In line with EU national treatment guidelines, patients and healthcare professionals can continue using NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) as per the approved product information. Current advice includes that these medicines are used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.Patients who have any questions should speak to their doctor or pharmacist.",coronavirus disease,neutral,"

The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that “the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.”
For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are multiple over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. FDA suggests speaking to your health care professional if you are concerned about taking NSAIDs and rely on these medications to treat chronic diseases. FDA advises the public to read the full Drug Facts Label on OTC medications prior to use. OTC medications are safe and effective when you follow the directions on the label and/or as directed by your health care professional.",FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs,neutral,"

Loading... The TGA is aware of anecdotal reports circulating in the media of an association between the use of ibuprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID) and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.We have investigated this safety concern and found that there is currently no published peer-reviewed scientific evidence to support a direct link between use of ibuprofen and more severe infection with COVID-19.We will continue to monitor this issue.Information for consumersIf you are concerned that you may have symptoms of COVID-19, you should seek advice from a health professional about how to manage your symptoms and whether you require testing.As with all medicines, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) can cause side effects (also known as adverse events). The risk of harmful side effects increases if you use a medicine in a way other than as recommended.NSAIDs that are available over-the-counter carry instructions/warnings on their label, including that:they should not be used if you have heart failure or impaired kidney function they should not be used for more than a few days at a time unless advised by a doctor the recommended dose should not be exceeded.If you are currently taking ibuprofen, or another NSAID, for management of a chronic health problem, do not stop taking your medication without discussing this first with your treating doctor.Information for health professionalsWhen considering treatment for pain or fever in patients with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, you should refer to any relevant Australian clinical guidelines and carefully consider the risks and benefits of the available treatment options on a case-by-case basis.If you observe any adverse events that suggest a potential link between the use of ibuprofen, or any other medicine, and worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, please report it to the TGA (see 'Reporting problems' below).Reporting problemsConsumers and health professionals are encouraged to report problems with medicines or vaccines. Your report will contribute to the TGA's monitoring of these products.The TGA cannot give advice about an individual's medical condition. You are strongly encouraged to talk with a health professional if you are concerned about a possible adverse event associated with a medicine or vaccine. Topics

Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1086," Advice to use paracetamol is also less likely to result in complications.”Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, said that ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory properties could “dampen down” the immune system, which could slow the recovery process. He added that it was likely, based on similarities between the new virus (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS I, that covid-19 reduces a key enzyme that part regulates the water and salt concentration in the blood and could contribute to the pneumonia seen in extreme cases. “Ibuprofen aggravates this, while paracetamol does not,” he said.Charlotte Warren-Gash, associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “For covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions. In the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.”Rupert Beale, an infectious diseases researcher at the Francis Crick Institute, had a warning on cortisone, however. “Patients taking cortisone or other steroids should not stop them except on advice from their doctor,” he said.The complex role that the immune system might play in covid-19 disease has been underscored by reports that Swiss drug company Roche has secured approval from China for its anti-inflammation drug Actemra (tocilizumab) to treat patients developing severe complications from covid-19.Some doctors in Italy, including Paolo Ascierto of the Pascale Hospital in Naples, claim that they have had success treating severely ill patients with the drug, which blocks the key inflammatory molecule interleukin-6.There is speculation that the drug might prevent fatal “cytokine storms,” in which the immune system of seriously ill patients can cause organ failure.This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/commission-on-human-medicines-advice-on-ibuprofen-and-coronavirus-covid-19," Patients can take paracetamol or ibuprofen when self-medicating for symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and headache, and should follow NHS advice if they have any questions or if symptoms get worse. Taking ibuprofen
Patients should always read the patient information when taking over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, and follow the instructions on how to take the medicines. Prescribing ibuprofen
Healthcare professionals should consider a patient’s individual risk factors, including any history of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal illness, when prescribing ibuprofen.

PARIS (AFP) — Taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen does not increase the risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 or of dying from it, according to a new study, the largest so far on this class of medicines. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. But observational research published Saturday in the medical journal Lancet Rheumatology, based on 72,000 hospitalized patients, found that the drugs “do not increase the mortality or severity” of COVID-19. The authors recommended that doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs as they have in the past. “When the pandemic began over a year ago, we needed to be sure that these common medications would not lead to worse outcomes in people with COVID-19,” lead author Ewen Harrison, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said in a press release.",Ibuprofen does not worsen COVID-19 symptoms,neutral,"

The outcome assessed was a 30-day composite of severe COVID-19 diagnosis with acute respiratory syndrome, ICU admission, or death. The study found that there was no significant (p = 0.74) association between ibuprofen prescription claims and severe COVID-19; standardized absolute risks of the composite outcome for ibuprofen-prescribed vs. non-ibuprofen patients were 16.3% (95% CI 12.1–20.6) vs. 17.0% (95% CI 16.0–18.1). Similarly, in the Saudi Arabian study of COVID-19 patients reported by Abu Esba et al., acute use of ibuprofen was not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-NSAID users38.Castro et al. used electronic health records to identify commonly prescribed medications that may be associated with a lower risk of morbidity among patients with COVID-1949.

RCPCH publishes new advice on use of ibuprofen and COVID-19


Following recommendations made by experts at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Alder Hey are recommending that parents can treat symptoms of fever or pain related to COVID-19 with either paracetamol or ibuprofen. The Commission on Human Medicines’ Expert Working Group on coronavirus (COVID-19) has concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contracting or worsening of COVID-19. Catrin Barker, Chair of the RCPCH Medicines Committee and Chief Pharmacist at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital said:
“Our advice to parents is that either paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to treat their child if they have symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and headache, and should follow NHS advice if they have any questions or if symptoms get worse. Parents should always read the patient information when taking over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, and follow the instructions on how to take the medicines.”
To manage symptoms of fever:

Keep your child well hydrated – give plenty of fluids to drink. Tepid sponging is not recommended. Children with fever should not be under-dressed or over-wrapped.",symptoms get worse,neutral,"

There is no scientific evidence that establishes a link between ibuprofen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. The Government of Canada is monitoring the situation closely, including reviewing new information and reports as they become available, and will take the appropriate action to help protect the health and safety of Canadians. Some reports have suggested that there are risks of using ibuprofen to treat symptoms of infection. In August 2019, Health Canada initiated a safety review of ibuprofen and the risk of certain serious bacterial infections in children with chicken pox, and has recently concluded there was no link. A summary of this review is expected to be published shortly.",There is no scientific evidence that establishes a link between ibuprofen,neutral,"

        Abstract
        
      


      
      This report provides a perspective on the relevance of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation to the COVID-19 crisis. While there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role against SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous work on their utility against influenza and recent post-hoc analysis of the Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions. We attempt to derive novel insights into their usefulness, both from theoretical and practical standpoints.",there is limited evidence concerning their curative or preventive role,neutral,"

Terra Forward, chief of Fort Leonard Wood’s Department of Public Health. “While gargling salt water may sooth a sore throat, it won’t work to stop infection with COVID-19 or any other virus,” she said. “Interestingly, this myth was spread on social media as a cure for SARS, MERS, and Zika as well, but there is no evidence that gargling warm water with salt or a vinegar solution prevents any viral infection.”
Whether spread intentionally or not, COVID-19 misinformation is harmful to individual and public health, Forward said. Knowing where to find accurate information is important as the way people get information continues to change.

It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus. One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus. The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease. While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.",there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,neutral,"

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and BREATHE, the Health Data Research Hub for respiratory health, are seeking volunteers across the UK to take part in a clinical trial testing whether gargling and nasal washing with salt water can reduce the early symptoms and progression of COVID-19. Nasal washing and gargling with salt water has been used as a cold remedy for centuries in India, where it’s known as jala neti or nasyam. It was also used in the West as a preventive measure against the flu and other respiratory infections in the early 20th century but fell out of favour. The group recently identified the mechanism used by epithelial cells (such as those lining the nose and throat) to fight viral infections. These cells make use of chloride ions to fight viral infections, and supplying the chloride ion through salt, helps the cells clear the infection. Previous research has shown that nasal washing and gargling with salt water (a way to supply the cells with the chloride ion) can reduce the duration of the common cold by an average of 1.9 days, along with reduction in viral shedding and transmission within households.",reduce the early symptoms and progression of COVID-19,neutral,"

Thus, it is easy to dislodge the virus through gargling and nasal irrigation by salt water. However, in severe cases of Covid-19, where the virus has invaded the lower respiratory tract or lungs, gargling does not help.A research study by teams from Dr Reddy’s Institute of Life Sciences, HCU campus, Hyderabad, Malla Reddy Medical College for Women, Hyderabad, and MNR Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, reveals that this simple technique is beneficial for people, who are in home quarantine, or who cannot visit a physician. According to them, while there is limited clinical evidence on the curative or preventive role of saline water gargling and nasal irrigation, research studies provide compelling support to their applicability in the current crisis. The result of the study was published in the recent issue of scientific journal, Explore.They said a recent post-hoc analysis of Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS) gives a ""compelling support to the applicability of gargling and nasal irrigation. This method is simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategy with therapeutic and prophylactic value"".According to the researchers, the common salt (sodium chloride) present in saline water inhibits replication of a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus.",gargling does not help,no,"

"
Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://www.biospace.com/article/salt-water-vs-covid-19-scottish-researchers-launch-study-to-lessen-symptoms-and-duration-of-illness/," The just-announced study aims to prove that. Other European researchers, reporting in Rhinology Online, speculate that copper-enhanced nasal saline irrigations confer protection against COVID-19. Based upon a study that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in which copper eliminated all viable SARS-CoV-2 virus on its surface within four hours, the authors suggest that copper-infused sale solution may “decrease the potential risk of viral infection by both a mechanical and biological effect.” No studies assessing the effects of copper on COVID-19 have been listed yet on ClinicalTrials.gov. Salt water will not cure COVID-19, nor remove the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the body, but salt water gargle or using it to irrigate nasal passages can help reduce symptoms. It works by drawing fluid from inflamed tissues, thereby reducing swelling. It also helps break up mucus, and thus can remove bacteria, fungi and other irritants from the throat.",Salt water will not cure COVID-19,no,"

Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://www.techarp.com/science/german-salt-water-gargle-covid-19/," Neither do German scientists and experts advocate the use of salt water gargle against COVID-19. Fact #3 : Gargling Cannot Prevent COVID-19
Gargling cannot prevent COVID-19, because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted through three principle ways :

inhalation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles,
deposition of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles on exposed mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eye, and
touching mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eye, with contaminated hands

Gargling cannot prevent infection when you breathe in the coronavirus, or if infectious droplets fall onto your eyes. Neither can gargling prevent infection when you accidentally touch your mouth, nose or eye with contaminated hands. Fact #4 : COVID-19 Does Not Germinate In Your Throat
The fake news suggests that COVID-19 germinates for a week in your throat. The SARS-CoV-2 virus will not “chill out” and multiply in your throat for a week, before heading to your lungs.",Gargling cannot,no,"

"
Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://pajhwok.com/2022/02/27/saline-efficiency-in-treating-covid-not-yet-proven-experts/," A number of other citizens recommend gargling with salt water to prevent coronavirus and even cure the disease, and recommend it to other patients as well. Doctors: Salt water gargling cannot completely kill the coronavirus
Dr. Mairani Bratzai, in charge of infection prevention and control (IPC) at the Afghan Japan Hospital, told Pajhwok that the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet commented on the use of saltwater for treatment of the virus. He said gargling salt water was useful for cleaning the throat and preventing the spread of too much infection in the throat, but its usefulness for Covid had not yet been proven and therefore its effectiveness for Covid cannot be confirmed. He urged families and patients with Covid to refrain from using foods and medicines that had not been proven effective. He called on people to go to health centers for better treatment and to be guided by a doctor. Meanwhile, the Iranian American journal of medicine-health has published an article titled: “A few mistakes in preventing the coronariuv that gargling with salt water does not work for Covid-19.”

The article said that nasal salt spray and gargling with salt water for coronavirus, although this medoth is effective against cold but garglind with salt water does not work for Covid-19.",its effectiveness for Covid cannot be confirmed,neutral,"

Can gargling salt water prevent COVID-19?,https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/german-scientists-have-not-said-gargle-with-warm-alkaline-water-will-kill-covid-19," Please support this special project, so we can continue to tell stories that matter. Thank you – Team WebQoof)A long text message that has gone viral on the internet claims that German scientists have found that we can stop the novel coronavirus from reaching our lungs by ""gargling with a semi-hot solution of salt and water"" several times a day. The claim goes on to say that by following this practice, an alkaline environment would be created in the mouths, which would prevent the COVID-19 virus from multiplying. However, we found that the claims made in the viral post were false. We didn't find any such recommendations made by German scientists. Additionally, claims like gargling with hot water kills COVID-19 and that the virus is sensitive to changing pH had gone viral at the beginning of the pandemic and have resurfaced amid rising cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant.ADVERTISEMENTCLAIMThe viral claim starts by saying, ""German scientists announced, after a series of studies, that the Coronavirus not only reproduces in the lungs like the SARS virus in 2002, but also spreads widely in the throat during the first week of infection.",we can stop the novel coronavirus from reaching our lungs,neutral,"

A graphic has been shared thousands of times on Facebook which claims that gargling warm water with salt or vinegar can eliminate the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The claim is false; international health authorities and experts do not list gargling as an effective remedy or prevention method for COVID-19. The claim was published in this Facebook post on March 14, 2020.

But SWGs may be helpful for common mouth and throat concerns like allergies, canker sores, and sore throat. While gargling won’t necessarily prevent illnesses, it can provide relief from bothersome symptoms.Gargling with salt water has been practiced for generations by people around the globe.

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8492833/," The proportion of patients’ hospitalization for COVID 19 treatment was also lower among ginger users (28.0%) than in nonusers (38.0%).46 In a study from Bangladesh, a few cases of cured COVID-19 patients were described who consumed home medicines containing ginger in mixes of various herbs with or without the use of additional treatments.47 According to the results from a Tunisian study, treatment of a few cases of COVID-19 with home medicines containing ginger in combinations with other herbs reduced disease symptoms.48 In some parts of Africa, acclaimed remedies containing ginger in mixes of various herbs were also used for the management of COVID-19.49 The results from a clinical trial study from Iran indicate that a combination therapy by ginger and Echinacea in suspected COVID-19 outpatients attenuated some of their clinical symptoms (breath shortness, coughing and muscular pain) in comparison with those treated with a standard protocol using hydroxychloroquine, alone.50 In addition, the hospitalization rate in the intervention group (2.0%) was lower than that in the control group (6.0%).50 The results from a randomized-controlled study showed that the patients with ARDS who were fed an enteral diet enriched with ginger extract for 21 days exhibited greater oxygenation, lower serum concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, and spent shorter time on mechanical ventilation compared to control group. However, organ failure, barotrauma and mortality rate similarly occurred in ginger-treated patients and control group.20 Ginger can have beneficial impacts in patients suffering from pulmonary complications such as ARDS, lung fibrosis, and pneumonia, as well as sepsis, all of which are signs observed in COVID-19.51 Overall, the aforesaid evidence indicates that more high-quality controlled trials need to confirm the effectiveness and safety of ginger or its compound in COVID-19 patients. A clinical trial is going on in Iran, in which a total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were randomly classified into two groups of each with 42 participants, including intervention and control groups. The intervention group will be administrated standard treatment protocol plus 1000 mg ginger three times daily for seven days, whereas the control group will be received standard treatment plus placebo tablets at the same dose and timing.52
Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidative potentials of gingerGinger potentials to modulate the neutrophil responsesThe neutrophils from COVID-19 display an activation status. Neutrophil activation and degranulation can promote inflammation and hemorrhagic lesions in the pulmonary system of COVID-19 patients.53 Lymphopenia and a higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio also happen in patients with severe COVID-19.54 Patients with COVID-19 exhibited high circulating levels of calprotectin (a neutrophil activation marker) and its quantities were higher in patients who had progressed to the severe form of the disease.55 During viral respiratory infections, the quantities of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 8, which is a neutrophil-recruitment chemokine, in the secretions of airways were positively related to the count of neutrophils, amount of neutrophil-derived elastase, and clinical scores.56
,
57 Activated neutrophils displayed NETosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation leading to lung injury, which promotes ARDS.56 The interaction of viral proteins with TLR4 triggers NETosis which consists of large extracellular, web-like structures.56
,
58
In an experimental inflammatory model, ginger aqueous extract dose-dependently attenuates the neutrophil infiltration and activation that assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) production.59 Ginger aqueous extract also reduces leukocyte infiltration in an animal model of allergic asthma.60 GEO potently suppresses the ROS production by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated human neutrophils.61 In a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI), pretreatment with zingerone decreases lung histopathologic alterations, alveolar hemorrhage as well as neutrophil accumulation and MPO activity.21 Ginger extract inhibits the CXCL8 production by fibroblast-like synovial cells collected from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis.62
Ginger potentials to modulates the macrophage responsesSARS-CoV-infected human macrophages express C–C chemokine ligand (CCL2), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, MIP1α), CCL8 (MCP2), CCL7 (MCP3), and CXCL10.63
,
64 Treatment of the human monocytes with the purified S protein of SARS-CoV promotes CCL15, CCL16, CCL19, CXCL10, and CXCL11 expression.65
,
66 Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected human macrophages express CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, interleukin (IL-2), and IL-3.67 SARS-CoV-2 can infect several monocyte and macrophage subsets via ACE2-related and/or ACE2-unrelated paths.68 SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes/macrophages secrete great concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators causing local organ inflammation and cytokine storms. Raised quantities of IFN-γ, TNF-α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL8, CXCL10, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP1, MIP1A, and MIP1B were observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in those who required ICU services.69 Both localized organ inflammation and cytokine storm have critical roles in the exacerbation of SARS-CoV-2-related consequences.68
Elevated amounts of neutrophil-recruitment chemokines (including CCL7 and CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL2) and monocyte/lymphocyte-recruitment chemokines (such as CCL20, CCL8, CCL7, CCL4, CCL3, CCL2 as well CXCL11 and CXCL6) were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens collected from COVID-19 patients.9 Chemokines recruit leukocytes into the lungs, thus performing an essential role in the occurrence of pulmonary abnormalities.9 Patients suffering from severe and moderate COVID-19 display greater frequencies of M1-like macrophages in BALF and greater CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 quantities in circulation than healthy individuals.70
Two major subsets of macrophages, including M1-and M2 macrophages generate large amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12, nitric oxide (NO), and ROS) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-10, TGF-β and IL-1 receptor antagonist), respectively.13
,
71 Greater proportions of FCN1+- and FCN1lo SPP1+ macrophages (M1-like type) were detected in the BALF samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19, while BALF specimens that collected from patients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals had greater numbers of FABP4+ macrophages (M2-like type).70 In animal models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the differentiation of lung macrophage to an M1-like phenotype limits the virus replication.72 The sharp depletion of M1-like macrophages occurs during SARS and influenza A infections, which supports the viral expansion.72 The improper activation of M2 macrophages leads to lung fibrosis, while hyper-activation of M1 macrophages exacerbates harmful inflammatory responses.73
,
74 However, mitigation of the RSV-linked immunopathologic consequences needs a balanced induction of the M1-and M2-like macrophages.72

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-022-00717-w," Specifically, ginger exhibited a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome [10, 11], the primary cause of mortality in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, bioactive compounds present in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, showed high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus could potentially interfere with the spike protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) interaction [12, 13]. Interactions between ginger-derived compounds and papain-like protease and other virus proteins essential for its survival were also indicated via computational theoretical models [14, 15].Taken together, ginger presents the potential as an alternative therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial to examine the effect of the ginger supplement on the clinical manifestations of individuals with COVID-19.MethodsStudy design and participantsThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, and the trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059824).

Heath experts: ginger’s efficiency has no scientific basis. Dr. Hashmatullah Faizi, a senior official of the Afghan-Japan Covid-19 Hospital in Kabul, told Pajhwok: “Ginger is a herbal that we recommend to patients after the outbreak of the virus.”
He said ginger had anti-inflammatory nature and boost the immunity and effective in treatment of Covid. But he said that the efficiency of the ginger was yet to be proven against Covid-19. Dr. Mohammad Hashim Wahaj, director of Wahaj private hospital, told Pajhwok no research had so far been done over the effectiveness of ginger against Covid. “Although ginger is a nutritious food and is used both as flavoring and medicine, researchers in the world have warned that some people should be careful in its consumption it may have side effects and even dangerous consequences.”

Rapid Response:
The role of ginger plants against COVID-19






Dear Editor
Thank you to the authors for this thought-provoking editorial [1]. Zimmermann et al (2022) reveal long COVID-19 in children and adolescents, symptoms involving almost every organ system after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concern has focused more on the potential long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, I believe that functional foods, especially Gingerae, play a role in fighting COVID-19. Western medicine solves the issue of human organs, and traditional Chinese medicine solves the issue of human body system; however, functional food is to address the problem of human cells[2]. The 12 key functional components of barley grains and its grass not only play an important role in the prevention and treatment of more than 20 chronic human diseases but also interact with 30 other nutritional functional components to provide the possibility to solve hundreds of human diseases caused by cell undernutrition and their detoxification disorders [2].",functional foods,neutral,"

Can Ginger cure COVID-19?,https://health-desk.org/articles/are-any-foods-or-drinks-alone-or-in-combination-effective-in-treating-or-curing-covid-19," Health experts from the World Health Organization have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that ginger will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Honey: Honey may have some wound healing and antibacterial properties, but much of the published research focuses on topical (skin) application, which doesn’t apply to COVID-19 because the virus is an internal infection. While it can be part of a healthy diet, honey is a source of sugar, and leading health organizations recommend limiting dietary sugar intake. Health experts from the World Health Organization have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is also no scientific evidence that honey can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.",There is no scientific evidence,neutral,"

About Ginger Powder Theory:According to The National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine, ginger cannot prevent or cure Covid-19. In the report, it mentions that drinking ginger tea or ginger powder, ginger capsules will not prevent or fight against Covid-19. There is some evidence that ginger can cure nausea, but combining ginger or taking ginger separately will not cure Covid-19. It further adds, viral infections spread in our body when the virus enters our cells and makes copies of itself and then those copies enter new cells and repeat the process. Ginger will not destroy the virus in our body or stop the copying process.",ginger cannot prevent or cure Covid-19,no,"

""I think we have to be careful with what we would consider to be the traditional remedies that people use for making themselves feel better,"" said Ryan during a press briefing from Geneva on Wednesday.He added: ""During a common cold or the flu or any illness… some of us like to take a drink with honey, some like to take ginger, some of us take special herbal teas. ""Anything that makes one feel better, anything that provides that reassurance and anything that you believe can help your health that's not dangerous certainly has a positive impact on your health, but it's a different thing to say that something is effective in treating the disease,"" he added.

It is widely known that mixture (Pepper powder + Honey + Ginger juice) is a good remedy for cold, cough, and to boost immunity. Those reports can be seen here, here, and here. But none of these reports claimed it as the remedy to cure COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) had debunked several similar myths that are being spread around COVID-19.Earlier, when similar home remedies for COVID-19 went viral on social media, FACTLY published fact-check articles debunking those claims.

(Ideally, you would have your level checked and keep the blood level between 50-80 ng/mL).N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC): 600- 800 mg twice a day.

Can 5G antennas cause COVID-19?,https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2021/5g-doesnt-cause-covid-19-but-myth-went-viral/," He also noted that “regulators have set limits on the radiation power of 5G devices, though additional safety studies may still be warranted.”
And, such radiation can’t cause COVID-19. COVID-19 is a viral disease that comes from the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of similar myths in the future, experts need to consistently and clearly correct common misconceptions. And better transparency from both government bodies and researchers could prevent misinformation from ever taking root. “We [researchers] need to humanize the conversations around misinformation and continue to share true information so that misinformation becomes less prevalent in the media,” said Nsoesie.

Can 5G antennas cause COVID-19?,https://radio-waves.orange.com/en/news/is-there-a-connection-between-coronavirus-and-5g/," There is no connection between 5G and COVID-19. The Coronavirus is a virus that is spread from one person to another through droplets that people sneeze, cough or exhale. 5G is the new generation of mobile network technology that is transmitted over non-ionising radio waves. There is no evidence that 5G is harmful to people’s health. The outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan is unrelated to 5G, and is thought to have originated in a seafood wholesale market.” The Science Media CentreThe Science Media Centre in Great Britain cites experts saying that the theories connecting 5G to COVID-19 demonstrate a “complete lack of understanding of the difference between cause and coincidence”.Prof Malcolm Sperrin, Director of the Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, said:“…The supposed correlation between 5G and its development in China reveals a complete lack of understanding of the difference between cause and coincidence. In the simplest terms there might have been a train leaving Wuhan station during 5G development, but the train departure was not caused by 5G.”Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, said:“The idea that COVID19 is caused by 5G mobile phone signals is complete rubbish.",There is no connection,no,"

PODGORICA, 11 JULY 2021 – Almost one-third of the citizens of Montenegro (31%) believe that 5G technology causes or spreads coronavirus and that this is being kept secret so that the companies dealing with this technology can continue to make a significant profit. This is one of the findings from a March survey on a nationally representative sample conducted by the research agency Ipsos, with the support of the British Embassy in Podgorica and UNICEF. UNICEF's Young Reporters analysed this conspiracy theory in Montenegro to check if there was any truth in it. Their analysis is available on UNICEF Montenegro's website and it shows that the fifth generation of mobile internet does not kill the living world or spread coronavirus. Younger citizens aged 18–44 years, as well as citizens with higher education, believe this conspiracy theory less often.",5G technology does not cause or spread coronavirus,no,"

We have asked our experts to provide some facts about these presumed links.Fact 1. There is no link between 5G and coronavirus.Many noticed that Wuhan was very advanced on 5G rollout, and suspected a possible link with the outbreak of coronavirus in that region. But coronavirus has spread also in many countries that do not have 5G installations. Claims that the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan due to China’s 5G network are unfounded and dangerous. That is why the EU institutions, countries, and many online platforms are actively identifying and fighting the spread of conspiracy theory content that links the coronavirus to 5G networks.",burning down,no,"

Let’s be clear here. Your money is not sending you secret messages about 5G and the COVID-19 coronavirus. There is no scientific evidence that 5G towers are causing COVID-19 symptoms or that 5G radiation is making people more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infections.

One is that 5G weakens immune systems, another that it inhibits oxygen intake, exacerbating the disease, a third that covid-19 does not exist but is a cover for 5G-related diseases that governments are trying to hush up. Amanda Holden, a TV personality, tweeted a (now-deleted) petition linking 5G with coronavirus. On April 7th, YouTube removed an interview with David Icke, a conspiracy theorist, repeating the story, and said it would ban all such content.The theories have spread like wildfire in Africa, America and Europe, says Hanna Linderstal of Earhart, a security and risk-management firm, with Europeans the most enthusiastic proponents.

Can 5G antennas cause COVID-19?,https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/stop-global-roll-out-of-5g-networks-until-safety-is-confirmed-urges-expert/," There are no health concerns about 5G and COVID-19, despite what conspiracy theorists have suggested. But the transmitter density required for 5G means that more people will be exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs), and at levels that emerging evidence suggests, are potentially harmful to health, argues Professor John William Frank, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh. The advent of 5G technology has been hailed by governments and certain vested interests as transformative, promising clear economic and lifestyle benefits, through massively boosting wireless and mobile connectivity at home, work, school and in the community, he says. But it has become the subject of fierce controversy, fuelled by four key areas of scientific uncertainty and concern. The lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; and a growing but far from comprehensive body of laboratory research indicating the biologically disruptive potential of RF-EMFs  
An almost total lack (as yet) of high quality epidemiological studies of the impact on human health from 5G EMF exposure
Mounting epidemiological evidence of such effects from previous generations of RF-EMF exposure at lower levels
Persistent allegations that some national telecomms regulatory authorities haven’t based their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, amid potential conflicts of interest

5G uses much higher frequency (3 to 300GHz) radio waves than in the past and it makes use of very new—and relatively unevaluated, in terms of safety—supportive technology to enable this higher data transmission capacity, points out Professor Frank. Its inherent fragility means that transmission boosting ‘cell’ antennae are generally required every 100–300 m—which is far more spatially dense than the transmission masts required for older 2G, 3G and 4G technology, using lower frequency waves, he says.",There are no health concerns,no,"

The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty. One prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on.Direct action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new. When 3G equipment was being installed across the country in the mid-2000s there was similar outbreaks of concern about supposed health risks, with some resorting to direct action.",could lead to physical harm,neutral,"

Therefore, we urgently need to explore new strategies to treat COVID-19. Tea is popular all over the world as a food drink; in fact, tea has been used as an herbal medicine to prevent and treat various diseases (9). Tea and its characteristic polyphenols—catechins—have been shown to be active in preventing obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases (10–12). Tea ingredients have also been shown to have anti-viral activity as well as protective activity against diseases caused by oxidative stress and inflammation; many of these ingredients may help alleviate and treat COVID-19 (13, 14).

Can herbal tea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/green-tea-and-covid," Originating from China, green tea is lauded for many health benefits due to its potential antioxidant, antiviral and immune-boosting properties (1, 2).It’s recently been investigated for a possible role in managing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes illness from COVID-19. You may have heard that drinking green tea prevents or cures the disease.In this article, we explain whether green tea affects COVID-19 and offer some immune-boosting tips.Share on PinterestDylan Leeder/Stocksy UnitedDoes green tea prevent or cure COVID-19?Green tea is rich in health-promoting polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has anti-viral effects against single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses like Zika, hepatitis C, influenza (flu), dengue, and others (1, 3, 4, 5).Like these, the SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA virus. Thus, green tea extracts continue to be investigated for their potential role in treating the virus and managing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2).Test-tube research shows that green tea extracts may combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus by damaging the spike protein, preventing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall volume of the virus (3, 4, 5, 6).Treatment of the test tube cells with EGCG was most effective during early stages of infection (3).However, it’s important to understand that drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. Most studies showing an effect used single green tea extracts like EGCG in concentrated amounts much higher than what’s found in the natural tea.Furthermore, EGCG is poorly absorbed when consumed orally from teas (4).Nonetheless, green tea extracts may have potential to be used for natural treatment of COVID-19 after further human research and testing.Remember, the best way to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 is by getting vaccinated, maintaining physical distancing, and washing your hands often. You can learn more about COVID-19 vaccines here.SummaryDrinking green tea cannot prevent, treat, or cure the COVID-19 virus, but concentrated extracts like EGCG may have potential to be used for natural treatment after further human research and testing.Are there benefits to drinking green tea if you have COVID-19?A COVID-19 infection can cause inflammation, which is linked to symptoms like fatigue, muscle pain, and achy joints (7).Green tea may have anti-inflammatory properties.

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is aware of reports of herbal products, including traditional Chinese medicines, being used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients overseas. There is currently insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of any herbal product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. HSA requires any product that claims to treat infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, to be supported by scientific evidence from controlled clinical studies to substantiate that such a product is safe and effective for such a purpose. Any product that makes claims in relation to COVID-19 must first be submitted to HSA to assess the scientific evidence and be registered before it can be supplied locally. At this time, all herbal products formulated for common cold and flu, including traditional Chinese medicines, should only be used to manage symptoms such as headache, runny or blocked nose, sore throat and cough. Consumers should take note of the following:

To date, HSA has not approved any herbal product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19
Do not purchase any herbal products that make such claims, whether they are from local or overseas sources
Products with unsubstantiated claims can cause serious harm to your health
Seek medical attention promptly if you feel unwell

Dealers and sellers are reminded not to make any false or misleading claims that the products they are selling can prevent, protect against or treat diseases such as COVID-19.",insufficient scientific evidence,neutral,"

It is commonly used to “boost immunity” when people are sick. To date, there are no studies that evaluate Khaada as a therapy for COVID-19, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that Khaada will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate): Baking soda, which often used to help baked goods rise, has also been mixed into drinks by people seeking health benefits.

Over the Counter: Take tea time seriously during COVID-19 pandemicGary Kracoff and John Walczyk
 |  Daily News CorrespondentsAn estimated 159 million Americans regularly drink tea, and according to the Tea Association, in 2020 we downed more than 3.8 billion gallons of it – primarily iced and black. While that may sound like a lot, when averaged over our population, we lag behind many countries including Turkey, the United Kingdom and China.Part of the reason some cultures around the globe have consumed tea for nearly five millennia has been to take advantage of its health benefits. Fast forward to 2021 and tea’s ability to support our immune system amid the COVID-19 pandemic is as important as ever.Traditional teas like black, green and oolong are full of polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), naturally occurring organic compounds that have a potent antioxidant effect on our bodies and therefore may reduce chances of heart disease and cancer. EGCG and the amino acid L-theanine both pack an immune-boosting punch. To get the most antioxidant bang for your buck, avoid adding milk or cream because their proteins may inhibit some polyphenols.Depending on variety, the amount of time and the temperature in which tea leaves are steeped will impact antioxidant levels. White tea should be steeped longer in hot water while black tea is best steeped for a short amount of time in very hot water.",tea’s ability to support our immune system,neutral,"

Can herbal tea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388710v3," Aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae perilla and sage elicit potent and sustained antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. The herbal infusions exerted antiviral effects comparable to interferon-β and remdesivir but outperformed convalescent sera and interferon-α2 upon short-term treatment early after infection. Based on protein fractionation analyses, we identified caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde, and perillyl alcohol as antiviral compounds. Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses performed comparatively in two different cell culture infection models revealed changes of the proteome upon treatment with herbal infusions and provided insights into the mode of action. As inferred by the MS data, induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was confirmed as effector mechanism by the antiviral activity of the HMOX-1-inducing compounds sulforaphane and fraxetin. In conclusion, herbal teas based on perilla and sage exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.Competing Interest StatementDeclaration of interest

A test-tube study found that green tea extracts may fight off COVID-19 infections by damaging the spike protein, curbing its entry into human cells and reducing the overall presence of the virus. But there is no conclusive study that suggests drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19. However, concentrated extracts like EGCG can be used as a natural home remedy to treat COVID-19. readmore05/6What has research foundA 2021 study published in the journal 'RSC Advances' found that gallocatechin - a compound found in green tea - may help in the development of a drug that can combat SARS-CoV-2. The research conducted by Dr Suresh Mohankumar, an academician at Swansea University told ANI, ""Nature's oldest pharmacy has always been a treasure of potential novel drugs and we questioned if any of these compounds could assist us in battling the Covid-19 pandemic?",drinking green tea itself can’t prevent or cure COVID-19,neutral,"

Image source, ReutersImage caption, The army has been brought in to distribute medical suppliesCovid is mainly caught by inhaling tiny droplets in the air via the nose as well as the mouth, so gargling attacks only one point of entry. And once the virus has entered, it replicates and spreads deep into the organs, where no amount of gargling can reach.Painkillers and antibioticsState television has advised patients to use painkillers such as ibuprofen as well as amoxicillin and other antibiotics.Ibuprofen (and paracetamol) can bring down a temperature and ease symptoms such as headache or sore throat but they won't clear the virus or prevent it developing. Antibiotics, meant for bacterial infections not viruses, are not recommended - and risks developing resistant bugs. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Painkillers can help with symptoms - but will not stop the virusLaboratory research suggests some may slow the spread of some viruses, including Covid but these have not been replicated in the real world.A study of the antibiotic azithromycin found it made little or no difference to Covid symptoms, the likelihood of hospital admission or death.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2790074," On February 8, 2022, IDSA strongly recommended against using convalescent plasma in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Among ambulatory patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high risk of progression to more serious symptoms and have no other treatment options, infusing high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset is better than not infusing it, according to the guideline, which described this as a conditional recommendation with low certainty of evidence. The FDA’s most recent revision of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, published December 28, 2021, limits treatment with high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients who have immunosuppressive disease or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies show that convalescent plasma is unlikely to be associated with clinical benefit in immunocompetent individuals with COVID-19, according to the FDA. Interestingly, the WHO recommends against its use for patients who aren’t severely ill, calling the evidence for that position “certain.” Convalescent plasma should be used only within clinical trials for severe and critical patients with COVID-19, the WHO said in December 2021. In a letter to the BMJ, Casadevall and coauthors urged the WHO to reconsider, saying that the organization “avoided digging below the surface to ask critical questions about treatment timing, study populations, and antibody titre” of the convalescent plasma in the trials it considered.",infusing high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma,neutral,"

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19















WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/who-advises-against-use-of-convalescent-plasma-for-covid-19/," The strong recommendation for patients with non-severe illness reflects the panel’s view that drug treatment in patients with a low risk of mortality and other important clinical outcomes is not justified. And although convalescent plasma should not be used routinely in any patients, regardless of how severely ill they are, the panel acknowledged that there was sufficient uncertainty in patients with severe and critical illness to warrant continuation of RCTs. They also noted several practical challenges, such as the need to identify and test potential donors, as well as collect, store and administer donor plasma, which they say further limits its feasibility and applicability. After thoroughly reviewing all the information, the panel judged that almost all well informed patients would choose not to receive convalescent plasma. Today’s guidance adds to previous recommendations for the use of interleukin-6 receptor blockers and systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe or critical covid-19; conditional recommendations for the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies in selected patients and against the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 regardless of disease severity.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-applications-inds-cber-regulated-products/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma," Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral,"

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

AbstractThe efficacy of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset (NCT04348656). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility.",unclear,neutral,"

Particularly before monoclonal antibodies were available, multiple studies focused on the use of CCP to deliver antibodies to patients with COVID-19 without unexpected or serious adverse events. Many of the early studies were observational and nonrandomized in patients with severe or critical disease, complicated by the evolution of additional treatment interventions over time, such as steroids, antivirals, and other drugs; by patient heterogeneity; and by a lack of detailed analyses of neutralizing antibody content of infused units. More than 90,000 patients were enrolled in an FDA-sponsored expanded access program coordinated by Mayo Clinic. In addition, an EUA was issued by the FDA allowing CCP administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside clinical trials. While many patients improved clinically, the specific role of CCP was unclear, given treatment with other therapies including antivirals and/or corticosteroids.",prevention or treatment of COVID-19 disease,neutral,"

Transfusions of blood plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 may help patients hospitalized with the virus, a new international study shows. The treatment, known as convalescent plasma, is still considered experimental by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plasma contains antibodies, blood proteins that are part of the immune system. Shaped so they can attach to the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibodies glom onto and tag it for removal from the body, researchers say.","January 25, 2022",no,"

"
Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://health.ec.europa.eu/blood-tissues-cells-and-organs/covid-19-convalescent-plasma-transfusion_en," For COVID-19, this approach is supported by early scientific evidence and a study conducted in Hong Kong during the SARS-1 crisis (a closely related virus). This empirical evidence also indicates that associated risks are very low. In fact, the procedure is a standard plasma transfusion, where the plasma meets all criteria for safety.In addition to direct transfusion, convalescent plasma can also be used as the starting material for later industrial manufacturing of specific immuno-globulins (medicinal products). The development of such industrially manufactured product would be enhanced by the availability of a substantial inventory of donated convalescent plasma, meeting high standards of quality and safety.Widely available in a short timeConvalescent plasma transfusions can be made available in the short term through the existing organisational capacities in the public/NGO blood services in the EU Member States. In more than half of EU Member States, blood services are preparing for collection. In some EU Member States the collection and supply has already started .",meeting high standards of quality and safety,neutral,"

In past trials, convalescent plasma was found to be ineffective in treating patients with COVID-19. Why are we participating in another trial?While past studies we contributed convalescent plasma to, and others internationally, did not demonstrate sufficient benefit for the patients enrolled, the results did show COVID-19 convalescent plasma contains antibodies of different types, amounts and functions and that these antibodies can vary significantly from one donor to another. Therefore, there may be potential benefit from plasma with more antibodies compared to plasma with fewer antibodies. The timing of how quickly and frequently convalescent plasma is administered may also be a factor, as some studies have shown repeated transfusions earlier in patient care could lead to improved effects. And data from one of the studies we supported (REMAP-CAP) suggested that patients who were immunocompromised may benefit from convalescent plasma.",there may be potential benefit from plasma with more antibodies,neutral,"

We looked at:• deaths from any cause after treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin;• improvement or worsening of patients’ condition, measured by the number of people who needed help from a ventilator (a machine that helps people breathe if they cannot breathe on their own);• quality of life; and• unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin to treat people with COVID-19. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and include participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19.Where possible we pooled the studies’ results to analyse them.

After evaluating safety and efficacy data for patients transfused in the Mayo Clinic-led EAP program and other existing data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to further expand access to convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. This EUA allows the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to be distributed and used by licensed health care providers to treat adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. For more information, refer to the FDA's Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers, which details the process and treatment with convalescent plasma. Related news

Using plasma of patients convalesced from COVID-19, whose blood contains antibodies against the disease-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been touted as a promising treatment for some patients with signs of infection. UMass Chan Medical School’s Jonathan M. Gerber, MD, the Eleanor Eustis Farrington Chair in Cancer Research, professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and medical director of the UMass Cancer Center, was the first in Massachusetts to successfully treat a seriously ill COVID-19 patient with convalescent plasma, in April 2020. He co-authored a recent report on a multicenter clinical trial from Johns Hopkins Medicine, posted on the preprint website MedRxiv, which found convalescent plasma is effective as an early treatment. Dr. Gerber explained convalescent plasma and what researchers have learned in the past two years about its use in treating COVID-19. The interview has been edited for clarity. What is convalescent plasma and how does it work?Jonathan Gerber: Convalescent plasma is plasma directly collected from the blood of somebody who has recovered from an infection, in this case, COVID-19, and it should be chock-full of antibodies against COVID.",it should be chock-full of antibodies against COVID,neutral,"

In this review, the authors have presented positive reports of pneumococcal immunization in COVID-19 individuals with underlying medical problems. Despite the fact that the WHO has stated that bacterial vaccination does not protect against COVID-19 pneumonia, the authors have demonstrated that there is a correlation between pneumococcal disease and COVID-19 in terms of preventing increased morbidity and mortality from secondary infections and superinfections. The authors discussed why pneumococcal vaccination is important in the current pandemic context to improve the global health system in the fight against COVID-19.

Additionally, having the flu shot also led to lower odds of having severe disease (aOR=0.672, 95% CI [0.500, 0.903], p=0.008) and a similar effect was seen with those who had the pneumococcal vaccine (aOR=0.412, 95% CI [0.234, 0.725], p=0.002).The researchers concluded that both the seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine could provide a protective value against symptomatic COVID-19 disease. They urged further study to understand how the influenza and COVID-19 can impact a virus’s epidemiology.Reference1.

Can pneumococcal vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/health-research/news/pneumonia-vaccine-may-affect-course-of-covid-19," While typically harmless, this bacterium is well known for causing pneumonia and other diseases, often in interaction with viruses. This new Kaiser Permanente study provides evidence that these bacterial-viral interactions may play out in ways that shape the course of COVID-19. While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing COVID-19, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine. In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease but does not block acquisition of the bacterium, was not associated with protection. This study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1 to July 22, 2020. Among that population, 3,677 had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 1,075 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 334 died from COVID-19.",While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy,neutral,"

Can pneumococcal vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/can-the-pneumonia-vaccine-protect-against-covid-19/," One is that the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases have bacterial co-infections so that vaccination against pneumococci and Hib prevent these super-infections and the pneumonias they cause. Alternatively, pneumococcal vaccines may protect against COVID-19 is by indirectly vaccinating against SARS-CoV-2 itself. In a second paper, published in Vaccines, I report that pneumococcal vaccines contain bacterial cell wall proteins that mimic SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Antibodies produced against these pneumococcal proteins might, therefore, also protect against the coronavirus.

How pneumococcal vaccination protects against COVID-19
Protection against serious COVID-19 disease by pneumococcal and Hib vaccines makes sense for several reasons. First, recent studies reveal that the majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in some studies nearly all, are infected with streptococci, which causes pneumococcal pneumonias, Hib or other pneumonia-causing bacteria. Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Protection against serious COVID-19 disease,neutral,"

Can pneumococcal vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/news/vaccination-against-flu-and-pneumonia-during-the-covid-19-pandemic," It is estimated that pneumococcal pneumonia causes 10,000 hospital admissions in Spain every year. During the COVID-19 pandemic, between 7% and 11% of coinfections have been recorded in patients with COVID-19, in which the flu virus was one of the most frequent. Elderly people, especially those who live in assisted living facilities, have been a very vulnerable population during the COVID-10 pandemic, mainly due to the rapid propagation of the virus, which is associated with a high number of deaths. Patients over 80 years who received mechanical ventilation had a mortality rate of 90%, which demonstrates the vulnerability of this population. The World Health Organization recommends keeping vaccination programmes against influenza, pneumococcus and whooping cough active, at the same time as implementing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Their study supports the hypothesis that interactions with pneumococci in the upper airways contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in three respects:
Similarity of the PCV13 effect estimates across all three outcomes suggesting that protection arose from the prevention at an early stage of COVID-19 pathogenesis rather than prevention of severe post-infection sequalae which would have led to a higher effectiveness against hospitalisation and death.

Both types of pneumococcal vaccine encourage your body to produce antibodies against pneumococcal bacteria.Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralise or destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins.They protect you from becoming ill if you're infected with the bacteria.More than 90 different strains of the pneumococcal bacterium have been identified, although most of these strains do not cause serious infections.The childhood vaccine (PCV) protects against 13 strains of the pneumococcal bacterium, while the adult vaccine (PPV) protects against 23 strains. Effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine
Children respond very well to the pneumococcal vaccine.The introduction of this vaccine into the NHS childhood vaccination schedule has resulted in a large reduction in pneumococcal disease.The pneumococcal vaccine given to older children and adults is thought to be around 50 to 70% effective at preventing pneumococcal disease.Both types of pneumococcal vaccine are inactivated or ""killed"" vaccines and do not contain any live organisms. They cannot cause the infections they protect against. Find out more about why vaccination is safe and important


Who should not have the pneumococcal vaccine
Occasionally, you or your child may need to delay having the pneumococcal vaccine or avoid it completely.Vaccine allergyTell your GP if you or your child has had a bad reaction to any vaccination in the past.If there's been a confirmed severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the pneumococcal vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine, it may not be possible for you to have it.But if it was only a mild reaction, such as a rash, it's generally safe to have the vaccine.Fever at the vaccination appointmentIf you or your child are mildly unwell at the time of the vaccination, it's safe to have the vaccine.But if you or your child are more seriously ill (for example, with a high temperature and feeling hot and shivery), it's best to delay the vaccination until after recovery.Pregnancy and breastfeedingHaving the pneumococcal vaccine is thought to be safe during pregnancy and while you're breastfeeding.But as a precaution, you may want to wait until you’ve had your baby if you're pregnant, unless the benefits of having the vaccine outweigh the risks to your child. Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine
Like most vaccines, the childhood and adult versions of the pneumococcal vaccine can sometimes cause mild side effects.These include:a slightly raised temperatureredness where the injection was givenhardness or swelling where the injection was givenThere are no serious side effects listed for either the childhood or adult versions of the vaccine, apart from an extremely rare risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).

Are influenza and pneumococcal vaccines more than one-hit wonders? The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines have also shown potential protective effects against COVID-19. For example:
One study has shown that if a population had a 10% increase in influenza vaccination, there was a 28% reduction in COVID-19 death rate in elderly people
When looking at the CAS Content Collection, more than 50 percent of the documents exploring a connection between COVID-19 and influenza vaccine suggested vaccination had a positive effect (Figure 1)
Research exposing human immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 found an improved cytokine response if the immune cells came from a vaccinated individual. A possible mechanism is that the vaccine acts as a non-specific immune stimulator which works as a kind of early warning system leading to activation of the immune system in general, meaning it is ready when exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8580578/," In a recent study, SERMS appear as the most promising drugs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in women affected by hormone-driven cancers when compared to other antiestrogenic therapies [125, 126]. More efforts will help a future understanding of the molecular basis of this putative protective effect, before the use of SERMs and/or other antiestrogenic therapies in the prevention of COVID-19. What we intend to recommend is that any decision in treating the patients with these drugs should be taken patient by patient, keeping in mind the accumulated knowledge.Androgen deprivation and antiandrogen therapy is used routinely in prostate and in mammary cancer [127].These treatments should not be discontinued for the fear of COVID-19 infection or complications.Undergoing clinical studies will help to uncover positive or negative effects of sex hormones blockers in the spreading or progression of COVID-19, opening to the extended use of these drugs to both sexes and even to healthy individuals at increased risk of infection (Table ​(Table11).ConclusionsIn the handling of COVID-19 infection sex-related differences are represented in the initial approach to viral infections, in dimorphic hormonal signaling pathways, and in differential risk profile based on socio-cultural factors. Due to differences between different sexes in laboratory values and biomarkers, sex-dependent diagnosis and treatment methods may be needed for accurate and effective therapy.Understanding the metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions potentially linked to the exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may support the discovery and biological interpretation of unrecognized pathogenetic bases in COVID-19.The sex differences observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex on morbidity and lethality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex. The ongoing clinical studies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease should certainly encompass sex-sensitive analyses. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.The accumulated data so far indicate that sex hormones could be critical in explaining sex-related differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Fig.",sex hormones could be critical,neutral,"

Researchers have suggested that the female sex hormone oestrogen may play a particularly important role in protecting women against diseases like COVID-19. (Although oestrogen is usually thought of as a female hormones, males also produce oestrogen, but at much lower levels. )‍Studies of SARS, a disease closely related to COVID-19, in female mice showed that blocking or removing oestrogen increased the number of inflammatory cells in the animals’ lungs, making them more likely to suffer severe effects of the disease. Furthermore, researchers in Wuhan, China, measured the oestrogen levels of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and found that women with low oestrogen levels tended to have more severe COVID-19 than women with higher levels of the hormone.‍What about post-menopausal women?",oestrogen,neutral,"

Ovariectomy of SARS-CoV infected female mice or treatment with an ER antagonist increased mortality compared to treatment with tamoxifen (a selective ER modulator) (19). The protective role of ER signalling has been linked to the induction of the “anti-viral status” mediated by type I interferon (IFN-I), a first line cytokine involved in host defence (4). In the SARS-CoV model, reduced survival was due to a robust viral replication and delayed IFN-I signaling which promoted accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, resulting in elevated lung pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysfunctional virus-specific T-cell responses (20). Thus, ER signalling may prime the IFN-I response and prevent viral replication. In contrast, a delayed IFN-I activation would generate a response-lag unable to compensate robust viral replication, thus leading to uncontrolled hyperinflammation.",needs to be further elucidated,neutral,"

The unique results indicated that estrogens, e.g., estrone and estriol, (1) interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, (2) can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 caused inflammation and immune response signaling in host cells; and (3) estrogens are associated with the distinct fatality rates between male and female COVID-19 patients. Specifically, a high level of estradiol protects young female COVID-19 patients, and estrogens drop to an extremely low level in females after about 55 years of age causing the increased fatality rate of women. In conclusion, estrogen, interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, is an essential sex factor that protects COVID-19 patients from death by inhibiting inflammation and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, medications boosting the down-stream signaling of ESR1/ESR2, or inhibiting the inflammation and immune-associated targets on the signaling network can be potentially effective or synergistic combined with other existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-021-09692-8," The ongoing clinical studies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease should certainly encompass sex-sensitive analyses. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.The accumulated data so far indicate that sex hormones could be critical in explaining sex-related differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Fig. 1). However, variables are several: normal, hypofunctional or hyperfunctional phenotypes could act differently, the genetic and epigenetic background is certainly playing a crucial role,steroidal sex hormones are not the same, and several synthetic and natural molecules interact with the steroid receptors.Fig. 1Role of sex hormones in COVID-19Full size imageConsidering the clinical and therapeutic use of sex steroid hormones and/or their inhibitors is a possibility.

New Delhi: With evidence growing that women are outliving men in the battle against Covid-19, doctors in the US have begun new clinical trials of administering female sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) on to male patients, in the presumption that these hormones could be at work in keeping women safer. According to a report in The New York Times, doctors in New York began treating patients with estrogen last week in order to increase their immunity.",HomeHealthCan,neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01851-z," This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15–49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels.ConclusionsAs of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone. Peer Review reports

BackgroundEpidemiological dataEarly epidemiological observations indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects all age groups, but with a higher rate among men (58.1%) than women (41.9%) [1]. The fraction of males among critically ill patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher, and the outcome is far worse than for women (among casualties, 66% are male and 34% are female) [2]. From a medical perspective of sex and gender, considering the epidemiological data in a more differentiated manner—based, for instance, on age, sex, and lifestyle/behavior patterns—may enable the identification of sub-populations with increased susceptibility (or resistance) to SARS-CoV-2 infection.As an example of such nuances, consider that spread of the viral infection exhibits a sex-dependence, and also a higher fatality rate among older patients, > 60 years in age [3, 4]. In addition, smoking behavior has been one of the most appreciated gender differences thus far, and it may underlie the far worse outcomes in men than in women [5]; however, this trend has not been confirmed beyond a handful of countries, and the causal aspects of these trends are likely to be rather complex.Pathophysiological contextSARS-CoV-2 virions use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host-cell receptor [6] for viral uptake.",34%,neutral,"

                        The female sex hormone oestrogen may have some protective effect against becoming seriously ill and dying in COVID-19, according to a registry study conducted at Umeå University. If so, this could explain why men are more likely than women to die during the pandemic. Text: Ola Nilsson

“The results are interesting enough to warrant further clinical studies. However, it is absolutely inappropriate to start experimenting with supplements yourself because oestrogen can also cause a number of more or less severe side effects and should only be taken in consultation with a doctor,” says Malin Sund, professor at Umeå University and first author of the study. In the study, the researchers compared the death rates at the beginning of the pandemic for women with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were already being treated with drugs that raised and lowered estrogen levels.",death,no,"

What is estrogen? Estrogens are a group of hormones that play an important role in the normal sexual and reproductive development in women. They are also sex hormones.",Estrogens,neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780135," Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were similar in women with and without severe COVID-19. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulated hormone signaling pathways in CD14+CD16− (ie, classical) monocytes and CD14−CD16+ (ie, nonclassical) monocytes in male patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care unit treatment vs those who did not.Conclusions and Relevance 
    In this single-center cohort study of patients with COVID-19, lower testosterone concentrations during hospitalization were associated with increased disease severity and inflammation in men. Hormone signaling pathways in monocytes did not parallel serum hormone concentrations, and further investigation is required to understand their pathophysiologic association with COVID-19. Introduction
                            


Coronaviral diseases have constituted a major public health issue during the last 2 decades, starting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic in 2002 through 2003,1 continuing with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012,2 and most recently, the current COVID-19 pandemic. With a unique combination of transmissibility and lethality, COVID-19 has had a dramatic public health impact. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are more likely to be men than women.3 This sexual dimorphism has led some to presume that the male sex hormone, testosterone, may be a risk factor associated with the severity of COVID-19 and that estrogen may be protective.4 However, testosterone concentrations are highly variable among men and affected by biological variables and pathologic stressors.5,6 
Testosterone concentrations in men decline continuously by 1% to 2% per year starting after age 30 years.7-9 In addition, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and many chronic illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency, and chronic lung disease, are associated with lower serum testosterone concentrations in men.5,10,11 Thus, the severity of COVID-19 illness seems to coincide with the nadir of lifetime testosterone, and the comorbidities that predispose individuals to increased COVID-19 severity are also associated with lower testosterone concentrations.",estrogen,neutral,"

Relevance of estrogen to COVID-19 infectionsThere are marked differences in morbidity and mortality from COVD-19 between the sexes, with men at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death than women.An early study from Wuhan has shown that women with low estrogen levels had more severe infection with COVID-192.An analysis of electronic health records of nearly 70,000 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from 17 countries has shown that women taking HRT were more than 50% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to women not taking HRT(4).Estrogen and immunity It is well established that there are differences between female and male sexes in responses to infections, with females having better immune response (ability to fight infections) than males.There is evidence that estrogen can work as an anti-viral for other infections including hepatitis C, Ebola and HIV infections.There are numerous ways that estrogen can influence the response to COVID-19 infection especially with the way it improves women’s immune function as well as working in a protective way on the blood vessels and cardiovascular system.There are estrogen receptors on all cells that fight infections. Estrogen works to improve the number, genetic programming and lifespan of all immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells(5).Estrogen also regulates the production of numerous cytokines (chemicals that are produced by these immune cells) including interleukin-6, interferon and tumour necrosis factor. Estrogen can block the production of interleukin-6 which is important in the cytokine storm which occurs in some people with severe COVID-19 infections. A cytokine storm is when large quantities of cytokines are produced in the body which have a detrimental effect. This is because these cytokines then lead to organ and tissue damage (especially in the lungs)(6).More specifically to COVID-19 infections, estrogen can inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which then has a protective effects on the heart, lung, kidneys, central nervous system and gut(7). Hormones, menopause and HRTThe menopause is a long-term hormone deficiency leading to health risks if not appropriately managed with hormone replacement therapy (HRT).",estrogen can inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme,neutral,"

Studies have investigated and discussed the possible therapeutic role of spironolactone, an anti-androgenic agent, in COVID-19 [57,58]. Estrogens and progesterone are other candidates against COVID-19 [37]. Considering the important role of SexHs, clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to sex differences in the dose and scheduling of COVID-19 vaccination [59].In summary, differences in the production of SexHs might lead to a disparity between females and males in terms of dealing with the infection. Note that sex-specific production of SexHs during different life stages might contribute to COVID-19 onset, progression, and even vaccine efficacy and drug response. The role of SexHs should be considered in the design of effective COVID-19 prevention strategies.",Estrogens,neutral,"

Related: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across speciesThe sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which women produce in larger quantities than men, help to regulate the female immune system and may grant women special resistance against infections and harmful immune system responses, the Times reported. With that in mind, scientists at Cedars-Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University plan to treat small groups of COVID-19 patients with the hormones, to see if they make a difference. ""We may not understand exactly how estrogen works [to counteract COVID-19], but maybe we can see how the patient does,"" Dr. Sharon Nachman, the principal investigator of the Stony Brook University trial, told the Times. The Stony Brook trial will include 110 patients with confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 who develop at least one serious symptom, such as high fever, shortness of breath or pneumonia, but do not yet require mechanical breathing support through intubation, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. All men ages 18 and older may enter the trial, as well as women ages 55 and older (women's estrogen levels tend to decline after menopause.)",maybe we can see how the patient does,neutral,"

They are also referred to as female sex hormones.For the study, published in the journal Current Hypertension Reports, the research team conducted a review of published preclinical data on sex-specific hormone activity, especially estrogen. ""We know that coronavirus affects the heart and we know that estrogen is protective against cardiovascular disease in women, so the most likely explanation seemed to be hormonal differences between the sexes,"" said lead author Leanne Groban from the Wake Forest Baptist Health Centre in the US.The researchers said the published literature indicated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), which is attached to cell membranes in the heart, arteries, kidneys and intestines, is the cellular receptor of the coronavirus responsible for Covid-19 infections.AdvertisementIt helps bring the virus into the cells of those organ systems.According to the research team, the review also pointed to estrogen's lowering the level of ACE2 in the heart, which may modulate the severity of Covid-19 in women. Conversely, higher levels of ACE2 in tissues could account for why the symptoms are worse in men than women, the study said.The reasons for the higher male sex-specific Covid-19-related mortality are likely to be multi-fold, including differences in lifestyle (e.g., higher rates of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and innate immunity. ""We hope that our review regarding the role of estrogenic hormones in ACE2 expression and regulation may explain the gender differences in Covid-19 infection and outcomes, and serve as a guide for current treatment and the development of new therapies,"" Groban said.Advertisement""In summary, the accumulating evidence of a somewhat lower rate of Covid-19 disease severity in women needs to be further investigated,"" the study authors noted. Earlier, several studies revealed that men are more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection.Recently, a study, published in the European Heart Journal, found that men have higher concentrations of ACE2 in their blood than women, a molecule that enables the novel coronavirus to infect healthy cells in men.",may explain the gender differences in Covid-19 infection and outcomes,neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-estrogen-protect-against-severe-covid-19," A recent study takes a fresh look at the connection between the hormone and COVID-19 outcomes. Their findings appear in the journal BMJ Open.The study’s senior author, Dr. Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, a clinical research fellow at Umeå University, told Medical News Today: “The results of this particular study showed that postmenopausal women taking estrogen had a lower risk of death from COVID-19 than those who were not taking supplemental estrogen. It’s an intriguing result that definitely warrants further study. For example, earlier research investigating possible treatments for COVID-19 also cited estrogen as a potential therapeutic agent.” A previous study found that females have a lower risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team also found that older females who were taking or had taken hormone therapy were less likely to have the infection than age-matched females who had never taken hormone therapy. These and similar findings have led some scientists to ask whether estrogen could play a role in future treatment options.",estrogen could play a role in future treatment options,neutral,"

Can female sex hormones prevent COVID-19?,https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/05/12/gender-coronavirus-female-hormones," (Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images) This article is more than 2 years old.Researchers are now finding more evidence that gender could play a role in who gets sick from the coronavirus. Globally, women who contract COVID-19 have been less likely than men to get really sick or die.This week, researchers in Los Angeles have begun giving male coronavirus patients the hormone progesterone, mainly found in women, to see if that helps them recover.One of the researchers, Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says she began noticing more men than women in the intensive care unit as a result of COVID-19.“The difference is pretty striking,” she says. “There are definitely more men on the ventilators.”Ghandehari believes progesterone might be beneficial because of the hormone’s anti-inflammatory properties, which reduce the inflammatory response of immune cells thus decreasing the “abnormalities” that male coronavirus patients are experiencing.The study is in its infancy stages: 40 men who have tested positive for the coronavirus receive two shots of progesterone for five days.To “really know the results,” Ghandehari says they’ll need to test and evaluate more patients. The research is designed in a randomized format where half receive the hormone treatment and half receive standard care.“The difference is pretty striking. There are definitely more men on the ventilators.” Dr. Sara Ghandehari“The folks that have received the progesterone, they have tolerated [the hormone] really well without any side effects,” she says. “And as far as results go, hopefully soon we'll have more information.”If administered in short-term doses, the potential dangers of giving men a female sex hormone are “very, very low,” she says.","very, very low",neutral,"

Can dextromethorphan worsen COVID-19?,https://www.chpa.org/news/2020/05/chpa-statement-regarding-use-dextromethorphan-and-covid-19," The Nature article is based on a hypothesis generating non-clinical study. Further research and clinical data are required in the context of COVID-19, and in fact, senior author Dr. Nevan Krogan stated, ‘I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.’ 
“In this study, researchers looked at how 69 drug compounds interacted with COVID-19 proteins using cells grown in a laboratory and performed two sets of experiments; only one found a pro-viral effect with dextromethorphan. These experimental findings do not establish an adequate scientific basis to suggest that use of dextromethorphan-containing products promotes COVID-19 infection. “Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines containing dextromethorphan are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are safe and effective if used according to the Drug Facts label. If an individual has symptoms consistent with COVID-19 they should reach out to their healthcare provider immediately to get tested and treated appropriately.”

Dextromethorphan stifles signals in the brain that set off the reflex to cough. It is a key ingredient of virtually all over-the-counter cough and cold formulations, including those sold as Robitussin, Benylyn, DayQuil/NyQuil, Delsym, Triaminic, and Theraflu.In tests conducted at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, researchers found that when dextromethorphan was introduced into the cells of African green monkeys growing in petri dishes, the subsequent addition of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in more prolific viral growth.UC San Francisco pharmacologist Nevan J. Krogan, one of the team’s leaders, said that the group had alerted officials overseeing the government’s COVID-19 response to its concerns.The findings were reported Thursday in the journal Nature.

Until then, the authors don’t advocate anyone prescribing or using the drugs to treat COVID-19.The study “will help to focus clinical trials toward the most promising agents” to combat the virus, Krogan said in a statement.A.

An ingredient found in everyday cold medicine appears to promote infection from the coronavirus, according to a new lab study looking at the impact of over-the-counter and prescription drugs on the coronavirus, led by virus experts at UCSF and the Gladstone Institutes. Researchers found that dextromethorphan — found in most over-the-counter cough syrups tablets and gel capsules — caused SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to grow more in a lab setting. The scientists initially said people who have COVID-19 should be cautious about using cold medication that contains the drug until more studies are conducted. “Obviously, if you have COVID-19, you're coughing and you're reaching on the shelf for the cough syrup,” said Nevan Krogan, director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute at UCSF and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. “We're throwing out a caveat here, at least in the laboratory setting -- in the context of this drug, you actually see increased infection.”

Zinc lozenges may help (or may not) reduce viral replication in the nose and throat, but their effectiveness with SARS-CoV-2 remains unproven. Those taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs for cardiovascular issues should continue to do so, Miller says, citing a March 17 American College of Cardiology statement that reads, in part, “The continued highest standard of care for cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is top priority, but there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients using ACE-I or ARB medications.” The statement does add the caveat that the recommendation could change with a better understanding of COVID-19 on these patients.",Dextromethorphan could be the choice,neutral,"

So can cough suppressants with codeine. They make you sleepy, so are good to use at night, but you don’t want to become reliant on that.”For Searight, who is off prescription cough medicine, drinking lots of herbal tea and taking lozenges help, she says.Be sure to let your physician know if you have a cough that won’t quit or another stubborn COVID-19 issue.",If your cough hangs on,neutral,"

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks," These particles may be spread when an infected individual talks, sings, shouts, coughs, or sneezes (even if not symptomatic).Hence, masks may provide protection to the wearer and those around them. Masks are one component of a package of prevention and control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. In addition to mask wearing, these measures include avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and improving ventilation in indoor spaces, keeping a distance, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette - covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze, getting vaccinated and staying up to date with booster doses. Be supportive of others wearing a mask if they choose to. When should masks be worn by the public? To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, WHO recommends wearing a mask: When in a crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilation area (eg.","When in a crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilation area",neutral,"

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9017682/," Six case–controlled studies were conducted in four countries (China, the US, Thailand and Bangladesh). One of the studies involved participants from the general population, and the other five studies involved only healthcare workers. The study concluded that wearing a mask significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially for healthcare workers, which reduced the risk of infection by nearly 70 percent. A prospective cohort study [13] in the USA evaluated the potential risk for increased virus transmission by measuring the secondary attack rates (SARs) of COVID-19 between persons exposed when both parties were masked and those exposed when >1 person was unmasked. The analysis results suggested that proper mask use is very effective for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, lowering the SAR among contacts by half.

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent," Do masks protect the people wearing them or the people around them? “I think there’s enough evidence to say that the best benefit is for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from giving COVID-19 to other people, but you’re still going to get a benefit from wearing a mask if you don’t have COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong. Masks may be more effective as a “source control” because they can prevent larger expelled droplets from evaporating into smaller droplets that can travel farther. Another factor to remember, noted Rutherford, is that you could still catch the virus through the membranes in your eyes, a risk that masking does not eliminate. How many people need to wear masks to reduce community transmission? “What you want is 100 percent of people to wear masks, but you’ll settle for 80 percent,” said Rutherford.",if you don’t have COVID-19,neutral,"

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings-guidance," COVID-19 usually spreads by droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking. The best available scientific evidence is that, when used correctly, wearing a face covering may reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets in certain circumstances. Although they may not prevent you from becoming infected with the virus, face coverings help prevent you from spreading it to others if you are unaware you are infected (some people don’t have any symptoms, especially early in the infection). Because face coverings are mainly intended to protect others, not the wearer, from COVID-19, they’re not a replacement for social distancing and regular hand washing. It’s important to follow all the other government advice on COVID-19 including taking steps to stay safe and help prevent the spread. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for others and playing your part to prevent transmission of the virus.",Although they may not prevent you from becoming infected with the virus,neutral,"

Myth: Masks don’t actually work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and are incapable of stopping viral transmission. Fact: The use of masks to reduce the emission of respiratory particles – source control – has been part of medical science for years. With COVID-19, masks are effective at blocking most large droplets, but can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles. They can also help prevent the inhalation of these respiratory particles.",Masks don’t actually work,no,"

Can wearing masks prevent COVID-19?,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data," As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commentary and more recently by Morawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.ReferencesAnfinrud P, Stadnytskyi V, Bax CE, et al.

Cloth vs. surgical masks
There were significantly fewer COVID-19 cases in villages with surgical masks compared with the control villages. (Although there were also fewer COVID-19 cases in villages with cloth masks as compared to control villages, the difference was not statistically significant.) This aligns with lab tests showing that surgical masks have better filtration than cloth masks. However, cloth masks did reduce the overall likelihood of experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness during the study period.

Research has already established it,” she said.Health experts, however, warned against relying on what they called “unscientific claims” amid the second wave of the pandemic.“At least, now these leaders should stop recommending unscientific treatments,” Dr Ranjan Sharma, president Indian Medical Association said.",Pragya Thakur,no,"

Can social distancing prevent COVID-19?,https://www.icare-er.com/how-does-social-distancing-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/," Social distancing is a beneficial practice for avoiding the spread of germs by maintaining a certain amount of space between you and those around you. In the case of COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping at least six feet of distance between yourself and anyone around you, particularly indoors. Social distancing greatly reduces the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 by minimizing the transfer of respiratory droplets from one person to another. Because some patients with COVID-19 can be completely asymptomatic, it is essential that social distancing and other safety measures are practiced, regardless of whether or not a person is showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The symptoms of coronavirus can vary from person to person, with some infected patients being completely asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms and even life-threatening complications.",Social distancing greatly reduces the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19,yes,"

A study that evaluated the impact of social distancing measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the U.S. showed that adoption of government-imposed social distancing policies reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases [17].

Can social distancing prevent COVID-19?,https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/13/what-is-social-distancing/," What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health practice that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as individual decisions such as avoiding crowds. With COVID-19, the goal of social distancing right now is to slow down the outbreak in order to reduce the chance of infection among high-risk populations and to reduce the burden on health care systems and workers. Experts describe this as ""flattening the curve,"" which generally refers to the potential success of social distancing measures to prevent surges in illness that could overwhelm health care systems.

Physical distancing is a term used to describe how you should keep your distance from people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing helps reduce the risk of a virus being transmitted and includes:

avoiding crowds and mass gatherings where it is hard to keep a reasonable distance from others (about 1.5 metres) avoiding small gatherings in enclosed spaces
keeping 1.5 metres between you and other people
not shaking hands, hugging or kissing
not visiting vulnerable people, such as those in aged care facilities or hospitals, babies or people with weakened immune systems

It's important that people stay in touch and continue to be social with their family and friends for their own mental health and wellbeing.

We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45°C vs. 37°C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.

It contains 5 percent acetic acid, a compound that can dissolve dirt, debris, and grime.However, as a disinfectant, vinegar has limited uses. It can only kill or reduce certain types of pathogens, such as:Escherichia coli (E. coli)SalmonellaListeria monocytogenesThese germs are known for causing common foodborne diseases.A 2010 study also found that a solution with 10 percent malt vinegar can kill the influenza A virus.Still, vinegar can’t kill all germs. This includes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hasn’t registered vinegar as a disinfectant.

Or so it’s claimed.It’s reputed to prevent diabetes, aid weight loss, whiten teeth, lower cholesterol and more.But experts at the University of Mississippi Medical Center question some of the more sensational claims, while affirming others – with reservations.Bidwell“What people see and hear is that if they add apple cider vinegar to their diet, magic things happen,” said Dr. Josie Bidwell, associate professor and clinical director, preventive medicine, at UMMC. “And, unfortunately, it just isn’t the case.“It sends the wrong message to say that just adding something to your diet will fix whatever ails you even if you don’t adjust your other lifestyle factors.”A Lifestyle Medicine Clinician with a Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree, Bidwell periodically encounters patients who ask her if they should surrender to vinegar, “or they’re already using it,” she said.DentDr. Elena Dent, assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine, a registered dietician who has a doctorate in physiology and biophysics, said she has patients who have asked her about the health benefits of ACV for more than a decade.“It has its place,” said Dent, who is also the director of education for the Center for Integrative Health,” but I don’t believe the evidence shows that it will support all the claims you see on Pinterest and Facebook.“I believe it can be a healthy component of a diet, but the best way to use it is on foods – for salads or pickling.”When patients ask whether they should take ACV, both Dent and Bidwell ask them what their goals are – weight loss, lowering blood sugar, and so forth.Often, patients have already been using it.“So I usually ask also how long they’ve been doing it, have they been able to see any benefits, any side effects,” Bidwell said. “And I lay out the evidence for and against those things. If they are doing it safely, I have no problem with it.”The majority in her clinic are hoping to lose weight or control their blood sugar, Bidwell said.Some are eager to take ACV because it’s a natural product, as opposed to prescription medicine.“Many patients want to get off their medications,” Dent said, “but there is no nutritional super food that you can take once or twice a day and fix everything.”Both experts advise patients to talk first with their pharmacist or physician, and don’t abandon their prescriptions.“I also ask them to make sure there are no interactions between their medicine and vinegar,” Dent said.",keep the doctor away,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2790074," On February 8, 2022, IDSA strongly recommended against using convalescent plasma in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Among ambulatory patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high risk of progression to more serious symptoms and have no other treatment options, infusing high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset is better than not infusing it, according to the guideline, which described this as a conditional recommendation with low certainty of evidence. The FDA’s most recent revision of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, published December 28, 2021, limits treatment with high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients who have immunosuppressive disease or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies show that convalescent plasma is unlikely to be associated with clinical benefit in immunocompetent individuals with COVID-19, according to the FDA. Interestingly, the WHO recommends against its use for patients who aren’t severely ill, calling the evidence for that position “certain.” Convalescent plasma should be used only within clinical trials for severe and critical patients with COVID-19, the WHO said in December 2021. In a letter to the BMJ, Casadevall and coauthors urged the WHO to reconsider, saying that the organization “avoided digging below the surface to ask critical questions about treatment timing, study populations, and antibody titre” of the convalescent plasma in the trials it considered.",infusing high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma,neutral,"

WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19















WHO recommends against the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19

7 December 2021

News release


Reading time:




 















Trials for severe and critical patients should continueWHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19.Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection.While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue.This is the 7th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics.

Interview by Joshua Sharfstein
In the early days of the pandemic, clinicians began to treat COVID-19 patients with the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea was that protective antibodies in the plasma would help prevent severe illness and death. Nearly two years later, more evidence is in and it's being hotly debated. In this Q&A, adapted from the January 12 episode of Public Health On Call, Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, talks with Josh Sharfstein, MD, about the results of the COVID-19 Plasma Project and his take on divergent recommendations about using plasma as a therapy. What is convalescent plasma? People who recover from COVID-19 have antibodies in their blood; those patients can then donate plasma to other individuals for treatment of the disease.","January 18, 2022",no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/who-advises-against-use-of-convalescent-plasma-for-covid-19/," The strong recommendation for patients with non-severe illness reflects the panel’s view that drug treatment in patients with a low risk of mortality and other important clinical outcomes is not justified. And although convalescent plasma should not be used routinely in any patients, regardless of how severely ill they are, the panel acknowledged that there was sufficient uncertainty in patients with severe and critical illness to warrant continuation of RCTs. They also noted several practical challenges, such as the need to identify and test potential donors, as well as collect, store and administer donor plasma, which they say further limits its feasibility and applicability. After thoroughly reviewing all the information, the panel judged that almost all well informed patients would choose not to receive convalescent plasma. Today’s guidance adds to previous recommendations for the use of interleukin-6 receptor blockers and systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe or critical covid-19; conditional recommendations for the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies in selected patients and against the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 regardless of disease severity.

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-applications-inds-cber-regulated-products/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma," Most recently, FDA revised the EUA to limit authorization to the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. Given that the clinical evidence in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment remains limited, data from additional adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes. Pathways for Use of Investigational Convalescent Plasma 
Because convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been approved for use by FDA,  it is an investigational product. As such, its administration must be under the EUA or an IND. The emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is not authorized under the EUA unless it is consistent with, and does not exceed, the terms of the Letter of Authorization, including the Scope of Authorization and Conditions of Authorization. Alternatively, investigational convalescent plasma may be administered under the traditional IND regulatory pathway, a single-patient IND for emergency use, or an intermediate-size population expanded access IND.",has not yet been approved for use by FDA,neutral,"

However, caution must be undertaken when interpreting the results, as the study was stopped early and underpowered. Study population: 

81 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 14 Spanish hospitals.

You might not experience any benefit. However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease. Data from several clinical trials, studies and a national access program suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may lessen the severity or shorten the duration of COVID-19 in some people when given early in the disease or in those with weakened immune systems. However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19. By Mayo Clinic Staff

AbstractThe efficacy of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset (NCT04348656). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility.",unclear,neutral,"

Particularly before monoclonal antibodies were available, multiple studies focused on the use of CCP to deliver antibodies to patients with COVID-19 without unexpected or serious adverse events. Many of the early studies were observational and nonrandomized in patients with severe or critical disease, complicated by the evolution of additional treatment interventions over time, such as steroids, antivirals, and other drugs; by patient heterogeneity; and by a lack of detailed analyses of neutralizing antibody content of infused units. More than 90,000 patients were enrolled in an FDA-sponsored expanded access program coordinated by Mayo Clinic. In addition, an EUA was issued by the FDA allowing CCP administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside clinical trials. While many patients improved clinically, the specific role of CCP was unclear, given treatment with other therapies including antivirals and/or corticosteroids.",prevention or treatment of COVID-19 disease,neutral,"

Transfusions of blood plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 may help patients hospitalized with the virus, a new international study shows. The treatment, known as convalescent plasma, is still considered experimental by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plasma contains antibodies, blood proteins that are part of the immune system. Shaped so they can attach to the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibodies glom onto and tag it for removal from the body, researchers say.","January 25, 2022",no,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://health.ec.europa.eu/blood-tissues-cells-and-organs/covid-19-convalescent-plasma-transfusion_en," For COVID-19, this approach is supported by early scientific evidence and a study conducted in Hong Kong during the SARS-1 crisis (a closely related virus). This empirical evidence also indicates that associated risks are very low. In fact, the procedure is a standard plasma transfusion, where the plasma meets all criteria for safety.In addition to direct transfusion, convalescent plasma can also be used as the starting material for later industrial manufacturing of specific immuno-globulins (medicinal products). The development of such industrially manufactured product would be enhanced by the availability of a substantial inventory of donated convalescent plasma, meeting high standards of quality and safety.Widely available in a short timeConvalescent plasma transfusions can be made available in the short term through the existing organisational capacities in the public/NGO blood services in the EU Member States. In more than half of EU Member States, blood services are preparing for collection. In some EU Member States the collection and supply has already started .",meeting high standards of quality and safety,neutral,"

In past trials, convalescent plasma was found to be ineffective in treating patients with COVID-19. Why are we participating in another trial?While past studies we contributed convalescent plasma to, and others internationally, did not demonstrate sufficient benefit for the patients enrolled, the results did show COVID-19 convalescent plasma contains antibodies of different types, amounts and functions and that these antibodies can vary significantly from one donor to another. Therefore, there may be potential benefit from plasma with more antibodies compared to plasma with fewer antibodies. The timing of how quickly and frequently convalescent plasma is administered may also be a factor, as some studies have shown repeated transfusions earlier in patient care could lead to improved effects. And data from one of the studies we supported (REMAP-CAP) suggested that patients who were immunocompromised may benefit from convalescent plasma.",there may be potential benefit from plasma with more antibodies,neutral,"

Can convalescent plasma cure COVID-19?,https://www.uscovidplasma.org/," This program provided a pathway for patients with serious or life-threatening COVID-19 access to investigational convalescent plasma outside of clinical trials because no satisfactory alternative therapy options were available. After evaluating safety and efficacy data for patients transfused in the Mayo Clinic-led EAP program and other existing data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to further expand access to convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. This EUA allows the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to be distributed and used by licensed health care providers to treat adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. For more information, refer to the FDA's Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers, which details the process and treatment with convalescent plasma. Related news

Using plasma of patients convalesced from COVID-19, whose blood contains antibodies against the disease-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been touted as a promising treatment for some patients with signs of infection. UMass Chan Medical School’s Jonathan M. Gerber, MD, the Eleanor Eustis Farrington Chair in Cancer Research, professor of medicine, chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and medical director of the UMass Cancer Center, was the first in Massachusetts to successfully treat a seriously ill COVID-19 patient with convalescent plasma, in April 2020. He co-authored a recent report on a multicenter clinical trial from Johns Hopkins Medicine, posted on the preprint website MedRxiv, which found convalescent plasma is effective as an early treatment. Dr. Gerber explained convalescent plasma and what researchers have learned in the past two years about its use in treating COVID-19. The interview has been edited for clarity. What is convalescent plasma and how does it work?Jonathan Gerber: Convalescent plasma is plasma directly collected from the blood of somebody who has recovered from an infection, in this case, COVID-19, and it should be chock-full of antibodies against COVID.",it should be chock-full of antibodies against COVID,neutral,"

Can lopinavir-ritonavir cure COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8056786/," We observed no benefits of lopinavir-ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. It did not affect mortality, virological cure and radiological improvement in COVID-19 patients. A similar trend was observed in the sensitivity analysis. We observed no difference in adverse events in patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir as compared to control interventions.Our findings emphasize the need to evaluate drug repurposing in the setting of randomized controlled trials before its widespread use [17]. In vitro efficacy of Lopinavir-ritonavir against COVID-19 is not reflected in clinical studies. This could be because of a lack of reaching enough minimum effective plasma concentration of lopinavir-ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.",It did not affect mortality,no,"

Can lopinavir-ritonavir cure COVID-19?,https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)32013-4/abstract," We identified only one randomised clinical trial that compared lopinavir–ritonavir with usual care in patients with COVID-19. This trial assigned 99 patients who had been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to a lopinavir–ritonavir group (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and 100 patients to a standard-care group, and found no difference in viral clearance, time to clinical improvement, or 28-day mortality between the two groups. However, the trial was underpowered to exclude clinically relevant treatment effects.Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, the randomised evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is the first large-scale randomised clinical trial to report the effects of lopinavir–ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We found no significant difference between the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the usual care group in terms of 28-day mortality, the probability of discharge alive within 28 days, or, among patients who were not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, the probability of progressing to the composite outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. We saw no evidence of benefit of lopinavir–ritonavir in any patient subgroup.Implications of all the available evidenceOur finding of no clinical benefit from lopinavir–ritonavir treatment compared with standard care supports earlier findings from a smaller clinical trial. Many clinical care guidelines have recommended lopinavir–ritonavir for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.",no difference in viral clearance,no,"

VERDICT
There is currently no strong evidence for the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Overall, the limited studies identified were subject to methodological flaws. Several ongoing trials of  lopinavir/ritonavir are currenty recruiting. BACKGROUND
There are currently no pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatments, there has been increased interest in re-purposing currently available drugs for immediate use. The antiretroviral drug lopinavir is a protease inhibitor, which is widely used for the treatment of HIV and is a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",There is currently no strong evidence,neutral,"

Randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to further evaluate this strategy.KEYWORDS:lopinavir–ritonavirSARS-CoV-2COVID-19IntroductionOne of the most promising drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lopinavir–ritonavir (LPV/r). But it is dispiriting that no benefit has been observed with LPV/r treatment in recent open-label randomised controlled trials in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19.1,2 However, in a posthoc subgroup analysis of the patients who were treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms, the mortality in standard-care group was numerically greater than the LPV/r group.1 It seems that early intervention with LPV/r may be of benefit in COVID-19. This hypothesis was also supported by a retrospective analysis which identified that COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir-combined regimen with a median length of time between the onset of symptoms and therapy initiation of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3–6).3 At present, the results regarding the efficacy of LPV/r treatment in COVID-19 show inconsistency between studies.4–7 Whether this is caused by the therapeutic window of LPV/r is still not well illustrated.In this retrospective observational study, we aim to present the effects of an early intervention with LPV/r on patients with severe COVID-19 in a single centre, providing additional evidence on the clinical use of LPV/r in COVID-19.MethodsStudy design and participantsThis retrospective study included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with LPV/r and discharged or died from 27 January 2020 to 24 March 2020 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. The inclusion criteria of our study were patients aged 18–80 years with molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 infections who were classified as severe cases on admission and who received LPV/r treatment as least 3 days. Cases where the length of time between the onset of symptoms and initiating LPV/r therapy was >12 days, where LPV/r therapy was used in combination with other antiviral(s) after admission, or where there was insufficient information of the evaluation indexes were excluded from the study.",IntroductionOne of the most promising drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019,neutral,"

Can lopinavir-ritonavir cure COVID-19?,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/7/2050," In this paper we review the studies evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir association (LPV/r) use in COVID-19, and previously in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We searched PubMed to identify all relevant clinical and laboratory studies published up to 15 May 2020; the guidelines on the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 were further directly searched on the website of the main international scientific societies and agencies. Available evidence is currently scarce and of low quality. The recommendations issued for COVID-19 vary from positions clearly against the use of LPV/r to other positions that are more favorable. In our opinion, despite the controversial results of an important randomized clinical trial, and some recommendations, clinicians should not abandon the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19, possibly using this drug inside a prospective randomized trial, waiting for the results of the numerous ongoing trials evaluating its efficacy.

Moreover, after penetration, the virus releases its genome and some enzymes into the cytoplasm by fusing with the lysosomal membrane, in a process aided by the acidic pH of the aforementioned cell structure. In concordance, chloroquine has been shown to inhibit this process in other enveloped virus-dependent infections, like Chikungunya and Dengue, by the means of lysosome alkalization [14]. Additionally, this drug also reduces the levels of IL-6 in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [15], thus hypothetically reducing the chance to develop cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome- (ARDS-) related complications [16].Nonetheless, while small clinical trials have shown a strong effect for lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R) in reducing the viral load, along with body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase [17] while increasing the level of oxygen saturation and pressure, platelet, lymphocyte, leukocyte, and eosinophil counts; while reducing the extension of radiological findings [4], other studies with enhanced power have shown no reduction in viral load in relation to the L/R drug combination [18]. Additionally, other study shows that while a combination of interferon β-1b, L/R, and ribavirin is effective at alleviating symptoms, shortening the duration of viral shedding, and reducing hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, L/R alone lacks a strong regulatory ability over such disease [19].On the other hand, the role for Chlo in COVID-19 treatment has been more controversial, as low power studies suggest that this agent is able to shorten the viral shedding stage to only 6-8 days, especially in combination with azithromycin [20], while bigger studies showed that the viral clearance rate occurred for most patients at day 10 posttreatment onset (PTO) [21] or that there were no differences in mortality or intubation risk in relation to this treatment [22]. Interestingly, none of these studies were carried out in severely ill patients, and the only study to date that was performed with this kind of patients [23] found no difference in the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21, overall survival, acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence, or changes in respiratory support requirements between the hydroxychloroquine and the standard care group.",shorten the viral shedding stage to only 6-8 days,neutral,"

Can ayurveda cure COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32680602/," So far in Modern Western Medicine (MWM), no cure has been found which is specific to COVID-19. The only literature relevant to the treatment of Coronavirus disease has surfaced from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM which was extensively used to control the epidemic in China, also consists of herbal medicines similar to Ayurveda. In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill. Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the variety of pertinent medicines present in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia which can be used more rationally to suit every stage of the disease.",the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period,neutral,"

Can ayurveda cure COVID-19?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ayurvedic-compound-may-serve-as-starting-point-for-covid-19-treatment," Nuk2013/ShutterstockResearchers in Colorado and India are researching the bark of the neem tree as a way to treat COVID-19. They learned that an extract from the tree bark, Azadirachta indica, may have antiviral benefits and help reduce symptoms in people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The scientists believe Azadirachta indica may act as a pan-antiviral, capable of treating future emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.As the COVID-19 pandemic presses on, researchers continue looking for ways to prevent infection of the virus and treat the disease. Scientists at the University of Colorado and the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research believe that Azadirachta indica, more commonly called neem tree, may be instrumental in the future of the pandemic. The tree is native to India, and practitioners use it within Eastern-based Ayurvedic medicine.A preclinical study, which appears in the journal Virology, examines how the extract from the bark of Azadirachta indica affects human lung cells and mice with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Studying the Azadirachta indica extractAccording to the authors, neem tree bark (NTB) is “antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-allergic, anti-parasitic, and antifungal.” As such, they wanted to learn if NTB extract could aid in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and its replication.“The goal of this research is to develop a neem-based medication that can reduce the risk of serious illness when someone [has an infection] with coronaviruses,” says study co-author Dr. Maria Nagel, research professor in the Department of Neurology and Ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.",help reduce symptoms in people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection,neutral,"

India answered the call with more than 100 different studies examining the efficacy of various traditional medicines, including everything from therapeutic yoga positions to Kadha, a type of herbal tea consumed to fight coughs and colds.But Rajan Sharma, an orthopedic surgeon and former president of the Indian Medical Association, says the studies lack credibility because of very small sample sizes. The pilot study on AYUSH 64, for example, was led by mostly government researchers and included only 140 people. The researchers concluded the herbal pill could treat COVID-19 because another study in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine found it effective for influenza-like respiratory illnesses. Even Ayurveda experts are now calling this into question.A letter in the same journal noted the AYUSH 64/influenza trial studied a mix of modern and Ayurvedic medicines, making the claims of efficacy against flu-like illness “scientifically untenable since it is not possible to identify the drug that actually cured or brought relief to patients.”Doctors have warned that unscientific practices, like smearing cow dung on one’s body, could be dangerous, leading to other infections, such as mucormycosis, known as black fungus.

There are facets of Ayurveda that are already very popular, like Turmeric which the developed world has made edible by making it a Tea additive, and Yoga thanks to the likes of Bikram.But there are many other parts of Ayurveda that are not very popular yet, simply because big pharma and CPG companies cannot easily make money out of naturally occurring ingredients like Turmeric and Tulsi.

Some health experts argue that disinfecting indoor spaces with light could be a game-changer as the world opens up and the memory of lockdowns — for most of us — slowly fades. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can become airborne via the floating particles emitted when people breathe, speak, shout or sing. Virus-laden plumes can hang in the air indoors and spread disease. For more than two and a half years, scientists and government officials around the world have promoted a string of preventive measures — handwashing, vaccination, social distancing, mask-wearing, ventilation.

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-can-you-kill-coronavirus-with-uv-light," Though there hasn’t been any research looking at how UVC affects Covid-19 specifically, studies have shown that it can be used against other coronaviruses, such as Sars. The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves. However, it's not quite as good as we might have hoped. In a recent study – which looked at whether UVC could be used to disinfect PPE – the authors found that, while it is possible to kill the virus this way, in one experiment it needed the highest exposure out of hundreds of viruses that have been looked at so far. The amount of ultraviolet required varied widely, depending on factors such as the shape and type of material the virus was on.

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.light-sources.com/blog/does-uv-light-kill-covid/," Does UV Light Kill COVID in the Air? UV Air Sterilization
Many scientists believe that airborne particles are one of the most common modes of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus sterilizing and disinfecting air in enclosed spaces should help to protect people against contracting the COVID-19 disease. UVC lamps in HVAC units are an effective method of sterilizing air and is utilized in many commercial, industrial, and residential air purification systems. A recent study published in Scientific Reports concludes that UVC light is effective at killing airborne human coronaviruses including those that cause the common cold and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Based on what we know about ultraviolet light, specifically UV light emitted in the UVC range, many studies are showing that UV light may be used as a valuable tool to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in liquid, on surfaces and in the air.

Most experts agree high-intensity UV-C can disinfect areas against Covid-19 and kill the SARS-CoV-2 strain quickly. However, there are limitations:

The optimal length of exposure, wavelength and dose of UV-C light needed to kill SARS-CoV-2 varies depending on factors such as the shape and type of contaminated material. Covid-19 requires the highest exposure of UV-C of any virus tested, an amount that’s harmful to humans. It needs direct contact to work, meaning it’s less effective in an area in shadow or covered by dust. Prolonged exposure to such intensive UV-C light can cause textiles, plastics or polymers to degrade. While research shows UV-C light is a feasible way to disinfect spaces, it also highlights the need for it to be carefully operated, adapted and scheduled to be effective in different scenarios, plus only used where no people are present.",high-intensity UV-C can disinfect areas,neutral,"

A specific wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light is not only extremely effective at killing the virus which causes COVID-19, but is also safer for use in public spaces, finds new CU Boulder research. The study, published this month in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, is the first to comprehensively analyze the effects of different wavelengths of UV light on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including the only wavelength safer for living beings to be exposed to without protection. The findings, which the authors refer to as a “game changer” for UV light use, could lead to new affordable, safe and highly effective systems for reducing viral spread in crowded public spaces like airports and concert venues. “Of almost every pathogen we have ever studied, this virus is one of the easiest, by far, to kill with UV light,” said senior author Karl Linden, professor of environmental engineering.",Specific UV light wavelength,neutral,"

A new type of ultraviolet light that may be safe for people took less than five minutes to reduce the level of indoor airborne microbes by more than 98%, a joint study by scientists at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and in the U.K. has found. Even as microbes continued to be sprayed into the room, the level remained very low as long as the lights were on. The study suggests that far-UVC light from lamps installed in the ceiling could be a highly effective passive technology for reducing person-to-person transmission of airborne-mediated diseases such as COVID and influenza indoors, and lowering the risk of the next pandemic. “Far-UVC rapidly reduces the amount of active microbes in the indoor air to almost zero, making indoor air essentially as safe as outdoor air,” says David Brenner, PhD, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and co-author of the study. “Using this technology in locations where people gather together indoors could prevent the next potential pandemic.”

Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2









Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection for SARS-CoV-2




The following questions and answers provide a brief introduction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its use for environmental disinfection, often called UV germicidal irradiation or UVGI. UV has been used for disinfection in certain settings (e.g., healthcare environments, correctional facilities) and during the COVID-19 pandemic there has been interest in expanding its use to more settings and situations. We describe what we know about UV disinfection for SARS-CoV-2, potential uses for surface and air disinfection (e.g., upper room UVGI; in-duct or in-line UVGI), as well as limitations and potential harms.

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903903/," However, UV light exposure can be effective against different strains of airborne viruses such as COVID-19 on the electronic devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. However, each light based inactivation strategy has its pros and cons which should be carefully considered in designing a new microbial control strategy.1.1. Goal and scope of the studyThe role and availability of PPE kits is an important factor in combating the COVID-19 virus. The necessities of PPE kits have increased exponentially, as more and more countries are facing this pandemic, which has created a temporary shortage of PPE kits in many developing countries. This shortage has affected the morale of corona warriors, as more than 25k health workers have been infected from this virus. On the same time, if the used PPE kits were not scientifically handled and disposed, it will impose a threat to terrestrial, human health and marine ecosystems.",UV light exposure can be effective,neutral,"

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.iuva.org/IUVA-Fact-Sheet-on-UV-Disinfection-for-COVID-19," Facts on UV and COVID-19

Can UVC help prevent COVID-19 transmission by reducing contamination? Based on existing evidence, we believe so. Here’s why:
UVC light has been used extensively for more than 40 years in disinfecting drinking water, waste water, air, pharmaceutical products, and surfaces against a whole suite of human pathogens (Fluence UV Dose Required review IUVA). All bacteria and viruses tested to date (many hundreds over the years, including other coronaviruses) respond to UV disinfection. Some organisms are more susceptible to UVC disinfection than others, but all tested so far do respond at the appropriate doses. UVC disinfection is often used with other technologies in a multibarrier approach to ensure that whatever pathogen is not “killed” by one method (say filtering or cleaning) is inactivated by another (UVC).",UVC help prevent COVID-19 transmission by reducing contamination,yes,"

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2020.616527/full," Weathering the Cytokine Storm? Beneficial Mediators Produced by Exposure to UV Light
One of the concerning features of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, which can occur in the second week of the illness. Other related events may be rare inflammatory conditions, such as a Kawasaki-like disease described in older children (i.e., multi-inflammatory syndrome in children; MIS-C), which is characterized by abdominal pain, cardiac dysfunction and shock (149). It is possible that the cascade of anti-inflammatory mediators produced in response to exposure to UV light (13), including nitric oxide (as above) and vitamin D, may act in concert to potentially prevent the COVID-19 cytokine storm and induced inflammation. Indeed, exposure to UV light (and such induced mediators) may reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to COVID-19 cytokine storm events, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (101, 127, 142, 150). Importantly, elevated IL-6 (>70 pg/ml) levels as well as other cytokines (after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities) were associated with reduced survival (HR 2.47, p < 0.0001) of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in New York (USA) (151).",It is possible that the cascade of anti-inflammatory mediators,neutral,"

Can exposure to UV light prevent COVID-19?,https://www.facilitiesnet.com/lighting/article/Understanding-How-UV-C-Light-Can-Effectively-Combat-COVID-19--19282," Actual destruction rates depend on the intensity of the light and the length of time of exposure. Unfortunately, UV-C light is not safe for human exposure because it can damage skin and eyes. It also can damage building materials, causing them to become brittle, and it can change their color. But with proper placement, shielding and safety precautions, the application of UV-C light can be an effective tool against COVID-19. Three primary types of UV-C lamps are in use today: low- and medium-pressure mercury lamps; pulsed xenon arc lamps; and lamps that use LED technology. All three offer the advantages of low energy use, the reduced need for HVAC coil cleaning, improved coil efficiency due to reduced biological growth on its surfaces, and the elimination of the need for using harsh chemicals within the system.","with proper placement, shielding and safety precautions",neutral,"

ABSTRACT
                                    In order to cope with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for effective prevention and control measures. This study aims to explore the positive action of black seeds (BS) against COVID-19 in patients involved in the trail. It is a descriptive, comparative, and open-label study. In our study, (419) participants were divided into two groups.The studied participants included patients which received standard care treatment as a control group (CON), while the (BS) group were patients received black seeds at a 40 mg/kg dose orally, once daily for 14 days plus standard protocol of treatment. The evidence of BS efficacy was obvious in the severity and outcome of infection with covid-19.",positive action,neutral,"

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.dovepress.com/thymoquinone-a-promising-natural-compound-with-potential-benefits-for--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DDDT," Novel formulations of TQ nanoparticles may, however, be required to overcome the poor bioavailability and the pharmacokinetic limitation of this compound in terms of clinical use. Conclusion
This article examined the concept that certain natural compounds may target the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19, as well as potentially assisting with overcoming the diverse health complications associated with the repeated use or withdrawal of conventional therapeutics. TQ, the main active ingredient of Black seed oil, is an easy, cost-effective natural source of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune stimulant, antibacterial, anticoagulant, and antiviral properties. TQ use may thus be expected to improve COVID-19 comorbidities and to protect against certain antiviral drug-induced side effects and toxicities. TQ appears to be a promising therapeutic option for managing COVID-19 and its complications, and clinical trials in COVID-19 patients to examine the beneficial effects of TQ are thus highly recommended.

                            A randomised-controlled trial that is awaiting peer review suggests that Covid-19 patients who received a combination of honey and Nigella sativa recovered more quickly than those given a placebo. Treatment with honey and Nigella sativa (also known as black cumin) was found to alleviate Covid-19 symptoms within six days, compared to 13 days in the control group.In addition, subjects on the honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) treatment achieved a negative PCR test - used to diagnose Covid-19 - about four days earlier than subjects without the treatment.According to the researchers, this is the first such trial studying a combination of HNS in Covid-19 patients.The paper is published on the preprint server, medRxiv and has not yet been peer-reviewed yet.Dr Sohaib Ashraf, who is the principal investigator of this study, and a research fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA told NutraIngredients-Asia​: “When COVID-19 struck in late March, soon it was clear to us that this disease is going to cause havoc across the globe and will act as a reset button for world economy​.So, we ​searched for clinical trials published regarding proven efficacy of any drug against COVID-19 but unfortunately, we identified no drug proven effective against COVID-19. ​“We searched on scientific literature for any miracle drug that can be globally accessible with wide range efficacy against viruses and other microbes along with anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, anti-coagulant properties and wide range of safety profile. In that search, we found honey and Nigella sativa were a perfect fit.”​Researchers said both honey and Nigella sativa show similar pharmacological profiles with its anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory effects especially in upper respiratory tract infections.“We reasoned that the combination could be more effective in attenuating severity of the disease, controlling viral replication and curing COVID-19 patients​,” they wrote.Study design​The trial was conducted between May to July 2020 as an urgent study during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan.In total, 313 patients were enrolled in the RCT, and recruited from four medical care facilities in Lahore, Pakistan.210 subjects were categorised as moderate cases, identified by cough, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath, while 103 subjects were severe cases, identified by fever, cough, pneumonia, and respiratory distress.The subjects were randomised into the treatment or placebo group.In the treatment group, subjects were given honey (1g/kg/day) and Nigella sativa (80mg/kg/day) for up to 13 days.These were given two to three times a day depending on the patient’s comfort. Honey was dissolved in 250mL of warm water, while Nigella sativa was provided in capsules.Both honey and Nigella sativa were provided by Smile Welfare Organization, a non-profitable organisation based in Pakistan.The control group received empty capsules.In addition, all Covid-19 patients received standard care therapy as advised by the physician, comprising of anti-pyretic drugs, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation if required.Subjects were assessed for clinical symptoms daily for 13 days, and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests if found to remain asymptomatic for at least 48 hours.For patients who were discharged before day 13 or were home-quarantined, the follow-up was done by telemedicine.The primary outcomes were viral clearance (negative PCR test) and alleviation of symptoms.",Honey and black cumin seed,no,"

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.848676/full," Various combinations/concentrations of black seed oil and Thymoquinone were tested against SARS-CoV-2 MLV pseudovirus particles (pp) by assessing Luciferase activities measured with a Firefly Luciferase Assay Kit (CB- 80552-010, Codex BioSolutions Inc.). It was observed that Thymoquinone seemed to block viral infection. However, at high concentrations Thymoquinone caused cell death indicating cytotoxic effects. To confirm this result, cell growth assays were performed in the presence of Thymoquinone with Codex’s EnerCount cell growth assay kit which measures ATP levels inside the cells.Similarly, in a seropositive HIV infected patient treated with Thymoquinone (10 ml twice/day for 6 months), Onifade et al. (2013) demonstrated a decrease in viral load to an undetectable level within 3 months, an increase in CD4 count, relief of symptoms, and a sustained sero-reversion following COVID-19 therapy. Another investigation on a seropositive HIV-infected woman who received Thymoquinone (Nigella sativa) and honey treatment (10 ml thrice/day for 1 year) demonstrated prolonged sero-reversion, which the author attributed to Thymoquinone’s possible virucidal effect (Onifade et al., 2015).Akhtar and Riffat (1991) demonstrated the efficacy of a single oral administration of Thymoquinone (Nigella sativa) as powdered seeds and ethanolic extract (40 mg/kg body weight) in reducing the percentage of fecal eggs per Gram in children who were infected with cestodes.In a study conducted on Hepatitis C (HCV) patients, Abdel-Moneim et al.",therapy,neutral,"

Black cumin, when prescribed for prophylactic purposes, will prevent symptomatic COVID-19 from developing. Just to be clear: A number of clinical trials have confirmed that black seed does help with COVID-19. Another question is how reliable these studies are. Again, there is no consensus on the pharmaceutical purity of black cumin seeds and oil.

Can black seed oil treat COVID-19?,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/11/instagram-posts/theres-no-scientific-evidence-support-these-supple/," Black seed oil
People selling black seed oil — extracted from Nigella sativa, or black cumin seeds — as a COVID-19 treatment have also come under federal scrutiny. In a May warning letter to a company encouraging consumers to fight the coronavirus with black seed oil, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote that no reliable scientific evidence supported claims that black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19. The FDA has sent similar warning letters to companies selling black seed oil to treat or prevent COVID-19 as recently as September. The Journal of Pharmacopuncture, which is focused in part on alternative medicines, published an article in June on Nigella sativa as a ""potential herb for COVID-19,"" but its conclusion was far from the claim in the Instagram post, saying that such a supplement ""may reduce the adverse effects of conventional medicines"" but that randomized controlled trials were needed to determine any benefits in treating COVID-19 patients. Our ruling
A post on Instagram discourages people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine and instead advocates for ""naturopathic solutions,"" including vitamins D and C, colloidal silver and black seed oil. While research into some supplements like vitamin D has seemed promising, subsequent studies have questioned whether it can protect against COVID-19.",black seed oil can prevent or treat COVID-19,yes,"

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is being used in conjunction with other medicines in a number of clinical trials for patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus). Results of one study show Covid-19 patients treated with oseltamivir had a significantly shorter stay in the hospital and significantly lower death rate compared to the control group. This study did have limitations, and the authors noted that more prospective studies need to be done to clarify the clinical benefit of oseltamivir with other antiviral and combination therapies.",Is Tamiflu used to treat COVID-19,neutral,"

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9054703/," Oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) is a neuraminidase inhibitor approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B ([7,8]).It can inhibit the spread of the influenza virus and reduce viral shedding in respiratory secretions in the human body [8], and is considered a therapeutic option in several clinical trials and studies, but the results remain controversial ([9,10]). More studies are required there to demonstrate the efficacy of antiviral drugs in the treatment of patients with Covid-19.In this study, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of Oseltamivir, by comparing two different combination therapeutic regimens, based on length of hospital stay, need for admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation and mortality rate.2. Material and methods2.1. Study designThis was a retrospective analysis of a single center, cohort study, performed between Feb 20, 2020, and April 20, 2020, in patients with Covid-19 infection, at (XXX), a center for pandemic Covid-19 infected patients, (XXX).This study including 285 confirmed, Covid-19 infected patients who were admitted to this hospital during two months and received two different therapeutic regimens according to the guidelines issued by Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (first edition(11), fifth edition(12).The first group including 120 inpatients between Feb 20, 2020 and March 15, 2020 who received Oseltamivir in addition with routine regimen (combination group) [11].The second group including 165 patients between March 20, 2020 and April 20, 2020 received routine regimen alone (control group) [12].2.2. Study populationThe confirmed Covid-19 infected in patients with mild to severe disease were enrolled in the study, according to their clinical symptoms with a positive diagnostic kit result (RT-PCR) or typical radiologic changes on chest computed tomography (CT) [13], with the approval of the specialist in this hospital for the diagnosis of Covid-19, and clinical requirement of hospitalization(11).The patient's medical information including demographic data, clinical features, the result of Covid-19 test (PCR), chest CT scans, comorbidities, and underling disease (hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular and kidney disease), the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the requirement of mechanical ventilation, the duration of hospitalization, their outcome, and mortality, extracted from hospital documented patient's data recorded in this hospital.Patients with a history of allergic reactions or known contraindications (QT-prolongation) or drug interactions with routine regimens, or lack of data in their documents, and the patients who die within the first 24 h of hospitalization, exclude from study.The patients in this study were enrolled by simple random sampling without stratification.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the (XXX).Written informed consent was obtained from all patients when admitted to the hospital. patients’ confidentiality was considered by protecting their data and documents.2.3.",It can inhibit the spread of the influenza virus,neutral,"

While vaccines have dominated the landscape in the fight against COVID-19, oral antiviral pills that can be taken as an outpatient, with the goal of forestalling serious illness, are also in the works. This so-called ""Tamiflu approach"" to treating COVID-19 offers several advantages over current therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, which require intravenous infusions. An oral treatment for COVID-19 could be easily produced, transported, and stored, making it easier to obtain and take quickly. As with Tamiflu, the sooner one takes an antiviral, the lower the chances of developing serious illness, according to Joan Butterton, MD, vice president of clinical research in infectious disease at Merck in Boston. ""One of the real things for controlling the pandemic is making sure that drugs can get to the people who need them,"" Butterton told MedPage Today.

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/covid19/oseltamivir-decreases-hospitalization-length-and-mortality-for-covid-19/," Researchers assessed the effects of oseltamavir treatment among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Oseltamivir treatment was associated with a decreased rate of mortality and a shorter length of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 infection, according to findings published in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center between February and April 2020 and included 285 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients were assigned to 2 treatment groups on the basis of hospital admission date. Patients in group 1 (n=120) received oseltamivir plus standard care and those in group 2 (n=165; controls) received standard care with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The primary endpoints were length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit admission (ICU) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality.",decreased rate of mortality and a shorter length of hospitalization,neutral,"

Drug treatments for at risk adults with covid-19 who do not require oxygen: National Clinical Evidence Taskforce for COVID-19 Decision ToolRACGP Home-care guidelines for patients with COVID-19OseltamivirOseltamivir (Tamiflu®) can be used for treatment of people with suspected/confirmed influenza, or for prophylactic use in exposed people (primarily during influenza outbreaks in facilities and in people at high risk of severe disease). Treatment with oseltamivir may shorten the duration and severity of disease in people that already have influenza. Empiric treatment with anti-influenza medications should be considered for anyone presenting with moderate or severe disease, and for those presenting with mild disease and who are at risk of severe disease (based on clinical judgment).Clinical judgment should be on the basis of the patient’s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms when making antiviral treatment decisions for residents at increased risk of severe disease.Because the dose of oseltamivir may need to be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment, GPs should be aware of the person’s current renal function.When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after disease onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset.When influenza is confirmed in a facility, decisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza in every resident. If an influenza outbreak is confirmed in a residential care facility, your local public health unit will provide advice about which residents should receive oseltamivir as prophylaxis. Oseltamivir for prophylaxis is given once a day for 10 days and should be commenced as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) of outbreak recognition.Resources for the use of oseltamivirTamiflu ® (oseltamivir phosphate) Australian product information

Can Tamiflu help COVID-19?,https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-739774," Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of oseltamivir against COVID-19. METHODS: Swiss-model was used to construct the structure of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NRBD) of the nucleoprotein (NC), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). TM-align program was performed to compare the structure of the viral proteins with the structure of the neuraminidase of influenza A. Molecular docking was used to analyze the theoretical possibility of effective binding of oseltamivir with the active centers of the viral proteins. In vitro study was used to evaluate the antiviral efficiency of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2.

For instance, nimbolide isolated from Neem at 5 and 20 mg/kg significantly reduced the growth of colorectal cancer xenografts in mice. Xenografts are tissues that are transplanted from one species to another. Moreover, a significant decreased in tumorigenic protein, such as those related to proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, were also reported in the mice xenograft treated with nimbolide [39].An ethosomal formulation with soy lecithin (300 mg), ethanol (35%), luliconazole (100 mg) and Neem extract was more effective against Candida parapsilosis than Aspergillus niger in fungal culture tubes.

Studies have shown that long-term alcohol abuse and acute binge drinking are associated with immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral infections (19, 20). Therefore, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. However, in our dataset, only a few participants reported heavy alcohol consumption, which may be reflective of the healthier nature of study participants. The potential association of heavy alcohol consumption with COVID-19 and associated mortality should be further explored in a larger sample sized cohort (although ascertaining the prospective effect of heavy alcohol consumption would be challenging because heavy drinkers would be unlikely to volunteer for such studies).

Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/drinking-alcohol-covid-omicron-variant-22563514," Scientists from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have released a report busting myths around alcohol and Covid-19. They explored how drinking alcohol and how it could actually increase your chances of suffering from acute, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - one of the most severe complications of the virus. For more coronavirus news and stories, click here. The study states alcohol has a 'deleterious effect' on your immune system and will not stimulate immunity and virus resistance. In fact, drinking could make your immune system worse at fighting the virus, the WHO says. (Stock image) People having a drink outside a restaurant

Hurting Your Immune System
Chronic alcohol consumption poses significant risks during COVID-19, potentially making people more vulnerable to disease, Murtagh-Schaffer says. “Alcohol can impair the body’s immune system, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and impair sleep, which is critical to maintaining the immune system. Also, people with substance use disorders are more likely to develop  COVID-19 and experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, according to the research.”

Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://socalsunrise.com/alcohol-and-the-immune-system-during-covid-19/," So let’s take a look at what excessive alcohol consumption does to make you more susceptible to COVID-19. Part 1: Drinking Alcohol and the Immune System
 




Alcohol is known to cause inflammation in the body, leading to an immune deficiency. Drinking alcohol to excess weakens your immune system and makes you more prone to COVID-19, and it also lengthens its duration. Drinking alcohol in excess may also cause stomach problems, liver damage, pancreatitis, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, and stroke due to blood flow loss and low blood pressure.Your immune system’s job is to help your body determine which cells are healthy or unhealthy. Your immune system protects you from harmful threats such as viruses and bacteria. It consists of several different types of white blood cells and proteins and some other components that protect you from harmful infections, such as COVID-19.It also helps to fight cancerous tumors and helps to prevent an overgrowth of scar tissue in wounds.",weakens your immune system,neutral,"

"
Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.drinkiq.com/en-gb/drinking-and-your-body/does-drinking-alcohol-increase-the-chance-of-covid-19-infection/," There is currently no evidence to suggest that drinking alcohol by itself raises the risk of COVID-19 infection, provided people are complying with safety recommendations. When people drink excessively and become intoxicated, their inhibitions may be lowered and they may engage in risky behaviours and be less likely to follow guidance around face coverings or comply with social distancing requirements (8, 9).How much you drink can affect your health and ability to fight off infectionFor most people, moderate drinking is compatible with a balanced lifestyle (10). Scientific research has shown moderate drinking isn’t likely to impair your immune response or your ability to fight off disease (6, 11). However, people who drink excessively, particularly over extended periods of time, may have a weaker immune system (13-15) than those who don’t drink at all or do so moderately. Some studies have suggested that the immune response may be lower even immediately following an episode of excessive or binge drinking (16, 17). Experience with other infectious diseases also suggests that extended heavy drinking may interfere with the effectiveness of treatment (13, 15, 17-19).Based on clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people in over 150 testing sites around the world, there is currently no evidence that moderate drinking diminishes the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine.",There is currently no evidence to suggest that drinking alcohol by itself raises the risk,neutral,"

Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.Alcohol has been flying off the shelves as people try to combat boredom during lockdown, with some reports estimating that alcoholic beverage sales surged by 55 percent toward the end of March. The spike in alcohol sales has alarmed health experts and officials around the world, who are concerned that increased drinking could make people even more vulnerable to the respiratory disease.The U.S. surgeon general warned at-risk adults to refrain from drinking. Soon after, the World Health Organization (WHO) also suggested that people cut back on drinking, since alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19. “Alcohol consumption is associated with a range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and mental health disorders, which can make a person more vulnerable to COVID-19. In particular, alcohol compromises the body’s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes,” the WHO stated.Though there’s still limited data on the link between alcohol and COVID-19, past evidence shows alcohol consumption can worsen the outcomes from other respiratory illnesses by damaging the lungs and gut, and impairing the cells responsible for immune function.",alcohol can increase the risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19,yes,"

Can drinking alcohol worsen COVID-19?,https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/alcohol-consumption-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-projected-to-cause-more-liver-disease-and-deaths," BOSTON – Alcohol sales and consumption increased during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the effect of the increase in consumption on population health is not fully understood. In new research published in Hepatology, a team led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) projected rates of liver disease and associated deaths due to increased alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from a national survey of U.S. adults on their drinking habits that found that excessive drinking (such as binge drinking) increased by 21% during the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientists simulated the drinking trajectories and liver disease trends in all U.S. adults. They estimated that a one-year increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic will result in 8,000 additional deaths from alcohol-related liver disease, 18,700 cases of liver failure, and 1,000 cases of liver cancer by 2040. In the short term, alcohol consumption changes due to COVID-19 are expected to cause 100 additional deaths and 2,800 additional cases of liver failure by 2023. The researchers noted that a sustained increase in alcohol consumption for more than one year could result in 19–35% additional mortality.",the effect of the increase in consumption on population health is not fully understood,neutral,"

While physical distancing and the use of face masks are well-known factors in preventing the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds. A research team led by Assistant Professor Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted. They found that warmer temperatures (above 20° Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role. The study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.",SARS-CoV-2,neutral,"

"
Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238339," Although higher humidity may increase the atmospheric suspended matter [22], the amount of virus deposited on surfaces, and virus survival time in droplets on surfaces [44], the reduction of the virus spread by indirect air transmission may be an important factor behind the reduced spreading of COVID-19 in a humid climate. High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39]. The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47]. Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48]. Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35]. Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection.",High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract,neutral,"

Op-ed: Humidity can aid in the fight against COVID-19 

Maintaining relative humidity in the 40%-60% range in indoor spaces could help slow the spread of the coronavirus this winter, according to a November 18, 2020 Washington Post opinion piece co-authored by Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science and director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The authors explained that humidity can affect virus transmission in three ways. Studies suggest that higher humidity can enhance the body’s ability to fight off infection; that the coronavirus decays faster at close to 60% relative humidity than at other levels; and that drier air can lead to greater numbers of tiny coronavirus particles that travel farther and penetrate deeper into the lungs.",Humidity,neutral,"

Our results showed that the COVID-19 cases were influenced by temperature when the humidity was low, and that cases increased in dry and warm conditions. We drew an interactive graph of the influence of temperature and humidity on COVID-19. It showed that when the humidity exceeds about 70%, the effect of temperature on COVID-19 disappears, and the high humidity may inhibit the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant.

Bottom Line
Some of the variations in COVID-19 transmission between cities worldwide can be explained by higher temperature and humidity being associated with lower transmission rates. Evidence Summary
69,498 cases in China and 740,843 in the USA were included in the analysis. A 1°C increase in temperature was associated with a reduction in R of 0.023 (95% CI [-0.0395 to -0.0125) in China and 0.020 (95% CI -0.0311 to -0.0096) in the US. A 1% relative humidity rise was associated with a reduction in RE by 0.0078 (95% CI -0.011 to -0.0045) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI -0.015 to -0.0010) in the US. After the lockdowns in China and the US, temperature and relative humidity were still associated with changes in transmission but appeared to have a lower impact. A one thousand people per square kilometre rise in population density was associated with a 0.12 (95% CI [0.057, 0.18]) increase in the R-value before lockdown.",High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of COVID-19,yes,"

Warmer temperatures lessen COVID-19 spread, but control measures still needed

				by 
					Hayley Dunning

					09 June 2021
				

















New research shows transmission of the virus behind COVID-19 varies seasonally, but warmer conditions are not enough to prevent transmission. The study, led by Imperial College London researchers and published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to incorporate environmental data into epidemiological models of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. While people remain unvaccinated, governments mustn’t drop policies like lockdowns and social distancing just because a seasonal change means the weather is warming up. Dr Tom Smith
The team show that temperature and population density are the most important factors determining how easily the virus spreads, but only in the absence of mobility-restricting measures, such as lockdowns. First author of the study Dr Tom Smith, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “Our results show that temperature changes have a much smaller effect on transmission than policy interventions, so while people remain unvaccinated, governments mustn’t drop policies like lockdowns and social distancing just because a seasonal change means the weather is warming up. “However, our work also suggests that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to the virus spreading more easily in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes.”

WHO and WMO have a joint Office on Climate and Health office which seeks to accelerate access and application of weather and climate services for public health. Focus areas include climate change and extreme weather – in particular heatwaves – and air quality. The global and local spreading of COVID-19 is strongly determined by trade, travel, personal behaviour and hygiene, policies of social distancing. Several research teams are investigating the correlation between environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and UV radiation, and the number of cases of COVID-19.

A team of researchers unveiled the results of a new study last week that looked at how temperature and humidity may affect the transmission of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. According to the researchers' findings, “High temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.” An increase of just one degree Celsius and 1% relative humidity increase substantially lower the virus’s transmission, according to the data analyzed by the researchers. The study is the latest in a limited but growing body of research, not all of which has been peer-reviewed, that examines the effect of weather on the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 illness.

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200323-coronavirus-will-hot-weather-kill-covid-19," The higher the temperature and humidity, the shorter the virus survived. “Climate comes into play because it affects the stability of the virus outside the human body when expelled by coughing or sneezing, for example,” says Miguel Araújo, who studies the effects of environmental change on biodiversity at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, Spain. “The greater the time the virus remains stable in the environment, the greater its capacity to infect other people and become epidemic. While Sars-Cov-2 has quickly spread all over the world, the major outbreaks have mainly occurred in places exposed to cool and dry weather.”A recent analysis suggests that this pandemic coronavirus will be less sensitive to the weather than many hopeHis computer models certainly seem to match the pattern of outbreaks around the world, with the highest number of cases outside of the tropics. Araújo believes that if Covid-19 shares a similar sensitivity to temperature and humidity, it could mean cases of coronavirus will flare up at different times around the world. “It is reasonable to expect the two viruses will share similar behaviour,” he says.",the shorter the virus survived,neutral,"

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.unicef.org/montenegro/en/stories/higher-temperatures-affect-survival-new-coronavirus," This information was published by several web portals across the region – Krstarica, Srbininfo, and Glas javnosti. The article was also shared on their social media pages, which led to an increase in the number of people reached by this information. UNICEF volunteers - young reporters consulted the official website of the World Health Organization (WHO) to verify this claim:

“From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of the climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to, an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently washing your hands. By doing this, you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth or nose.""",the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas,no,"

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0865," Critically, this result is consistent across all three regions. Thus, intermediate indoor RH is associated with epidemic deceleration and decreased mortality, while extreme indoor humidity (either low RH or high RH) is associated with epidemic acceleration and increased mortality. The collapse of the regionally variable results into a single trend suggests that intermediate indoor RH could potentially reduce the spread and severity of COVID-19 disease.2.5. Assessing robustness and sensitivity to other factorsSince previous reports have focused on outdoor weather variables, it was important to test whether the results of our study held after controlling for differences in external weather conditions. Here, we stratified the global dataset by outdoor RH, temperature, outdoor absolute humidity (AH) or outdoor ultraviolet radiation (UV). The global dataset was partitioned into upper and lower halves using the median value of a given outdoor weather variable, and a series of common odds ratios were calculated for indoor RH exposure for each stratum.",intermediate indoor RH could potentially reduce the spread and severity,neutral,"

Can high temperatures and humidity prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87692-z," On April 7, 2020, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that “although experimental studies show a relationship between higher temperatures and humidity levels, and reduced survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory, there are many other factors besides environmental temperature, humidity, and survival of the virus outside of the host that influence and determine transmission rates among humans in the ‘real world’… with natural history studies, the conditions are relevant and reflect the real-world, but there is typically little control of environmental conditions and there are many confounding factors”4.Between May and November 2020, the European Respiratory Society published several articles discussing the hypothesis that temperature and the spread of COVID-19 are inversely related. Using data from 224 cities in China, one article published in May found no such association6. In August 2020, another analysis using data from China implied a non-linear relationship to the extent that temperature and COVID-19 are not associated below 7 ℃ but that a weak negative association exists above that threshold7. Yet another study published in November found a significant negative association between temperature and the spread of COVID-19 using global data8. While, in general, the evidence is mixed and the debate is still ongoing, laboratory studies found that SARS-CoV-2 is highly susceptible to heat and UV-radiation9,10,11,12,13,14.To add evidence from a different perspective, we use global data to examine the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19 controlling for several important confounding factors.

An international study with the participation of the Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, IrsiCaixa and the Infectious Diseases Service of the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital has shown that intravenous administration of the antiviral drug Remdesivir during the 3 days right after diagnosis of COVID-19 reduces the risk of hospitalization by 87% in people susceptible to severe disease. Administration of this drug has also decreased the number of disease-related medical visits by 81% (see table). Disease-related adverse events have been reduced from 7.1% in patients who did not receive treatment to 3.6% in patients who did receive the antiviral drug. A total of 562 unvaccinated individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 for different reasons, such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, participated in the study.",high risk of severe COVID-19,neutral,"

WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients

20 November 2020
















WHO has updated its recommendation on remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.On 22 April 2022, following publication of new data from a clinical trial looking at the outcome of admission to hospital, WHO now suggests the use of remdesivir in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization. Latest information on COVID-19 therapeutics.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.This recommendation, released on 20 November, is part of a living guideline on clinical care for COVID-19. It was developed by an international guideline development group, which includes 28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners and one ethicist. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support. The guidelines are an innovation, matching scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic.",there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes,neutral,"

Martin Landray of the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the world's largest study of various COVID-19 treatments, says remdesivir ""definitely doesn't work in the sickest patients where the biggest gains would be"" but might help people at earlier stages of disease. Further complicating the matter, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 recover without any intervention. ""The argument that the earlier you use it the better is great until you realize what the implications of that are: You won't save many lives, and you'll have to treat a lot of patients,"" Landray says. ""It's very inconvenient, and it'll cost you a fortune."" Questions have also arisen about the potential of remdesivir to do harm.",might help people at earlier stages of disease,neutral,"

Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 

In this recently published Cochrane review, authors explored the effects of treating COVID-19 with remdesivir, an antiviral medication. First author Kelly Ansems said ""Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening."" Key messages
For adults hospitalised with COVID-19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care. The review authors are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID-19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas.",whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition,neutral,"

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading in the body.It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.You will usually be given remdesivir through a drip in your arm (infusion).You'll need to have the treatment as soon as possible after you have tested positive for COVID-19 and within 7 days of your symptoms starting.You'll be given remdesivir in a hospital or at a local centre.You will only be eligible to have the medicine if you are in the highest risk group.If you are in the highest risk group you may be sent a letter and a lateral flow test that you can do at home should you develop symptoms of COVID-19. You must report your COVID-19 lateral flow test result on GOV.UK.If you test positive for COVID-19, are eligible and have reported the result, you will be contacted by the NHS. This will usually be by text, email or phone.If you have not been contacted within 24 hours of your positive test, but think you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call your GP surgery, specialist or 111. They can make an urgent referral if needed.You will then be assessed (over the phone) to see if remdesivir is right for you. If it's suitable, they'll tell you where to get your treatment, how to get there and how to return home safely. This will usually be by text, email or phone.",It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection,neutral,"

Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/study-supports-use-of-remdesivir-for-covid-19-patients-on-low-flow-oxygen-or-no-oxygen," “Our findings support the routine use of remdesivir in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19,” says study lead author Brian Garibaldi, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “We observed that remdesivir is best used as early as possible, before the patient progresses to requiring high levels of oxygen or intubation and mechanical ventilation. Most patients who need that kind of advanced respiratory support are likely past the point where antiviral therapies like remdesivir would be effective.”
There have been several previous studies on remdesivir’s effectiveness in treating COVID-19 infection, and the results have often conflicted. However, the authors of this study have great confidence in their conclusions due to the diversity of the patients evaluated and the fact that this is one of the largest retrospective studies of remdesivir to date. “This is an important, real-world study that shows remdesivir does work in many cases,” says Garibaldi. “Our findings are particularly important as we battle a surge of delta and omicron cases.",remdesivir is best used as early as possible,neutral,"

Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-07004-8," The data collection instrument did not allow to collect information regarding the severity of disease and therefore it is most likely that majority of these patients were moderate or severe. Data was collected at a single time point. However, our analysis presents findings of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir in real-life clinical settings in India and adds to the clinical evidence on remdesivir use in COVID-19.ConclusionThe retrospective analysis of data from an active surveillance programme of remdesivir therapy in patients with COVID-19 showed that remdesivir was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. The clinical outcome of cure and improvement rate was 84%, with greater improvement in patients with age < 60 years and receiving standard low-flow oxygen and mortality rate was 6.77%.

Can remdesivir cure COVID-19?,https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-treatment-drugs," The antiviral treatment remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, was the first COVID-19 therapy to get full FDA approval, and, so far, it's still the only one. Although originally used in COVID-19 patients only after they were hospitalized, new data suggests it can be helpful in outpatients who become infected and who are at high risk for severe disease. It is meant for people who have a current COVID-19 infection.When it was authorized: Full approval was granted in October 2020. (It was first authorized in May 2020 for critically ill patients who were being treated with oxygen for COVID-19.) The authorization was later expanded to include other groups, and it was authorized to treat non-hospitalized patients in January 2022.
Who can get it: Fully approved for children and adults who are at high risk for severe disease.

For Immediate Release:
January 21, 2022





Español
Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took two actions to expand the use of the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) to certain non-hospitalized adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease. This provides another treatment option to reduce the risk of hospitalization in high-risk patients. Previously, the use of Veklury was limited to patients requiring hospitalization. “On the heels of the FDA’s recent authorization of two oral antiviral drugs, today’s actions bolster the arsenal of therapeutics to treat COVID-19 and respond to the surge of the omicron variant,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Today’s actions provide adults and pediatric patients, with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19, with a treatment option they could receive outside of a traditional inpatient hospital setting, including at skilled nursing facilities, home healthcare settings and outpatient facilities such as infusion centers.” 
Veklury is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended.","

Can turmeric treat COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502749/," Time alone has hitherto proven most effective in their restoration, but turmeric, long believed by some to have medicinal properties, may be a swifter and surer alleviator of anosmia and ageusia. This case series reports the speedy and consequential restoration of taste and smell in two subjects infected with COVID-19 following ingestion of one 1000 mg dose of a turmeric supplement. In view of this, we propose that turmeric be considered in the treatment of anosmia and ageusia caused by COVID-19 infection.Keywords: curcumin, covid-19, coronavirus, sars-cov-2, anosmia, ageusia, hyposmia, dysgeusia, turmericIntroductionAnosmia and ageusia are common and often comorbid symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The frequency of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in infected individuals has been reported to be 19.4-88% [1]. While most of those infected recover smell and taste, up to 20% experience persistent anosmia or hyposmia and ageusia or dysgeusia after 30 days [2].The mechanisms by which COVID-19 causes anosmia and ageusia are unknown; they may be similar to those of other coronaviruses. Upper respiratory viruses are known to cause nasal mucosal swelling and olfactory cleft conductive blockade [3].",turmeric be considered in the treatment of anosmia and ageusia,no,"

Background
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2, continues to increase morbidity and mortality across the world. Mitigation strategies and vaccinations have declined the infection rate and severity; however, there are limited therapeutic options that are currently available for treating COVID-19. Traditional herbal medicines are a promising option for the complementary treatment of COVID-19. The rhizome of Curcuma longa, which is more commonly known as turmeric root, is one popular option that is associated with potent antiviral properties.",there are limited therapeutic options that are currently available for treating COVID-19,neutral,"

Can turmeric treat COVID-19?,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/2/256," ConclusionsThis review identified six studies that showed that adjunct treatment with different formulations of curcumin led to reductions in typical symptoms, duration of hospitalization, and deaths in COVID-19 patients with different levels of disease severity. At the same time, the curcumin treatment led to the amelioration of cytokine storm manifestation by reducing pro-inflammatory factors and stimulating anti-inflammatory pathways. Thus, these findings suggest that curcumin treatment may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms by restoration of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance. Furthermore, the study by Pawar et al. showed that curcumin-piperine supplementation led to fewer thromboembolic episodes following recovery from COVID-19 infections [39]. Considering that dose-escalating studies have demonstrated the safety of curcumin administration for up to three months [65], we suggest that treatment with this natural compound as a supplement should be evaluated both during and after hospitalization and in the post-vaccination stages to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.",alleviate COVID-19 symptoms,neutral,"

Can turmeric treat COVID-19?,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/stormbreaker-how-turmeric-can-be-of-value-in-situations-like-covid-19-pandemic-79731," In case of an acute infection, the inflammatory reaction can even damage body’s own healthy tissues and organs — a condition known as cytokine storm. Ajaikumar Kunnumakkara, professor at the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, evaluated the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. The search showed numerous cases that have reported the potency of spices, including turmeric, to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation. They are cheap and relatively safe to consume and their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, he reports in Life Sciences published on January 30, 2021. The reason curcumin, and by association turmeric, has not been used as an allopathic drug is because the substance’s poor bioavailability (duration of its presence in the blood). Kunnumakkara feels that the issue of bioavailability can be easily remedied by using a combination of methods.",their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm,neutral,"

Curcumin, as an active constituent of Curcuma longa (turmeric), has been studied in several experimental and clinical trial studies. Curcumin has some useful clinical effects such as antiviral, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antifatigue effects that could be effective to manage the symptoms of the infected patient with COVID-19. It has several molecular mechanisms including antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic properties with inhibitory effects on Toll-like receptors, NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and bradykinin. Scientific evidence suggests that curcumin could have a potential role to treat COVID-19. Thus, the use of curcumin in the clinical trial, as a new treatment option, should be considered.",Curcuma longa,neutral,"

Can turmeric treat COVID-19?,https://www.nutraingredients-asia.com/Article/2022/07/06/curcumin-supplement-could-reduce-weakness-in-covid-19-patients-rct," The findings were highlighted in an RCT titled “The efficacy of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation on clinical symptoms, duration, severity, and inflammatory factors in COVID-19 outpatients: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial” ​published in BioMed Central.“In animal models, curcumin supplementation was shown to modulate inflammatory response and reduce respiratory distress. Curcumin could bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, thus, may have potential antiviral effects.​“The proven anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin could prevent cytokine storms, and the molecule may also be effective in alleviating the coagulation abnormalities observed in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, curcumin’s immunomodulatory, anti-microbial, antiviral properties, and beneficial effects of curcumin on pneumonia are evidenced,”​ said the researchers.Hence, this RCT aimed to evaluate the effect of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation on clinical symptoms, duration, severity, and inflammatory factors in outpatients with COVID-19.A total of 46 patients aged 18 to 65 years and afflicted with COVID-19 were recruited from the Motamed health centre, affiliated with the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, from November 2020 to April 2021.Subjects were randomly allocated to consume two capsules of curcumin-piperine or a placebo over 14 days. Each curcumin capsule contains 500mg curcumin with 5mg piperine.Findings​The most significant outcome was that 10 patients (83.3%) in the curcumin group and five patients (38.5%) in the placebo group recovered from weakness. This improvement was significantly greater in the curcumin group than in the placebo group.Otherwise, recovery for symptoms like dry cough, sputum cough, sore throat, muscular pain, headaches and dyspnea showed no significant difference between the two groups.However, these findings contradicted results from recent studies, which showed most clinical symptoms like muscle fatigue, cough and chills were significantly reduced. The team postulated that it could be due to the type and dosage.Nonetheless, the study demonstrated a significant reduction in weakness and tiredness in patients supplemented with curcumin, suggesting its immense benefits when facing long COVID-19 disease.Excessive tiredness has been a major complaint by COVID-19 patients and often remains for a long time, possibly causing disability, poor quality of life, pain, memory impairment and sleep abnormalities.",the molecule may also be effective in alleviating the coagulation abnormalities,neutral,"

Understanding Turmeric & Echinacea COVID-19 Warnings
Some experts are now warning that several natural medicines, includingÂ turmeric,Â echinacea,Â licorice, and others might interfere with the bodyâs immune and inflammatory response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Make sure patients understand these warnings. Turmeric, echinacea, and licorice have anti-inflammatory properties similar to NSAIDs. Several months ago, Franceâs health minister claimed that taking NSAIDs might increase the risk of severe COVID-19. But currently there isnât any strong evidence supporting this claim â experts still believe that NSAIDs can be considered for use in patients with COVID-19, just as they would be for any other fever or infection. This new warning about natural medicines is also coming out of France, for similar reasons to the NSAIDs warning.",coronavirus disease 2019,neutral,"

The CUR-QUE treatment group were required to take a soft capsule of 168mg of curcumin and 260mg of quercetin twice daily for 14 days. Both groups received SOC medications including paracetamol, oral azithromycin, oral prednisolone, with or without  ceftriaxone.At the seven day follow up, it was established that 45% more patients in the CUR-QUE group were clear of the COVID inflection, suggesting they were able to clear the virus significantly faster than the control group. It was established that by day 14, all remaining patients in both groups were clear of the virus, highlighting the delayed recovery time of those within this group.In addition, it was observed that the acute symptoms initially observed had cleared in 40% of the CUR-QUE treated group at day seven, when compared to 16% of the control group.With regards to the assessed laboratory biochemistry of the patients, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers were not observed to be significantly different between the two groups.Polyphenol potential​The study results suggest that the combined intakes of CUR-QUE may have therapeutic potential for treating the COVID-19 virus in patients at an early stage.“It is speculated that the observed treatment benefits of CUR-QUE supplementation is possibly due to synergistic pharmacological effects of curcumin and quercetin.”, ​the researchers explain, suggesting that the combination may interfere with the replication of the main protease (Mpro) involved the virus’ replication.They add that the polyphenols have also been observed to exhibit “direct binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) RBD”, ​which may prevent viral entry to host cells, the scientists hypothesise.Whilst the results mirror previous study findings, there is a need for future study utilising larger sample sizes, as well as placebo-controls and double-blind trials to further validate the observations.

Their results indicated that the turmeric spice can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins and can be used as a therapeutic or protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting key proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to computational modeling and simulations studies by Saadat et al. (2020) the interaction and stability of the docked keto and enol forms of curcumin with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were verified by molecular dynamics simulations, free energy binding, and interaction energy.

•Study shows lower SARS-CoV-2 mortality among physically active individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa
A recent study published in the journal Computers in Biology and Medicine demonstrated that the phytochemical curcumin is a potent therapeutic prospect against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 508 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and six million deaths to date globally. As of now, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is the dominant strain worldwide. Omicron was designated a variant of concern (VOC) since it can evade vaccine- and infection-induced immunity due to several mutations in its spike (S) protein, including 15 amino acid substitutions across the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Recent studies indicate that many of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccinations offer little or no immunity against Omicron infection.",the phytochemical curcumin is a potent therapeutic prospect,neutral,"

Nevertheless, because some clinical studies show turmeric effectiveness in infectious disease prevention and treatment, further clinical and consumer analysis should be conducted to reach robust conclusion on the benefit of turmeric beneficial for COVID-19 treatment. The outcome of this paper demonstrates the health benefits of turmeric and its effectiveness in immune system enhancement and protection against infectious diseases. Keywords

Can a vegetarian diet prevent COVID-19?,https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2021/05/18/bmjnph-2021-000272," In a single-centre, cross-sectional study of 206 Iranian patients with COVID-19, those with higher fruit and poultry consumption and lower tea consumption were less likely to have severe COVID-19.17 Our findings were similar to this prior study in that participants who reported following plant-based diets or a spectrum of plant-based diets (plant-based diets or pescatarian diets) had a non-significant higher intake of fruits. However, in our study, participants who were following plant-based diets or pescatarian diets had higher consumption of other food groups (vegetables, legumes, nuts) and lower consumption of poultry. Such differences in results may be due to differences in dietary patterns among Iranian adults relative to our study population, and our focus on dietary patterns rather than intake of specific food groups.Plant-based diets or vegetarian diets are dietary patterns that are high in plant foods and low in animal products.12 13 Consistent with this definition, participants who reported that they followed plant-based diets or vegetarian diets had higher intake of plant foods (vegetables, legumes, nuts) and lower intake of poultry and red and processed meat. Plant-based diets are rich in nutrients, especially phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids),13 18 with prior studies reporting higher fibre, vitamins A, C, and E, folate, and mineral (iron, potassium, magnesium) intake among those with highest versus lowest adherence to plant-based diets.12 19 Studies have reported that supplementation of some of these nutrients, specifically, vitamins A, C, D, and E, decreased the risk of respiratory infections, such as the common cold and pneumonia, and shortened the duration of these illnesses.16 20–23 These nutrients are hypothesised to support the immune system as they play important roles in the production of antibodies, proliferation of lymphocytes, and reduction of oxidative stress.16 While previously, both specific micronutrient deficiencies as well as generalised malnutrition have been associated with immune dysfunction in the host, the viral pathogen itself may be affected by the nutritional deficiency as well.4 24 Multiple viruses, such as coxsackievirus and influenza, have been shown to develop increased virulence due to changes in their genomes as a consequence of replicating in a nutritionally deficient host (eg, deficiency in selenium).25 26 Selenium may be an important nutrient to consider, considering its role in immunity.16 27 Given our findings of protection from severe illness in those consuming a micronutrient-dense diet, our data support this hypothesis. We could not further explore individual nutrient levels in our study population because we did not have these data. Future studies with detailed information on plasma micronutrient levels are warranted to confirm our findings.Along with plant-based diets, individuals who reported following pescatarian diets had lower odds of severe COVID-19.",lower odds of severe COVID-19,neutral,"

Although metabolic conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes have been linked to an increased risk of COVID-19, as well as an increased risk of experiencing serious symptoms once infected, the impact of diet on these risks is unknown. In a recent study led by researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and published in Gut, people whose diets were based on healthy plant-based foods had lower risks on both counts.

AbstractIn the WHO European Region, more and more people are shifting towards plant-based diets for reasons relating to health, as well as to ethical considerations about climate change and animal welfare. In some countries changes in dietary patterns are only just emerging, while in others this trend is increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, the evidence on the long-term health impacts of vegetarian and vegan diets remains incomplete. This fact sheet aims to review the current evidence and highlight knowledge gaps in this area.","

Another study found that health care workers following a plant-based diet who had substantial exposure to COVID-19 patients had a 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Okinawa, Japan, one of the “Blue Zones” where people live long and healthy lives, is another real-world example the authors provide to show the benefits of a plant-based diet for COVID-19. Okinawa, where the diet is predominantly plant-based and rich in sweet potatoes, green leafy vegetables, and soy products, has a much lower COVID-19 mortality rate than Tokyo, which is similar in size but has a lower population density.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s been suggested that certain foods or diets may offer protection against COVID-19. But are these sorts of claims reliable? A recent study published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health sought to test this hypothesis. It found that health professionals who reported following diets that are vegetarian, vegan or pescatarian (those that exclude meat but include fish) had a lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Additionally, the study found that those who said they eat a low-carbohydrate or high-protein diet seemed to have an increased risk of contracting moderate-to-severe COVID-19. This may make it sound like certain food preferences – such as being vegetarian or a fish eater – may benefit you by reducing the risk of COVID-19.",lower risk of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19,neutral,"

Eating a plant rich diet reduces risk of developing COVID-19
People who eat a high quality, gut friendly diet are less likely to develop COVID-19 or become severely ill. Those eating poorer quality diets are more at risk, especially if they live in a more socioeconomically deprived area. The study, published in GUT, by researchers from King’s and Harvard Medical School, examines data from nearly 600,000 ZOE COVID Study app contributors. Participants completed a survey about the food they ate during Feb 2020 (pre-pandemic), making it the largest study in this space. 19% of these contributors contracted COVID-19. People with the highest quality diet were around 10% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those with the lowest quality diet, and 40% less likely to fall severely ill. This is the first longitudinal study of diet and COVID-19 and the first to show that a healthy diet cuts the chances of developing the disease in the first place.","People who eat a high quality, gut friendly diet",neutral,"

This could affect the accuracy of the results.In addition, the relatively small sample size meant that there were wide margins of error in the estimates of how much of an impact diet had on people’s risk of getting seriously ill. For instance, for people following a plant-based diet, the odds of becoming seriously ill were anywhere between 19 and 90% lower.The authors also found that when they adjusted for access to personal protective equipment (PPE), the results for the plant-based diet seemed to hold, but the plant- or fish-based diet stopped being statistically significant. Therefore, it is possible for the relationship between diet and severity of illness to be explained by other factors, such as PPE, that the researchers did not adjust for.Finally, the majority of the people in this study were white male Western doctors.

   A group of vegetarian activists argue that the COVID-19 Omicron variant is good reason for people to adopt a plant-based diet.Papers by members of the Physicians Committee have correlated giving up meat to reduced risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. The authors of the new editorial in European Journal of Clinical Nutrition cite data touting the benefits of a plant-based diet for COVID-19, like one observational paper which claimed that a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a 9% lower risk of COVID-19 infection and a 41% lower risk of severe COVID-19. Another exploratory paper claimed that health care workers following a plant-based diet who were exposed to COVID-19 patients had a 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe COVID-19.Confounders are numerous but they authoritatively note that Okinawa, Japan is a “Blue Zone” where people live longer and healthier lives because, the authors say, they are eat more sweet potatoes, soy, and green leafy vegetables. Okinawa has a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than Tokyo and they link that to less meat but there is no control because Okinawans are also more likely to be poorer than residents of Tokyo and so can't afford meat - the poverty rate is double that of the mainland. Because Okinawa is more poor, 30 percent live in poverty, COVID-19 mortality may be under-counted.",Activists Claim A Vegetarian Diet Will Prevent COVID-19 Deaths,neutral,"

In addition to obesity, nearly 60% of patients with COVID-19 have diabetes; those with diabetes have approximately an 8% increase in COVID-19-related death, according to Dr Rosenfeld. Nearly 20% of COVID patients have hypertension, which increases mortality by approximately 6% and increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19 by 66%. The key to reducing these risks is eating more whole grains, fruits, nuts, seeds, and legumes while reducing salt, said Dr Rosenfeld. Following a plant-based diet may be the best way to prevent or reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other chronic noninfectious diseases, he noted. To round out a healthy lifestyle, Dr Rosenfeld recommended getting 150 minutes per week of exercise, sleeping 7 to 9 hours per night, and reducing meat intake.",Following a plant-based diet,neutral,"

But ours is the first study to show that a higher quality diet actually reduces the chances of developing the disease in the first place.We still don’t know exactly how diet helps to cut the risk from COVID-19, but study co-lead, Professor Andrew Chan MD, MPH from Massachusetts General Hospital, and professor at Harvard Medical School, suspects that inflammation may be playing a role. He says, “Diet quality is an established risk factor for many conditions that are known to have an inflammatory basis. Our study demonstrates that this may also hold true for COVID-19, a virus which is known to provoke a severe inflammatory response.”Who could benefit most from eating a better quality diet?Importantly, we discovered that the impact of diet was amplified by individual life situations, with people living in low-income neighbourhoods and having the lowest quality diet being around 25% more at risk from COVID-19 than people in more affluent communities who were eating in the same way.Based on these results, we’ve calculated that nearly a quarter of COVID-19 cases could have been prevented if these differences in diet quality and wealth had not existed.Dr Sarah Berry, study co-lead and Reader in nutritional sciences at King’s College London, says, “For the first time we’ve been able to show that a healthier diet can cut the chances of catching COVID-19, especially for people living in more deprived areas. Access to healthier food is important to everyone in society, but our findings tell us that helping those living in poorer areas to eat more healthily could have the biggest public health benefits.”‍How can I improve my diet to help protect against COVID-19?Our findings clearly show that eating a plant-rich, ‘gut friendly’ diet is associated with a lower risk from COVID-19.

This Doctor Says a Vegan Diet May Boost COVID Immunity








World-renowned biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell says a vegan diet may help “minimize the severity” of coronavirus infection. The plant-based nutritional expert is well-known for completing one of the most comprehensive studies on human nutrition. Dr. Campbell—along with his son, Thomas M. Campbell— found dietary links between the consumption of animal-based foods like meat, dairy, and eggs and certain diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. The findings were based on studies conducted in the 1980s in 65 Chinese counties where plant-based diets were common. They were published in Dr. Campbell’s 2005 book, “The China Study.” The publication is now one of America’s best-selling nutrition books. Based on the findings, Dr. Campbell says a plant-based diet may spur the immune system into producing more antibodies.",coronavirus infection,neutral,"

The observation that influenza vaccines are linked to a reduction in not just SARS-CoV-2 infections, but also disease severity, strongly suggests that the protection is genuine, he adds.Time limitHow long this protection lasts is unclear. Among those in the Qatar study who had the flu jab and later contracted COVID-19, Abu-Raddad’s team recorded SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring, on average, about six weeks after vaccination. “I don’t expect to see this effect lasting long at all,” he says. Netea guesses that the benefits last for between six months and two years.It’s not fully clear why flu vaccines — which are composed of killed influenza viruses — would also protect against COVID-19. Vaccines train the immune system to recognize specific pathogens, but they also rev up broad-acting antiviral defences, says Netea, who has found signs of such responses in flu-vaccine recipients3.Netea’s team is also working to better quantify the benefits of vaccines targeting influenza and other diseases against COVID-19.",It’s not fully clear,neutral,"

While the world has celebrated the arrival of highly effective vaccines against COVID-19, new work by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Oxford shows that even unrelated vaccines could help reduce the burden of the pandemic. The study, published Jan. 10 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, crystallizes decades of evidence suggesting that the generalized immune-boosting properties of many vaccines can cross-protect patients against multiple pathogens.Before COVID-19-specific vaccines became available, many public health experts and immunologists suggested immunizing vulnerable populations with other vaccines to provide some degree of protection. ""We know that unrelated vaccines have these heterologous effects, and a reasonable person could tell you that if you used them during a pandemic, it would benefit,"" said Dr. Nathaniel Hupert, an associate professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine and lead author on the new paper. However, it wasn't clear how much such an intervention would help, which populations would be best to target or how much of the population would have to get the unrelated vaccines to have a meaningful effect.To address those questions, Dr. Hupert and senior author Dr. Douglas Nixon, a professor of immunology in medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine, and their colleagues from Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Oxford used the COVID-19 International Modeling Consortium (CoMo) system, a sophisticated computer modeling platform they'd built in response to the pandemic. ""If you have a model that can be customized to a particular place and time in the context of an outbreak, you can start to experiment with different conditions of population immunity and see how things might have played out,"" Dr. Hupert said.Using the winter 2020-21 COVID-19 wave that struck the United States after holiday season reopenings, the investigators modeled the likely effects of a non-COVID-19 vaccine intervention at different times and targeting different populations.",even unrelated vaccines could help reduce the burden of the pandemic,neutral,"

Their data also showed that, in this particular group of people with Covid-19, those who were on ACE inhibitors or ARBs seemed to be less likely to die or need to be transferred to a critical care unit. More recently, researchers carried out a meta-analysis study (where data from multiple studies in a particular area is combined to see overall trends) looking at data for 28,872 patients hospitalised with Covid-19.

ACE-Is/ARBs upregulates the human ACE2 receptor, which facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells.1–5 The initially published studies of ACE-I/ARB users and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported no increased risk or worsened outcome after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or a diagnosis of COVID-19.6–16 However, available studies are limited by incomplete data on recent ACE-I/ARB use and preexisting comorbidities,6 7 9 by restriction to hospitalised or hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 patients,9 10 12–15 or by incomplete follow-up.6 Other limitations have included immortal time bias from inclusion of in-hospital ACE-I/ARB use after COVID-19 diagnosis,10 11 15 16 which may lead to apparently beneficial effects, because ACE-I/ARBs would only be prescribed if patients are haemodynamically stable and have survived until drug initiation. Only few studies on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection included an active comparator.12 13
Major professional societies have called for further high-quality research and issued warnings against ACE-I/ARB discontinuation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,1 17 to avoid worsening of underlying cardiometabolic conditions.18
As ACE-Is/ARBs are widely used drugs, any association with rate of infection or adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an important public health impact. Thus, there is an urgent need to examine the hypotheses of increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsened outcome, among users of ACE-Is/ARBs.MethodsDesign and settingWe conducted this nationwide combined case-control and cohort study in Denmark (population ~5.8 million persons) to study the rate (case-control design) and the prognosis (cohort design) of SARS-CoV-2.

Although the pulmonary CT changes of patients in each group were not analyzed in this study, clinical prognosis suggested that the use of ACEI or ARB would not promote the secondary spread of the virus in the lungs of patients, or the possibility of secondary infection was low. Whether the use of ACEI or ARB can aggravate the pneumonia-induced damage in COVID-19 patients is a major point of contention in the use of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.Most studies investigating whether ARBs/ACEIs aggravate COVID-19 induced pneumonia have indicated that inhibition of the RAAS system upregulates the expression of ACE2 and alleviates viral pneumonia [14]. On both axes of the RAAS system, the consequence of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis causes hypertension and exacerbates lung injury, while it is counteracted by the ACE2/Ang 1–7/MasR axis [12, 13], protecting the lung function [25, 26]. The clinical examination of patients from Wuhan with COVID-19 induced pneumonia showed that IL-1b, IFN-, IL-10, and other inflammatory factors were significantly increased when patients were admitted to the hospital, and the expression level of G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, and TNF were upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients.

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/ace-inhibitors-arbs-and-covid-19-what-gps-need-to," A brief summary of salient points:

The COVID-19 virus enters cells via ACE-2 receptors on cells
Some doctors are now questioning the use of antihypertensives ACE-inhibitors and ARBs due to their effect on ACE-2, and thus potential effect on COVID-19
Leading experts warn that ARBs may amplify COVID-19 severity in patients
The role of ACE-inhibitors on COVID-19 is less clear
Experts warn that abruptly stopping ARBs (and ACE-inhibitors) for heart failure may lead to acute heart failure, and ceasing them for ACE-inhibitors may lead to unstable blood pressure
Peak international cardiology bodies strongly recommend patients stay on current antihypertensive therapies

Why are antihypertensives currently a concern for COVID-19? The issue surrounding ACE-inhibitors and ARBs stems from the fact the COVID-19 virus binds to the ACE-2 receptor, according to Associate Professor Nathan Better, cardiologist and deputy director of nuclear medicine at Royal Melbourne Hospital and private cardiologist at Cabrini Hospital. ‘[COVID-19] attaches to the cell’s surface via the ACE-2 protein –  that is its sole point of entry – and what we know is that ARBs … increase the expression of the ACE-2 protein in the body as many as three to five times,’ Associate Professor Better told newsGP. ‘It basically works to give the virus a portal to entry; that’s what is being quoted [in the research].’
 
According to Associate Professor Better, treatment with ARBs then ‘amplifies’ the effects of COVID-19. From a ‘basic science point of view’, he said, it seems patients on these antihypertensives may fare worse than average, and that they should cease these medications. ‘But this has not been shown in any clinical trials,’ Associate Professor Better said, keen to note he is not advising that patients cease their medications based on that.",amplify COVID-19 severity,neutral,"

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11845-022-03096-6," The effect of the use of ACEI and ARBs and the increase in ACE2 expression in the pathogenicity of the COVID-19 is not known. The virus may enter the cell due to increased ACE2 expression following the use of ACEI and ARBs. In addition, ACE2 converts vasoconstriction (by angiotensin 2) to vasodilation (by angiotensin 1–7) by converting angiotensin 2 to angiotensin 1–7. Some animal studies show that this vasodilation has an unspecified mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [18]. Despite the contradictory effects of ACEI and ARBs, there is no evidence to discontinue the routine use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients, and it is recommended to continue their routine usage [24,25,26].

The relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, and, by analogy, SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in the context of COVID-19, is highly complex. In fact, basic research suggests that ACE inhibitors, and ARBs in particular, have a protective role.In this context, thus, there is no basis for discontinuing existing treatments with ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Moreover, complications due to the indiscriminate discontinuation of these drugs could have far more serious consequences than many of the surmised adverse effects.

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/ace-inhibitors-arbs-do-not-worsen-covid-19-risk," A systematic review finds little evidence to back those fears.The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) does not appear to worsen the severity of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), according to new research.The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, also found that there is likely no connection between such medications and the chance of a symptomatic patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The results refute concerns by some that these medications might make patients more vulnerable amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Corresponding author Devan Kansagara, MD, MCR, of the Veterans Health Administration’s Portland Health Care System, explained in the study that early evidence from China showing hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with COVID-19, and that patients with those pre-existing conditions were experiencing more severe cases, led some experts to hypothesize that the 2 types of therapies might in some way be making people more susceptible to the disease.“The proposed mechanism by which ACEIs and ARBs may play a role in COVID-19 is through upregulation of the angiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is presumed to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells,” Kansagara and colleagues wrote.Still, they noted that investigators have not yet been able to consistently demonstrate such an upregulation. Furthermore, others have hypothesized that the drugs might actually help patients fight off the virus.In an attempt to get to the bottom of the question, the investigators pulled together existing literature from medical databases, including ClinicalTrials.gov, that involved patients taking ACEIs or ARBs and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates or COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The study is being structured as a living systematic review, with plans to continue ongoing surveillance for a year.Though about half of the studies were small and did not adjust for confounding variables, Kansagara and colleagues found consistent outcomes in the research. Two retrospective studies showed use of the therapies was not connected with a higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and a third case-control study found no link between the drugs and COVID-19 illness.Beyond that, the investigators located 14 observational studies, with more than 23,000 enrollees, that consistently failed to show a link between disease severity and the 2 medications.The group also found 4 registered randomized trials that are designed not to gauge ACEIs and ARBs as potential exacerbating factors in COVID-19, but rather to test them as possible therapies for the disease.Altogether, the Kansagara and colleagues said they have high certaining that the drugs are not associated with more severe disease, and moderate certainty that the drugs aren’t associated with higher rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in symptomatic patients.“On the basis of the findings from this rapidly expanding literature, no indication exists to prophylactically stop ACEI or ARB treatment because of concerns about COVID-19,” investigators concluded.",does not appear to worsen the severity,no,"

EMA advises continued use of medicines for hypertension, heart or kidney disease during COVID-19 pandemic








Press release 27/03/2020







EMA is aware of recent media reports and publications which question whether some medicines, for instance angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, or sartan medicines), could worsen coronavirus disease (COVID-19). ACE inhibitors and ARBs are most commonly used for treating patients with high blood pressure, heart failure or kidney disease.It is important that patients do not interrupt their treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and there is no need to switch to other medicines. There is currently no evidence from clinical or epidemiological studies that establishes a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the worsening of COVID-19. Experts in the treatment of heart and blood pressure disorders, including the European Society of Cardiology, have already issued statements along those lines.1  To gather more evidence, EMA is proactively reaching out to researchers working to generate further evidence in epidemiological studies.As the public health crisis rapidly extends across the globe, scientific research is ongoing to understand how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reproduces in the body, interacts with the immune system and causes disease, and whether ongoing treatment with medicines such as ACE-inhibitors and ARBs could impact the prognosis of COVID-19.The speculation that ACE-inhibitors or ARBs treatment can make infections worse in the context of COVID-19 is not supported by clinical evidence. These medicines work by affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Because the virus uses a target called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of this system, to enter human cells, and the medicines can increase ACE2, one of the suggestions among others is that they could also increase virus activity.",coronavirus disease,neutral,"

no.

Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/heart-health/your-ace-inhibitor-or-arb-medication-there-a-covid-19-connection," What is the ""suspected"" connection? There are animal studies that suggest angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which the virus uses to enter cells, may be increased in certain parts of the body as a result of taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB. No firm conclusions about COVID-19 can be drawn from these studies, which did not involve humans, viral infection or the lungs, the most commonly affected organ impacted by COVID-19. Early reports suggested that people who did worse after contracting COVID-19 often had high blood pressure. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from that observation since older patients often have high blood pressure and tend to do worse if they acquire COVID-19.",may be increased in certain parts of the body,neutral,"

"
Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.703661/full," The effect of ACEIs/ARBs use on COVID-19 patients has been a controversial topic since the beginning of this pandemic, and some studies even have interposed a risk of taking ACEIs/ARBs using data from previous coronavirus outbreaks and preclinical studies (99). Previously published systematic reviews suggested a lower mortality (25–43%) in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID19 (100–102). Furthermore, a large-scale retrospective study demonstrated that in-hospital use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with a lower risk of 28-day death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension (adjusted HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15–0.66) (80). These data suggested that patients with hypertension might obtain benefits from taking ACEIs/ARBs compared with the non-ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID-19 and support the hypothesis that a drug that diminishes angiotensin-2 activity, such as ACEIs and/or ARBs, can reduce the deadliness of inflammation associated injury in COVID-19. Our result trends in contraindicating the above study results but did not reach statistical significance. Our meta-analysis suggests that the use of ACEIs/ARBs neither increase nor decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2).",neither increase nor decrease mortality,no,"
no.
"
Can ACE and ARBs worsen COVID-19?,https://www.dovepress.com/aceis-and-arbs-and-their-correlation-with-covid-19-a-review-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR," Similarly, no data were reported with respect to the use of ACEIs and ARBs for the infection. Guo et al (2020), in evaluating cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 infection, the use of ACEIs/ARBs did not show any association with mortality.37,45 But previous animal studies showed that ACEIs and ARB increase ACE2 activity. Based on prior animal studies, it was suggested that proposed ACEIs and ARBs can enhance ACE2 activity and thereby increase infectivity of COVID-19 virus. Other studies in mice and humans showed in contrary to the above animal studies. ACE2 mRNA expression in rat heart cells treated with an ACEI 7 and ACE2 activity in the presence of either ACEI or ARBs in humans, in both scenarios the level of ACE2 does not show any change.46
As per Fang et al (2020), it was hypothesized that the use of ACE2 receptor increasing drugs is at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. ACEI initially inhibits ACE leading to decreased angiotensin I levels, causing a possible negative feedback loop that ultimately up-regulates more ACE2 receptor to be able to interact with the decreased angiotensin I substrate available.",in both scenarios the level of ACE2 does not show any change,no,"
no.

World’s Largest Study on ACE Inhibitors, ARBs Shows No Increased Patient Risk of COVID-19 Diagnosis, Complications 

















While the COVID-19 pandemic left the world searching for answers during the earliest stages of the pandemic, one immediate healthcare concern regarded the use of certain antihypertensives, and whether they posed increased risks to patients dealing with hypertension.Evidence, generated by global collaborators within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community and recently published in The Lancet Digital Health, found that there was no increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, or subsequent complications for users of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among an international cohort of more than 1.1 million patients using antihypertensives.This real-world evidence, generated through open-science approaches, support recent regulatory and clinical recommendations that patients should not discontinue ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy due to concerns of increased COVID-19 risk.“People with hypertension have worse COVID-19 outcomes, and there remains speculation that some anti-hypertensive medications may be detrimental,” says corresponding author Marc A. Suchard, a professor at UCLA and research team leader. “The clear answer is that ACE inhibitors and ARBs pose no increased risk as compared to other treatments.”While other studies have generated similar findings recently, this study is the most comprehensive one to date of COVID-19 susceptibility risks for antihypertensive users. OHDSI researchers examined electronic health records from a trio of data sources from the United States and Spain (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Information System for Research in Primary Care) to conduct a systematic cohort study of ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and thiazide diuretic (THZ) users.Furthermore, the findings showed no clinical reason to switch from an ARB to an ACE inhibitor to minimize COVID-19 risk. “Based on our results, if there is a risk difference, it’s marginal and would be very challenging to further refine outside such a large-scale international study,” Suchard said.Powered by open-source tools, state-of-the-art analytical methods and global collaboration within the OHDSI community, these findings provide robust and reproducible real-world evidence. The study design was specifically cited by the European Medicines Agency in the latest version of The European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) Guide on Methodological Standards in Pharmacoepidemiology following its release on a preprint server:Morales et al. supported the reproducibility of their study by publishing the study protocol in the EU PAS Register ahead of time, providing a start-to-finish executable code, facilitating the sharing and exploration of the complete result set with an interactive web application and asking clinicians and epidemiologists to perform a blinded evaluation of propensity score diagnostics for the treatment comparisons.“By comparing people exposed to ACE inhibitor and ARBs against people taking other antihypertensives, either alone or in combination, using two methods across three database the study generated 1280 comparisons to assess the safety of these drugs, producing highly consistent results,” says lead author Daniel Morales, Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Dundee.The International COVID-ACE Receptor Inhibition Utilization and Safety (ICARIUS) protocol, code, and results are all available for further exploration at https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Covid19Icarius.“Open science and collaboration are tenets of the OHDSI community, and they were never more important than early in this pandemic, when we all knew very little about critical questions like antihypertensive risks around COVID-19,” said George Hripcsak, Chair of the Columbia Department of Biomedical Informatics, the coordinating center for OHDSI, and a member of the Columbia Data Science Institute.",pose no increased risk,no,"

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33420786/," Conclusions:
        
      
      Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as efficient protection against infection. The mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research. Trial registration:

      (1) Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and COVID-19. (2) Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significantly lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71%) versus former and nonsmokers (80%).",cannot be considered as efficient protection against infection,no,"

no.
"
Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/behind-the-headlines/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-smoking," The World Health Organization said “Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases.”
Are smokers more or less likely to catch Covid-19? We don’t know for sure whether or not smokers are more likely to catch coronavirus, although we do know they are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. On the one hand, some early articles suggested that smoking could increase your chances of being infected, as smokers tend to touch their face and mouth more often. On the other hand, a recent evidence review by London researchers suggests people who currently smoke may be less likely to be infected with coronavirus. One study suggests this could be because nicotine interferes with ACE2 receptors, which may prevent the virus from entering cells. The researchers said that more scientific research is needed to understand these mixed findings, as the link is still not clear.",We don’t know for sure,neutral,"

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04583410," The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and the long duration of the disease have led to a massive influx of patients admitted in health services and intensive care units. According to current knowledge, there are no treatments that prevent the spread of the infection, especially in exposed populations, or the disease progression to a severe form. Daily active smokers are infrequent among outpatients or hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Several arguments suggest that nicotine is responsible for this protective effect via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Nicotine may inhibit the penetration and spread of the virus and have a prophylactic effect in COVID-19 infection. However, the epidemic is progressing throughout French territory and new variants (in particular the ""English B1.",there are no treatments that prevent the spread of the infection,no,"

"
Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/6/279," This has led to claims that a ‘smoker’s paradox’ may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells).",smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19,yes,"

no
"
Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://rehabs.com/pro-talk/does-smoking-really-protect-against-covid-19/," Women’s sexual arousal is also significantly negatively impacted by smoking. What’s more, we know that the benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh any theoretical protective effects of starting or continuing to smoke against coronavirus infection. Among them: improved immunity, lowered cancer risk, improved circulation and blood pressure, clearer skin, lower cholesterol, and better control over blood sugar and insulin. Simply put, even if there is a curious crop of data suggesting smokers aren’t being admitted to hospitals, seeking treatment, or testing positive for COVID-19 as frequently as non-smokers, these findings by no means confirm that smoking protects against coronavirus infection, nor should they be considered as a means to justify continued smoking or take it up. The data could be erroneous (false positives are a hallmark of new research, which is why replication is required before scientists conclude that their hypotheses are correct). And the consequences of continuing to or starting to smoke are far, far graver than reducing or eliminating cigarette consumption.",these findings by no means confirm that smoking protects against coronavirus infection,neutral,"

I disagree with the retraction and I consider it unfair and unsubstantiated.”The director of Quit Victoria, Dr Sarah White, said retracting the paper was the right move.“We really rely in research in being able to take a dispassionate look at the data but also the interpretation of that data,” she said. “The reader needs to know that the authors have some potential or actual conflict of interest, or they’ve actually been involved with the industry.”Big tobacco giving retailers cash and international trips to promote products, study findsRead moreShe added there was no strong evidence to support the claim that smokers were less likely to acquire Covid or suffer severe effects from it.An analysis for the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine “identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in Covid-19”.The authors of that paper said there had been several studies that reported a so-called “smoker’s paradox” with Covid-19, suggesting smokers might somehow be protected from infection and severe complications.“As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable,” the review found.“In the context of smoking and Covid-19, poor data collection can lead to several erroneous conclusions. If patients with missing smoking data are not eliminated from the total pool, smokers may be wrongly underrepresented. Furthermore, it is difficult to get accurate history from patients who are either intubated or in respiratory failure.“If data from these patients are missing, and these patients are not removed from the denominator, it can give a false impression that smokers are less likely to develop severe disease.",poor data collection can lead to several erroneous conclusions,no,"

"
Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.668995/full," Finally, although our study provides an important perspective in COVID-19 care, our findings remain observational. All things considered, our data may suggest that the effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 could be mediated by nicotine rather than whole tobacco smoke. Nicotine can modulate the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (29–31), which SARS-CoV-2 uses for cellular entry (32–34). This in turn modulates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (35). Hence, we hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 alters the control of the nicotine receptor through acetylcholine. This would explain why previous studies also identified an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity (1, 3, 6).",the effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 could be mediated by nicotine,neutral,"

"
Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-020-00437-5," The possibility that smokers may be less likely to develop severe COVID-19 that would require hospitalization is an important factor in determining the overall smoking-related risk. A higher risk for adverse outcome among hospitalized smokers is not applicable to all smokers if they are indeed less likely than non-smokers to be hospitalized for COVID-19. In March, we hypothesized for the first time that nicotine may be protective against COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory properties and to a potential direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [11, 12]. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway represents a reflex mechanism that modulates the immune response and protects from hyper-inflammation, a hall mark of severe COVID-19 [13, 14]. Therefore, if the virus interacts with the cholinergic system, dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway could result in an uncontrolled immune response. This hypothesis is not contradictory to reports of a higher risk for adverse outcome in hospitalized smokers with COVID-19.",less likely to develop severe COVID-19,neutral,"

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://kwit.app/en/blog/posts/does-smoking-protect-from-covid19," Is it really the case?In 2020, researchers suggested that smoking could protect against severe forms of COVID-19 and many media outlets picked up on the information. Since then, the main paper that assumed a protective effect of smoking against COVID-19 has been depublished due to undeclared links of interest between some of the authors and the tobacco industry. So, does smoking really protect against COVID-19? What would be the links between smoking and coronavirus infection? The still unclear links between smoking, coronavirus infection and ACE-2 receptors
Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV2 which plunged the world into an unprecedented global crisis, enter the body mainly by binding to a cell surface protein: ACE-2 receptors.

Writing in the June 2nd British Medical Journal, investigative reporters Stéphane Horel and Ties Keyzer discounted this possibility, alleging that the authors of some of the relevant research were in the pocket of Big Tobacco and their studies have been discredited:
In the early days of the pandemic, media outlets around the world reported that smokers seemed to be under-represented among patients seriously ill with covid-19 in China and France. The headlines asked, does nicotine protect against covid-19? … It has since been roundly disproved that smoking protects against covid-19 … the BMJ can today also report on undisclosed financial links between certain scientific authors and the tobacco and e-cigarette industry in a number of covid research papers.

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/does-nicotine-protect-us-against-coronavirus-137488," COVID-19 patients may be more likely to deny smoking when asked about their smoking status in hospital, wanting to be seen by medical professionals as doing the right thing. And data collection may have been incomplete for behavioural questions in busy hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. Finally, it’s important to note this paper has not yet been peer-reviewed. Taken together, although there appears to be an association between smoking and COVID-19 in these hospital-based samples, there’s no evidence of a causal relationship – that is, that smoking prevents COVID-19.

WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum and patches are designed to help smokers quit tobacco.

Smoking may keep the body’s system that fights illness from working right. People who smoke cigarettes now, or who smoked in the past, are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The relationship between using e-cigarettes or vaping products and COVID-19 is uncertain.3

A recent study found that among teenagers and young adults who were tested for COVID-19, those who had used e-cigarettes were more likely to be infected than those who did not use e-cigarettes.

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://www.undo.org/disease/stop-smoking-covid," In a review of 5 studies published to date,3 smoking is most likely associated with getting sicker with COVID-19. In the largest study of 1099 people with COVID-19,4 people who smoke were 2.4 times more likely to get really sick (e.g. admitted to an intensive care unit, needing mechanical ventilation, dying) compared to those who did not smoke. Smoking can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other health problems that may contribute to serious illness.2  Stopping smoking still helps your health if you have COPD or heart disease.5
Vaping can also harm lung health. Growing evidence suggests that the aerosol from vaping devices can harm lungs at the cellular and organ levels and worsen the body’s ability to fight respiratory infections.6 The recent outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping-associated product lung injury, predominantly affecting young people, is still a major public health concern.7

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-advice-for-smokers-and-vapers/covid-19-advice-for-smokers-and-vapers," We do not yet have a clear picture on the impact of smoking on COVID-19 risks but there is no specific evidence to suggest that smokers are at greater risk. To reduce the risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus, Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing cigarettes. What are the risks of shisha smoking? Shisha smoking carries all the health risks of smoking, and sharing the mouthpiece greatly increases the risk of spreading COVID-19. PHE strongly advises against sharing any smoking devices.

Can smoking prevent COVID-19?,https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/problem/covid-19," We urge all smokers and vapers to quit at this critical time. We also urge policymakers to take strong action to reduce smoking and vaping, especially among young people.Smoking, vaping & Covid-19: What are health experts saying?Quitting smoking and vaping: Where to get helpResources for parents: Tips for talking to kids about e-cigarettesHow the tobacco industry is exploiting the COVID-19 crisisYouth Resources: Help create the first tobacco-free generationHealth Experts Warn Smokers and Vapers at Greater RiskThe coronavirus attacks the lungs, and behaviors that harm the lungs put individuals at greater risk. The harmful impact of smoking on the lungs is well documented, and there is growing evidence that vaping (use of e-cigarettes) can harm lung health as well:There is conclusive evidence that smoking increases susceptibility for respiratory infections, weakens the immune system and is a major cause of underlying health conditions that increase risk for COVID-19, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other lung diseases, heart disease and diabetes. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Being a current or former cigarette smoker can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.”There is growing evidence that vaping can also harm lung health. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has stated that “emerging evidence suggests that exposure to aerosols from e-cigarettes harms the cells of the lung and diminishes the ability to respond to infection.” Adding to these concerns is the fact that youth e-cigarette use remains at epidemic levels in the U.S. 3.6 million U.S. kids use e-cigarettes, including 1 in five high school students (19.6%).Learn more about what leading public health organizations and medical experts have said about smoking, vaping and COVID-19.Act Now to Reduce Smoking and VapingAs a result, there has never been a more important time to take action to reduce smoking and vaping.We urge smokers and vapers to make every effort to quit.

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.menshealth.com/health/a34394784/blood-type-coronavirus-covid-19/," In 2020, scientists started talking about a link between blood type and Covid. That year, research in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid.Researchers in China first shared this idea in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people who were diagnosed and hospitalized for Covid (this was prior to vaccines), those with type O were more protected.Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with Covid than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely.Where are we now, in 2022, on blood type and Covid? Additional research and review papers have confirmed that we're in more or less the same place: It looks like there really is an association between Type A blood and susceptibility to Covid and Type O blood and less susceptibility. Yet no research so far has been able to pin down the molecular goings on that explain the mechanism behind why this might be so.",people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid,neutral,"
no.

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8286549/," In this cohort, the majority (74%) of COVID-19–positive subjects had mild disease and did not require inpatient hospitalization. Data from tested subjects were compared with 2,204,742 nontested individuals, which accounted for nearly 40% of the total Danish population. The authors found that individuals with type O blood were relatively protected from viral infection (relative risk (RR) = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.91). Unlike previous studies, however, there was no difference between ABO blood type and progression of illness to hospitalization or mortality (each, P > .40). Rh typing was not collected in this analysis.In our investigation, we performed a multi-institutional analysis across 5 hospitals in the New England region [18]. A total of 7,648 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, of which 1,289 (16.9%) were positive.",individuals with type O blood were relatively protected from viral infection,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/how-blood-type-affects-covid-19," Yet these risks are relative, meaning people with type O blood are not immune to COVID-19. ""We do know that people of all types can get infected with COVID-19,"" says cardiologist Daniel Anderson, MD, PhD. Your blood type may also affect how severe the progression of COVID-19 will be. ""Some evidence shows the severity of the infection is associated with different blood cell types, but the mechanisms by which it happens are unclear,"" says Dr. Anderson. Blood type is not the only factor in disease severity.

"
Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.prevention.com/health/a39384247/blood-type-covid-19-severity/," And an early study from China also found that people with Type O blood were at a lower risk of being infected with COVID-19, while those with Type A were at a higher risk.“There have been multiple studies on blood types and COVID risk,” Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. “A few have not supported this association, but the majority have. It’s really fascinating.”Experts say there is potentially something to this. “Blood proteins may be correlated with immune function and inflammatory response,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Dr. Russo points out that the exact reason for this is still being studied, but there are some theories on why this may happen. One is that having Type O blood gives you antibodies against Types A and AB that may lower your risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through a particular receptor in your cells.",gives you antibodies against Types A and AB,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.hematology.org/newsroom/press-releases/2020/possible-link-between-blood-type-and-covid-19," These new studies add evidence that there may be an association between blood type and vulnerability to COVID-19; however, additional research is needed to better understand why and what it means for patients. Individuals with blood type O may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 infection
Blood type O may offer some protection against COVID-19 infection, according to a retrospective study. Researchers compared Danish health registry data from more than 473,000 individuals tested for COVID-19 to data from a control group of more than 2.2 million people from the general population. Among the COVID-19 positive, they found fewer people with blood type O and more people with A, B, and AB types. The study results suggest that people with blood types A, B, or AB may be more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than people with type O. The researchers did not find any significant difference in rate of infection between A, B, and AB types.",may offer some protection,neutral,"

"
Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/blood-type-covid-19-risk," A comprehensive review of studies published in Seminars in Vascular Surgery in September 2021 examined peer-reviewed journal articles published from March 2020 to January 2021. Researchers found inconsistent findings but did identify certain trends suggesting that blood type A might predispose one to increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), or that type O and Rh-negative blood groups might be protective. Still, the study authors wrote, ""the impact of blood type on clinical outcomes remains unclear. At this point in time, there does not appear to be any relationship between blood type and COVID-19–related severity of illness or mortality."" The Role of Blood Type and Virus Risk  

While the link between blood type and COVID-19 risk is still unclear, it's important to note that there have been links between blood type and diseases in the past.

"
Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.767771/full," Muniz-Diaz et al. found that blood group A has significantly high risk of mortality as compared to non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O is associated with significantly low risk of mortality (Muniz-Diaz et al., 2021). Our study contrasts with these studies, as we found that ABO and Rh blood groups are not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Similar to the current results, Solmaz and Araç also found that blood groups have no association with mortality of the patients (Solmaz and Araç, 2021).ConclusionOur study has found that blood groups A, B, and Rh+ are more disposed to COVID-19 infection, whereas blood groups O, AB, and Rh− are significantly of lower risk of COVID-19 infection. ABO and Rh blood groups show no impact on the progression of disease and are not associated with susceptibility to severity of disease or mortality. We also found that blood groups A and Rh+ types are associated with a decrease in recovery period, whereas blood groups O and Rh− are associated with increase in recovery period.However, the ABO and/or Rh blood groups may not be responsible for this association, as these may indicate an unexplored underlying factor like comorbidity.",lower risk of COVID-19 infection,neutral,"

Children and COVID-19










Blood type is not associated with a severe worsening of symptoms in people who have tested positive for COVID-19, according to HMS researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital. Although the findings dispel previous reports suggesting that a certain ABO blood type could lead to increased disease severity, they did indicate that symptomatic individuals with blood types B and AB who are Rh+ are more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than people with other blood types. Symptomatic people with blood type O are less likely to test positive. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred research to ﬁnd characteristics that render individuals more susceptible to the virus, as well as risk factors that intensify its severity and progression. Some have suggested there may be a link between the disease and blood type. The researchers drew upon the Mass General Brigham Research Patient Data Registry to assemble a study population of 1,289 symptomatic adult patients whose blood type had been recorded and who had tested positive for COVID-19.",Symptomatic people with blood type O are less likely to test positive,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,http://www.htct.com.br/en-abo-blood-group-association-covid-19--articulo-S2531137921001346," Many studies have investigated the association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Data from theses studies suggest that the ABO blood group could be one of the factors that may play a role in determining COVID-19 susceptibilty, severity and mortality. The data reviewed in this review suggets that blood group O could potentially decrease the susceptibility against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. On the other hand, individuals with blood group A have been demonstrated to be at greater risk for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious outcomes. However, the studies discussed herein may have been influenced by several confounding factors. These confounding variables include the number of patients included, the types of controls used for comparison and the relative ABO frequencies in the population studied, as these variations in the ABO blood group frequencies between populations of different geographical locations may represent an important source of potential bias.",blood group O could potentially decrease the susceptibility,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19623-x," We find slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimate Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19. IntroductionThe novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has spread rapidly across the globe and has caused over 21.1 million confirmed infections and over 761,000 deaths worldwide as of August 17, 20201.

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/10/20/covid-blood-type," The researchers wrote that their findings demonstrate that blood Type O ""is significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to"" the novel coronavirus—though they also noted that their study had several limitations and called for further research on the topic. For the second study, researchers in Canada analyzed data on 95 patients in Vancouver who tested positive for the coronavirus between February and April. All of the patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 in an ICU. Among those patients, the researchers found that those with Type A or AB blood had a median ICU stay of 13.5 days, compared to with a median ICU stay of nine days among patients with blood Type O or B. The researchers also found that the patients with Type A or AB blood were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, at 84%, than patients with blood Type O or B, at 61%. The researchers wrote that, overall, their findings ""demonstrate that critically ill Covid-19 patients with blood [Type] A or AB are associated with an increased risk for requiring mechanical ventilation … and prolonged ICU length of stay compared with patients with blood [Type] O or B.""","reduced susceptibility to"" the novel coronavirus",neutral,"

Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.A new study indicates that people with type O blood have a lower risk of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 than people with other blood types.The researchers also noted that people with type O blood are less likely to develop a serious illness if they do have the virus. The findings are similar to a study published in June where researchers concluded that people with type A blood were associated with having a 45 percent higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.Those researchers studied 1,900 people in Spain and Italy who were seriously ill with COVID-19 and compared their results with 2,000 people who were not sick.In March, a study out of China suggested that people with type A blood might be more susceptible to getting the virus and people with type O blood might have more protection against the virus.The reports have some experts worried that people with type A blood might panic or worry and that people with type O blood might let their guard down or get too complacent. “These results can’t be used to lessen the serious precautions that everyone needs to take, regardless of their blood type,” Dr. Mary Cushman, MSc, a hematologist and professor at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, said in March.“Someone on social media this weekend wondered if the type O people in families should be the ones sent out for shopping, for instance,” Cushman told Healthline. “We definitely don’t want people thinking they can be protected and don’t have to take precautions because they are type O.”What the March study reportedThe March study came out of Wuhan, China, where the first known cases of COVID-19 were discovered.In the study, scientists looked at the blood types of 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared that with the blood types of the general population in that region.They found that in the normal population, type A was 31 percent, type B was 24 percent, type AB was 9 percent, and type O was 34 percent.In those with the virus, type A was 38 percent, type B was 26 percent, type AB was 10 percent, and type O was 25 percent.The researchers concluded that “blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups.",they can be protected and don’t have to take precautions,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/causal-link-blood-type-covid19-severity-genetic-study/," “Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19 but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is more likely candidate for follow-up studies.”Of course, there are a number of risk factors beyond blood type known to play a role in COVID-19 severity, from age to pre-existing illness. So these findings should not be a cause for concern to those with type A blood.Instead, as co-last author on the study Gerome Breen explains, these findings help researchers investigate novel therapeutic pathways to help treat COVID-19. For example, several blood proteins were identified in the study as causally linked to a decreased risk of severe disease.These proteins, known as adhesion molecules, play a role in the interactions between immune cells and blood vessels. The researchers hypothesize these adhesion molecules may be helping moderate the severity of late-stage COVID-19 and it may be possible to turn this discovery into a therapy to prevent sick patients deteriorating in hospital.“What we have done in our study is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research,” said Breen. “Out of 1,000s of blood proteins we have whittled it down to about 14 that have some form of causal connection to the risk of severe COVID-19 and present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies.”The new study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics.Source: King’s College London

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.ivirma.com/press/patients-with-blood-group-type-o-and-rh-positive-may-have-greater-protection-against-covid-19.html," And the eternal question: Will we ever be free from it? Could factors such as blood type play a role in making people susceptible to the disease? In this sense, a multicentre study recently published by IVI and presented at the latest edition of the ASRM (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) Congress, one of the world's largest congresses on Reproductive Medicine, shows that patients with O positive blood group and Rh positive have greater protection against COVID-19. “In the data analysed in our population in the post-confinement period from May to June, with a sample of 6,140 patients for SARS-CoV-2, we found that the incidence of disease (understood as patients who had positive antibodies, either IgM or IgG) was lower in patients with group O, with significant findings that the Rh-negative group was more frequent among those infected, contrary to what had been previously published.”, said Dr. Antonio Requena, IVI Medical Director. “The positive rate does not vary significantly with age and no differences were observed in terms of gender or blood group. However, Rh-negative individuals were found to have a slightly higher risk of infection than Rh-positive individuals.",patients with O positive blood group and Rh positive have greater protection,neutral,"

Can having type O blood prevent COVID-19,https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/new-research-suggests-a-causal-link-between-blood-group-and-severe-covid-19," The analysis identified that an enzyme (ABO) that determines blood group was causally associated with both an increased risk of hospitalisation and a requirement for respiratory support. This supports previous findings around the association of blood group with higher likelihood of death. Taken together with previous research showing that the proportion of group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests blood group A is candidate for follow-up studies. Co-last author Dr Christopher Hübel from King's IoPPN said, “The enzyme helps determine the blood group of an individual and our study has linked it with both risk of hospitalisation and the need of respiratory support or death. Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19 but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19 positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is more likely candidate for follow-up studies.”

What we have done in our study is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research. Out of 1000s of blood proteins we have whittled it down to about 14 that have some form of causal connection to the risk of severe COVID-19 and present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies.– Professor Gerome Breen, co-last author and Professor of Genetics at the IoPPN, King's College London

5 have further noted that people with B and/or O blood groups were less represented among COVID-19 patients, thereby highlighting the possible beneficial role of anti-A antibodies in COVID-19 susceptibility. In fact, it was known that anti-A antibodies can block the adhesion of SARS-CoV S-protein to ACE2 expressing cell lines.6 Given the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it might be prudent to hypothesise a protective role of anti-A antibodies against COVID-19 severity as well. However, existing clinical evidence in this regard is controversial. Hoiland et al
7 had reported that critically ill COVID-19 patients with blood groups A and AB (lacking anti-A antibodies) were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care compared with patients with B/O (with anti-A antibodies). However, a genomewide association study of severe COVID-19 patients showed that those with blood group A had a higher risk of severe disease, while blood group O had a protective effect.8 Other studies found no association between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 severity/mortality.9–12 We aimed to summarise the available literature and provide a pooled analysis of the effect of A/AB (without anti-A antibodies) on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients compared with B/O (with anti-A antibodies) blood groups.This meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.13 We (SB and MB) independently performed a systematic search of the literature across the PubMed database from inception till 30 November 2020, using the following keywords interposed with appropriate Boolean operators: “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND “ABO blood groups”.Observational studies of case–control or cohort design were selected.",blood group O had a protective effect,neutral,"

Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them. They will not kill
the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.To protect yourself against COVID-19, disinfect objects and surfaces, especially the ones you touch regularly. You can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that. Make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth

Can methanol prevent COVID-19,https://emj.bmj.com/content/37/7/416," global healthinfectious diseases, viralpoisoning, mass incidentspoisoningtoxicologyDear editorMethanol ingestion can be a highly lethal poisoning; methanol is metabolised to formaldehyde and formic acid, which are extremely toxic to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract leading to a triad of visual impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms and metabolic acidosis in 6–24 hours.1Haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic necrosis of basal ganglia, white matter necrosis, and diffuse brain oedema may result in a grave prognosis.2 3 Although alcohol consumption is illegal in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as many other Islamic countries based on religious reasons, there have been sporadic reports of alcohol poisoning, usually in the form of methanol intoxication, mostly found in illegally produced alcoholic beverages. Previous outbreaks of methanol poisoning in Iran in 2007, 2013 and 2018, resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.2–4 The most recent outbreak, and perhaps the most significant, coincides with the coronavirus pandemic. Our records show a dramatic increase in cases of methanol intoxication in March and April 2020; as of 16 April 2020, there have been 797 cases of methanol poisoning with 97 deaths in the Fars province, Iran, reported by the Head of Emergency Medical Service of the Fars province.5 These numbers, from a single province, supersede the previous largest report from the whole country (768 intoxicated subjects) in 2018,4 and there are similar reports of methanol poisonings in several other centres throughout the country during this period.Unlike prior outbreaks, the current outbreak of methanol poisoning appears to be due to the belief that consumption of disinfectants and sanitizers, specifically, alcohol, would be beneficial in preventing the COVID-19 infection. This is supported by several cases of methanol poisoning in children resulting from a desperate attempt by parents to prevent or cure the infection. When facing a serious health threat, refractory to the available remedies, such irrational decision making is anticipated, leading to quack cures and dubious prophylactic measures.6 Appropriate public education is mandatory to fight the misinformation that is being spread through social media about the alcohol and other similar disinfecting agents. This is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality and also to protect an already exhausted healthcare system from excess burden during a devastating pandemic.References↵

Acute methanol poisoning is a life-threatening type of metabolic and neurological intoxication that commonly occurs following the accidental ingestion of methylated spirits (Kraut and Kurtz 2008). Methyl alcohol toxicity in Iran related to the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has attracted the attention of the medical professionals. Just a few days after the widespread coronavirus outbreak, unfounded rumors circulated on social media that drinking or gargling alcohol could prevent or cure COVID-19. Subsequently, hospitals encountered a spike in the referral of poisoning cases for the ingestion of industrial-grade ethanol, resulting in an unprecedented high death toll due to alcohol poisoning. As of April 20, 2020, at the time of writing this letter, 700 people have died as a result of ingesting denatured alcohol in an attempt to fight the novel coronavirus.",Toll of acute methanol poisoning,no,"

It is possible that fear of COVID-19 kept methanol poisoning victims from seeking and obtaining timely care. This highlights the importance of early identification and initiation of treatment, which can be supplemented by “active case finding” by treating physicians and public health agencies [5]. Public health messaging and strategic planning are crucial to prevent future methanol outbreaks [6]. Availability of data and materials

However, as noted above, there are no hand sanitizers, including those containing benzalkonium chloride, that are legally marketed specifically for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Hand sanitizers using active ingredients other than alcohol (ethanol), isopropyl alcohol, or benzalkonium chloride are not legally marketed, and FDA recommends that consumers avoid their use. Q.

Although people using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment for potential reversal of the toxic effects of methanol poisoning.

Can methanol prevent COVID-19,https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e1.htm," Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%–95% alcohol (≥60% ethanol or ≥70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol.",not an acceptable ingredient,no,"

Can methanol prevent COVID-19,https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Keep-Hand-Sanitizer-Out-of-Childrens-Reach.aspx," The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued 
 recalls for products containing methanol, which is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It can cause problems ranging from nausea and headaches to blindness, nervous system damage or death. An FDA 
 import alert also warns about products found to contain methanol and/or 1-propanol, another form of alcohol that should not be used in hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizer poisonings during the COVID-19 pandemicSince families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System has been getting many more reports of unintentional exposures in children.

There is a misinformation belief that drinking alcohol (methanol) will somehow cure or prevent being infected by COVID-19. Consuming alcohol will not kill the virus, but its consumption will likely increase health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus. Alcohol (at a concentration of at least 60% by volume) works as a disinfectant on your skin. However, it has no such function within your system when it is taken orally. There is also misinterpretation saying that drinking alcohol kills the virus in the inhaled air. We should be clear that the consumption of alcohol will not kill the virus in the inhaled air.",drinking alcohol (methanol) will somehow cure or prevent being infected,no,"

        Hand sanitizers have become a popular defense to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19, but experts warn of some varieties that contain the hidden ingredient methanol, which could be dangerous for children. Hand sanitizers have become a successful defense against the coronavirus, so much so that for a short time, it was difficult to find them on store shelves. More recently, they’ve been easier to find, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is raising concerns about certain hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Kenya M. Parks, MD “While we want to encourage the use of hand sanitizers among our patient population to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19, we want to warn them against some of these products that include methanol, a substance that can be life-threatening when absorbed via the skin or ingested,” said Kenya Maria Parks, MD, FAAP, a pediatrician at UT Physicians and assistant professor of pediatrics at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth. The FDA is currently investigating the use of methanol in these hand sanitizers, which are primarily manufactured in Mexico.","methanol, which could be dangerous for children",no,"

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/14/qa-does-handwashing-stem-the-transmission-of-covid-19," Photograph: Photographer is my life./Getty ImagesJames TapperSun 14 Feb 2021 10.00 GMTLast modified on Mon 15 Feb 2021 10.52 GMTIs handwashing still an important way to reduce the spread of Covid-19?In the early days of the pandemic, public health experts emphasised handwashing as a way to prevent infection and the government launched a “Hands, Face, Space” campaign to encourage people to wash their hands, wear masks and keep 2 metres apart. Subsequent research has shown the biggest risk of Covid-19 transmission is through particles in the air.Why did we focus on handwashing?When little was known about Covid-19, researchers focused on fomites – surfaces such as handrails where the virus might be able to survive without a host for some time – because other diseases such as norovirus can be transmitted that way. How does Covid-19 spread?Surface transmission may happen, but speaking and coughing seem to play a much larger role, because we emit tiny aerosol water particles containing the virus. Indoors, those particles can linger for minutes or hours, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest last week that people wear two masks. It now says surface transmission is “not thought to be a common way that Covid-19 spreads”.Can handwashing prevent the spread of Covid-19?Although there is limited evidence that fomites do play a role, there is no evidence that Covid does not linger on surfaces.

It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention. Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we live through this pandemic, and beyond, to protect us from diseases,’ said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. With COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance. To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste.",To stop the spread of COVID-19,neutral,"

Respiratory viruses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread when mucus or droplets containing the virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat. Most often, this happens through your hands. Hands are also one of the most common ways that the virus spreads from one person to the next. During a global pandemic, one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Here’s everything you need to know about how to wash your hands the right way:

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9250256/," Only one study [40] involving 20 index patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 in Beijing and 79 of their household contacts investigated a specific frequency of hand washing and showed that hand washing at least 5 times per day was associated with reduced risk of transmission (52.8% vs.76.9%; p = 0.04).One study [33], conducted amongst 348 hospitalised COVID-19 cases and 348 patients hospitalised for other reasons in Al-Nasiriya city in Iraq, investigated “healthy hand washing”; however, provided no details on what this involved. Nevertheless, “healthy hand washing” was significantly associated with lower risk of infection (p < 0.001).Two studies [37, 39] focused on both, the duration of hand washing (for at least 20 seconds) and hand washing or ABHR use at specific times, including after contact with high-risk [39] or symptomatic [37] individuals, washing hands when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, before or after handling food, after using toilet, after outdoor activity, before or after attending to a child or sick person, after sneezing or coughing, after handling pets and before touching the mouth or nose area [37]. The studies were conducted in Ohio and Florida, with the involvement of 113 COVID-19 cases and 226 controls [39] and in Macao, China amongst 24 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and 1113 control participants who completed quarantine after travelling from a COVID-19 high-risk foreign country [37].Lio et al. [37] reported that washing hands after outdoor activity (aOR: 0.021; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.134; p < 0.005) and before touching the mouth and nose area (aOR: 0.303; 95% CI: 0.114, 0.808; p < 0.05) were found to be independent protective factors against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Interestingly, Lio et al. [37], also found that compared to control participants, infected individuals were significantly less likely to report washing hands after contact with someone who had respiratory symptoms (50% vs. 95.3%; p = 0.005), but not after contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% vs. 95.2%; p = 0.057), while Speaker et al.",reduced risk of transmission,neutral,"

Frequent, thorough handwashing with soap and water is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and is an important defence against COVID-19. Like a cold, coronaviruses are spread through droplets from a person coughing or sneezing, and via contaminated surfaces. Good hygiene is key to avoiding spreading it – and catching it. Along with other important behaviours such as physical distancing and wearing a mask, thoroughly washing hands often and at key moments is essential to controlling the pandemic.","Frequent, thorough handwashing",neutral,"

Learn to wash your hands the right way.] Hand washing can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 because it removes any virus particles we may have picked up while touching things out in the world. “When an unmasked person infected with the virus breathes, talks, sings, shouts, sneezes, or coughs, exhaled breath filled with visible and invisible respiratory droplets spew in the surrounding airspace,” Sethi explains. “These droplets will eventually land on surfaces where the virus can remain intact for hours and days, long after someone has left the room.”

Good hand washing is the first line of defense against the spread of illnesses, including coronavirus (COVID-19). And it helps protect you against everything from the common cold to more serious infections, such as meningitis, bronchiolitis, the flu, hepatitis A, and many types of diarrhea. Germs spread in lots of ways. For example:

touching dirty hands
changing dirty diapers
through contaminated water and food
through droplets in the air released during a cough or sneeze
on contaminated surfaces
through contact with a sick person's body fluids

The new coronavirus has proven deadly, but it can also be defeated with something as simple as soap suds. In this animation, Health Matters explains how handwashing with soap kills the coronavirus and why it’s the best defense against the spread of COVID-19. “Soap molecules disrupt the fatty layer or coat surrounding the virus, ” says Dr. David Goldberg, an internist and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Westchester and an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “Once the viral coat is broken down, the virus is no longer able to function.”
The best way to protect yourself from the coronavirus remains avoiding exposure — and helping to prevent its spread. That’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages social distancing, wearing a face mask in public places, and, of course, handwashing with soap.",Health Matters explains how handwashing with soap kills the coronavirus,neutral,"

Can handwashing prevent COVID-19?,http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/prevention-risks/hand-washing," Washing your hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds is most effective. This is because soap actively destroys the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 and really reduces how much of the virus is left on your skin. Alcohol-based hand rubs can be used to disinfect your hands when soap and water are not available. Stop the spread of COVID-19 and other germs Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Using soap and water is the single most effective way of reducing the spread of infection because soap actively destroys the surface of the virus.If soap and water are not available, alcohol-based hand rubs can be used to clean your hands as long as they are not visibly soiled. If they are visibly soiled, use a wipe and then alcohol-based hand rubs to effectively clean them.Note that Health Canada has recently recalled some hand sanitizer products; check your products against the

The associations between the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and handwashing behavior are consistent with TMT [22, 23], which suggests that frequency of protective health behaviors may be lower when mortality information is not salient in focal attention. Thus, even if COVID-19 morbidity and mortality cases accumulate and individuals are still being regularly exposed to respective mortality information, lower rates of handwashing may be observed. However, increases in recent cases may increase the salience of COVID-19 morbidity, resulting in spikes in handwashing behaviors.The patterns of associations between the individual-level variables and handwashing adherence are similar to those found in other research. Earlier studies indicated that handwashing (and other COVID-19 preventive behaviors) was more prevalent among women than among men [3, 7, 8], among older participants, and among those with higher self-reported economic status [8]. Although we found no studies testing associations between exposure to handwashing information and frequency/adherence to handwashing, knowledge about correct steps in washing hands (most likely obtained via exposure to respective information) was related to higher handwashing frequency in earlier research [8].",lower rates of handwashing may be observed,neutral,"

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04583410," Several arguments suggest that nicotine is responsible for this protective effect via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Nicotine may inhibit the penetration and spread of the virus and have a prophylactic effect in COVID-19 infection. However, the epidemic is progressing throughout French territory and new variants (in particular the ""English B1. 1.7 variant of SARS-COV-2"") much more contagious run a risk of accelerating the epidemic in the population. The anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccines recently launched (or being evaluated) represent great hope in this health crisis, but trials were only able to show their effectiveness on symptomatic forms of SARS-COV-2 infection.

Google Scholar—on the basis of cellular and animal studies—that nicotine might reduce the risk of COVID-19 by either competing with the virus for surface binding or attenuating inflammation must, at the very least, be treated with great caution. Indeed, the limited published evidence to date on the effect of nicotine on airway cells in vitro suggests that it can induce rapid and long-lasting increases in gene and protein expression of ACE2, which in turn increases the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in cells and cause a cytopathic effect.11Maggi F Rosellini A Spezia PG et al.Nicotine upregulates ACE2 expression and increases competence for SARS-CoV-2 in human pneumocytes.ERJ Open Res. 2021; 7 (00713-2020. )Crossref

However, some studies report that the number of current smokers hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than expected, considering the prevalence of smoking in individual countries. Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm. Conclusions:
        
      
      There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking.

But it is critically important to note that the current, observational findings cannot establish a causal effect of this medication. It could also be that patients with less severe acute illness were more likely to receive medication to quit smoking.

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://openres.ersjournals.com/content/7/2/00713-2020," Moreover, it is possible to hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication may be facilitated or induced through mechanisms related to nAChR-mediated pathways, all converging to ACE2 regulation and signalling [14, 24]. Additionally, nicotine exposure induces a pro-thrombotic state via stimulation of tissue factor expression both in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [25] as well as neo-angiogenesis [26] and, finally, elevated serum cotinine levels, the metabolite of nicotine, are associated with left atrial abnormalities, a possible mechanism for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [27]. Importantly, post mortem examinations of people who died with COVID-19 revealed widespread vascular abnormalities including thrombosis, microangiopathy, and a high degree of angiogenesis [28]. Taking into consideration all the above findings and the observation that nicotine potentiates viral infections [29], it is unlikely that smoking or vaping may offer therapeutic benefits in COVID-19.Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of action through which nicotine could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Evidence on the regulation of ACE2 in the lungs after exposure to nicotine is still inconclusive, with evidence both for down-regulated ACE2 axis [30], in bronchial epithelial cells [31] and for enhanced ACE2 expression in lung tissue of COPD patients, at a lower extent in healthy smokers, and absent in healthy non-smoking individuals [22, 32–34].It is important to remark that, until now, there is no indication that nicotine prevents the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells or that it protects cells from the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for this reason, we planned studies where cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence or absence of nicotine.We investigated here whether ACE2 is overexpressed in pneumocytes after exposure to nicotine, and if this leads in turn to increased SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathic effect.Materials and methodsCells exposure to nicotineNicotine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) was assayed using in vitro experiments for its ability to stimulate ACE2 expression in A549 cells.

                          Early epidemiologic studies documented lower rates of active smokers compared to former or non-smokers in symptomatic patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was hypothesized that nicotine may interact with SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by downregulating the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and might mitigate the inflammatory response induced by the virus through activation of the nicotinic cholinergic system. This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of nicotine administered by a transdermal patch in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. The results show that transdermal nicotine did not significantly reduce day-28 mortality. 60-Day mortality, time to successful extubation, days alive and free from mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressor support or organ failure were also not modified by nicotine. IntroductionThe world population remains at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially with the emergence of genetic variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with increase in transmissibility, potential for more severe disease and significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination [1, 2].",nicotine may interact with SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells,neutral,"

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/does-nicotine-protect-us-against-coronavirus-137488," SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, gains entry into human cells by latching onto protein receptors called ACE2, which are found on certain cells’ surfaces. The researchers have proposed nicotine attaches to the ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the virus from attaching and potentially reducing the amount of virus that can get into a person’s lung cells. The researchers are now planning to test their hypothesis in a randomised trial involving nicotine patches; though the trial is still awaiting approval from French health authorities. So how should we interpret the results? These counterintuitive results may be due to several biases, so let’s explore some alternative explanations.",preventing the virus from attaching,neutral,"

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24148-y," Our findings suggest that nicotine might not have a protective role in the risk of COVID-19 as previously hypothesized. IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly worldwide. By October 3, 2022, there were more than 618 million confirmed SARS-COV-2 cases and more than 6.5 million deaths attributable to COVID-191. Researchers have explored potential risk factors to identify patients at high risk of infection or death, as well as for targeting pharmaceutical and preventive interventions2.Tobacco use, as a leading risk factor of death and disability due to respiratory diseases, was expected to increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progression and deaths3,4. Smokers have generally increased risk of other respiratory infections and could be expected to have higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 due to repetitive hand-to-mouth handlings, increased mask handlings5, sharing of cigarettes and vape devices6 and creation of aerosols which might be carriers of viruses. On the other hand, smokers might have fewer social contacts7 and be less exposed to indoor places8.",not have a protective role in the risk of COVID-19,no,"

The nicotine hypothesis of Covid 19 is presently followed up along two lines of research. One is clinical and carried out by Prof. Amouras team. It is to assess the effect of nicotine patches: 1. in the prevention of SARS-Cov2 infection in health care workers; 2. on worsening of Covid-19 hospitalized patients, and 3. on severely ill Covid-19 patients. The other includes biological studies carried out mostly at the Institut Pasteur on a possible interaction of the virus spike protein in vitro with the nAChR by Electron Microscopy and other physical methods, and in vivo on cellular and animal model systems about a possible relationship between SARS-Cov2 virus action and nicotine.",along two lines of research,neutral,"

Is the rumor true, from the research out of France, that nicotine protects smokers from COVID-19 and could be used as a possible treatment option? No, it is not true. Smokers are considered at higher risk for a more severe illness for COVID-19. Unsupported claims have no place in public health. The article from France about smokers protected from COVID-19 has significant research limitations, including being a cross-sectional observational study, having a small sample size from one hospital, was not peer-reviewed, which is standard for any scientific research, and one of the authors in a similar opinion piece has a long history with tobacco funding.12 Tragically, this type of unfounded research and inflammatory headline puts people’s lives at risk.",nicotine protects smokers from COVID-19,no,"

All things considered, our data may suggest that the effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 could be mediated by nicotine rather than whole tobacco smoke. Nicotine can modulate the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (29–31), which SARS-CoV-2 uses for cellular entry (32–34). This in turn modulates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (35). Hence, we hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 alters the control of the nicotine receptor through acetylcholine. This would explain why previous studies also identified an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity (1, 3, 6).",modulate the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor,neutral,"

Can Nicotine help COVID-19?,https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/behind-the-headlines/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-smoking," On the other hand, a recent evidence review by London researchers suggests people who currently smoke may be less likely to be infected with coronavirus. One study suggests this could be because nicotine interferes with ACE2 receptors, which may prevent the virus from entering cells. The researchers said that more scientific research is needed to understand these mixed findings, as the link is still not clear. And this kind of study can’t show cause and effect – so we don’t know whether the association found is caused by smoking or something else that was different about smokers (for example smokers may have had a higher rate of exposure to Covid-19 for some reason). One paper claiming that smoking may reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection (from the University of Piraeus and University of Utah) was retracted after two of its authors were found to have ties to the tobacco industry.

By Dr. Liji Thomas, MDJul 31 2022Reviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 6.4 million deaths to date. A new Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research journal study discusses the utility of cannabidiol (CBD) in treating the inflammatory symptoms of COVID-19. This treatment approach could help arrest or reduce the progression of COVID-19, thereby potentially decreasing its severity and mortality rate.

Can medicinal cannabis help to prevent or treat COVID-19? Prevention
To date, the range and scope of verifiable research data linking cannabinoids with COVID-19 prevention is highly limited; however, novel approaches to the prevention of COVID-19 include a single study examining the possibility of incorporating CBD into oral solutions, such as mouthwashes and throat gargling liquids, with a view to ‘lowering or modulating ACE2 levels in high-risk tissues’. Studies have found that ACE2 levels change during the progression of COVID-19 and therefore the ability to modulate these levels becomes particularly important as ACE2 has been shown to be essential for lung function in animal models of SARS viruses. Reducing severity and impact
In analyses of COVID-19 there has been a significant degree of interest in the phenomenon of cytokine storm syndrome, wherein too many cytokine proteins are released in the body: these proteins can attack the lungs and overwhelm the immune system with hyperinflammation. Early evidence has tentatively indicated that CBD and THC may be beneficial in the treatment of patients whose bodies’ inflammatory response has become pathogenic.",prevent or treat,neutral,"

Researchers have revealed that cannabidiol (CBD), which is an active ingredient found in cannabis might help block infection with the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been established after the laboratory studies that CBD has shown promising results, however, further investigation is needed to produce a concrete result as the possible effect still needs to be tested on humans.It should be noted that many potential COVID-19 treatments that showed promise in test tubes have not worked or benefitted researchers during Covid studies/trials.

A total of 30 serious adverse events were reported, including 18 serious adverse events from 14 patients (5.8%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 12 serious adverse events from 11 patients (4.6%) in the placebo group. Discussion
                            


In this multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 34 US hospitals, treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not improve or worsen clinical outcomes for adults hospitalized for respiratory illness from COVID-19. These findings were consistent in all subgroups and for all outcomes evaluated, including an ordinal scale of clinical status, mortality, organ failures, duration of oxygen use, and hospital length of stay. Enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine as a potential therapy for COVID-19 was sparked by in vitro studies that suggested it limited entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells by inhibiting glycosylation of cell receptors targeted by coronaviruses and increasing endosomal pH, thereby reducing endosome-mediated viral entry.6-8 Additionally, hydroxychloroquine reduces the production of several proinflammatory cytokines involved in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a severe manifestation of COVID-19.3-5 These factors, combined with broad availability, oral administration, and perceived safety based on historical use in the treatment of malaria and rheumatologic diseases,4 led to widespread clinical use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.10,15 On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19,29 which was later revoked on June 15, 2020.30 
The finding of this clinical trial that hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious for the treatment of COVID-19 is consistent with results from recent in vitro studies suggesting no antiviral activity for hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-231,32 and open-label pragmatic trials in the United Kingdom33 and Brazil34 suggesting no clinical benefit. Interpreted along with these prior studies, the results of this trial provide strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not beneficial for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Strengths of this trial included its blinded, placebo-controlled design, high adherence to the study protocol, rigorous monitoring for safety events and adverse events, and rapid recruitment from geographically diverse hospitals serving ethnically and racially diverse populations within the US.",did not improve or worsen clinical outcomes,neutral,"

Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine did not result in higher rates of serious adverse events including sudden death, ventricular arrhythmias, or retinopathy.Implications of all evidence availableThe COPE trial and the related meta-analysis demonstrated that the incidence of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was similar between treatment groups with no concerns regarding safety. The 95% confidence interval around the effect estimate shows that potential benefits or harms cannot be clearly excluded. Therefore, the definitive answer about the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients with COVID-19 remains uncertain and this treatment should not be routinely used in this clinical setting.IntroductionAs of March 2022, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 450 million people and caused approximately 6.0 million deaths worldwide since 2019.1World Health Organization (WHO)WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard.

The Minnesota study is one of a triad of randomized controlled trials, organized by David Boulware, that aimed to test hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy. One tested giving the drug to people after they were exposed to patients with Covid-19; that trial also failed. This trial tested using the drug right after symptoms began. A third study, for which results have not yet been reported, gave hydroxychloroquine to doctors and other people at high risk of getting Covid-19 before they were exposed to the virus.",tended to do worse,neutral,"

Another hope for hydroxychloroquine, that it might prevent people exposed to the virus from getting sick, also faded last week when David Boulware of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and colleagues published the results of the largest study to date of this strategy, called postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The researchers sent either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo by mail to 821 people who had been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient for more than 10 minutes without proper protection. They reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that 12% of the people who took the drug went on to develop COVID-19 symptoms, versus 14% in a placebo group, a difference that was not statistically significant. A second large PEP trial has come up empty as well, its leader tells Science.

FDA: Hydroxychloroquine will not prevent COVID-19Despite President Trump's thoughts, drug and disease experts seem to agree that hydroxychloroquine is not a proven preventative measure for COVID-19.USA TODAYUpdate: In June, the authors of the study below asked that it be retracted, saying they were no longer confident in its findings. Other studies have raised questions about using the drug against COVID-19. While many U.S. hospitals used hydroxychloroquine early in the outbreak, they have since moved away from the drug. Original article:A new study shows coronavirus patients who took hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 had a higher risk of death than those who weren't given the drug. The study, published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet, also found that COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop serious heart arrhythmias if treated with hydroxychloroquine, or its closely related cousin chloroquine. Arrhythmias can lead to a sudden cardiac death, the report said, but researchers did not associate the study’s fatalities with adverse cardiac affects.Even though it’s only an observational study – not the gold standard double-blind, randomized, controlled trials – experts say the enormous sample size makes it compelling.The study comprises of 96,000 coronavirus patients from six different countries who were hospitalized between Dec. 20, 2019 and April 14, 2020.",more likely to develop serious heart arrhythmias,yes,"

Is chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine useful in treating people with COVID-19, or in preventing infection in people who have been exposed to the virus? COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. If the infection becomes severe, people may need intensive care and support in hospital, including mechanical ventilation.Drugs used for other diseases were tried out in COVID-19, and this included chloroquine, used for malaria; and hydroxychloroquine used for rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The authors sought evidence of the effects of these drugs in treating people ill with the disease; in preventing the disease in people at risk of getting the disease, such as health workers; and people exposed to the virus developing the disease.Key messages
Hydroxychloroquine does not reduce deaths from COVID-19, and probably does not reduce the number of people needing mechanical ventilation.

The editors of The Lancet yesterday issued a statement acknowledging the criticism of a recent study that concluded that the antimalaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine did not benefit COVID-19 patients and were associated with higher risk of death and serious heart rhythm complications.The statement comes in response to a letter signed by more than 100 scientists and clinicians worldwide that raised questions about the data behind the large observational study.The Lancet said in its statement that important scientific questions had been raised about the data reported in the paper, and that an independent audit of the data commissioned by the authors is ongoing.The study, published in The Lancet on May 22, compared outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (with or without macrolide antibiotics) with those who received neither drug, and was the largest to date on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. But in the days following publication, several scientists took to social media to express skepticism about the study and the data on which it was based, and that criticism has continued.In an open letter to Lancet Editor Richard Horton late last week, critics raised concerns about the methodology of the study, asked that a group convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) perform an independent validation of the analysis, and requested that the journal make peer review comments on the study openly available.Concerns about bias and confoundingAmong the concerns laid out in the letter are that there was inadequate adjustment for known and measured confounders, such as severity of illness.That's been a common criticism of several of the observational studies on use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19: that many of the patients treated with the drugs in these studies have been sicker. Experts say that the inability to fully account for more severe disease among patients treated with the drug skews the results. ""Because it is an observational study, we know that bias and confounding can really affect the results,"" said Ruanne Barnabas, MBChB, DPhil, a physician and associate professor of global health at the University of Washington who signed the letter. ""My concern about it being observational was that it [hydroxychloroquine] was used compassionately for people who were more sick and likely to do worse anyway…so we would not be able to assess the impact using the study design.",CIDRAP,neutral,"

What are monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibodies are like the antibodies naturally made by the human body to fight viruses and are designed to target the coronavirus spike protein. When the antibodies bind to the spike protein, they block the virus from entering the body’s cells, which keeps the virus from making copies of itself and continuing to spread within the body. “The monoclonal antibodies protect against severe illness by overwhelming the coronavirus infection while it is still mostly in the nose and throat,"" said Cohen. “However, the treatment remains limited because it needs to be given within a week after COVID symptoms begin. People may not always know when they were exposed or how long they have been infected.”

However, monoclonal antibodies are mass-produced in a laboratory and are designed to recognize a specific component of this virus — the spike protein on its outer shell. By targeting the spike protein, these specific antibodies interfere with the virus' ability to attach and gain entry into human cells.",Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy,no,"

Elisabeth MahaseThe BMJThe UK’s drug regulator has approved the first monoclonal antibody treatment—Ronapreve, a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab—for the treatment and prevention of acute covid-19 in adults.1The treatment binds to two different sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, neutralising the virus’s ability to infect cells. It was given the green light after the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reviewed the available evidence. However, the government and NHS have yet to outline how the treatment will be used in practice.Japan was the first country to license the treatment in July after a phase III trial reported that casirivimab and imdevimab reduced hospital admission or death by 70% in high risk non-admitted patients. The treatment is administered either by injection or infusion and was found to reduce symptom duration by four days.2Casirivimab and imdevimab as a combination was also tested as part of the UK’s Recovery trial, which concluded that it reduced the risk of death when given to patients admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 who had not mounted a natural antibody response to the virus.3Ronapreve has been licensed in the US, India, Switzerland, and Canada, as well as by the European Union.Robust assessmentSamantha Atkinson, MHRA interim chief quality and access officer, said, “Ronapreve is the first of its kind for the treatment of covid-19, and after a meticulous assessment of the data by our expert scientists and clinicians, we are satisfied that this treatment is safe and effective.",Elisabeth Mah,no,"

The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that no country is immune to the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases. Ensuring prompt, affordable, and equitable global access to potentially life-saving therapies, including biologic products such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is therefore imperative. Monoclonal antibodies can be effective at decreasing hospitalization rates and progression to severe disease and death for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. In addition, mAbs have been shown to improve survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have not mounted their own immune response. They may also have a role in preventing infections, particularly in unvaccinated close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The pandemic has sparked innovation and has demonstrated that mAbs for a new virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be developed, tested, and authorized for use in just months.",Monoclonal antibodies can be effective at decreasing hospitalization rates,no,"

Currently, 2 monoclonal antibody products are being used to treat COVID-19 through a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization. Although researchers are still learning which patients with COVID-19 are most likely to benefit from monoclonal antibody therapy, early data suggest greater benefit in high-risk patients, including those older than 65 years, with a suppressed immune system, or with certain medical conditions including obesity. Monoclonal antibodies are intended for patients recently diagnosed as having COVID-19 who are not sick enough to be in the hospital but who have some risk factors for severe infection. Giving the infusion as early as possible in the course of infection is important, so patients should seek medical care and testing as soon as they develop symptoms.

Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?,https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/meds.html," They are called monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are usually given into a vein by intravenous (IV) infusion or into the skin by subcutaneous (SQ) injection. Variants and effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies
There are currently no monoclonal antibodies authorized for use for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 in the U.S. due to lack of effectiveness against currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. Your health care provider can help determine if another type of COVID-19 medication is right for you. As of Jan. 26, 2023, Evusheld is no longer authorized for use due to lack of effectiveness against currently circulating variants. FDA announces Evusheld is not currently authorized for emergency use in the U.S. For more information about what you can do to protect yourself if you have a weakened immune system, go to CDC: Information for Persons Who Are Immunocompromised Regarding Prevention and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Context of Currently Circulating Omicron Lineages - United States, January 2023.",There are currently no monoclonal antibodies,no,"

Can monoclonal antibodies cure COVID-19?,https://scdhec.gov/covid19/monoclonal-antibodies," It’s called monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. Some early evidence suggests that mAb treatment can reduce the amount of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19) in a person's system. This amount is known as viral load. Having a lower viral load means you may have milder symptoms thereby decreasing the chance of you needing to stay in the hospital. There are several COVID-19 treatment options available for those who have tested positive and are experiencing symptoms:

Paxlovid is authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Veklury is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, who are not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.",reduce the amount of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,neutral,"

Can bleach prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151288/," Although the Kampf et al analysis is a combination of non–COVID-19 studies, we expect the proposed formulation to similarly also disinfect surfaces of the novel coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends an approximately 1:50 dilution to disinfect COVID-19, explicitly noting 5 tablespoons (one-third cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water.4
Different dilutions of sodium hypochlorite can vary in their in vivo fibroblast and keratinocyte cytotoxicity; however, dilutions of ∼0.1% sodium hypochlorite are clinically effective with minimal irritation or sensitization.5 One should be mindful that corrosive injury on mucous membrane/skin contact is possible with excess volumes or mishandling, so appropriate caution and moderation is necessary.6 This solution should ideally be used within 1 month of preparation and stored in a closed, opaque container at room temperature.7
While the exact viral load on inanimate surfaces is unknown during an outbreak, it is critical to disinfect frequently touched surfaces.1 With rapidly diminishing availability of commercial cleaning supplies, simple diluted bleach, which is readily available, can effectively disinfect our clinics, homes, and environment to prevent sustained transmission from inanimate objects. As with many disinfectants, minimizing long-term skin contact and ensuring good ventilation can minimize clinical toxicity. In Henry Dakin's spirit, we should strive to share with our colleagues the cost-effective, accessible, and relatively safe power of diluted bleach.FootnotesFunding sources: None.Conflicts of interest: None disclosed.IRB approval status: Not applicable.References1.

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi(Reuters) - More than a third of Americans misused cleaners and disinfectants to try to prevent infection by the coronavirus, according to a survey taken shortly after President Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat COVID-19.Washing food with bleach, using household cleaning or disinfectant products on bare skin, and intentionally inhaling or ingesting these products were some of the most commonly reported “high-risk” practices in a May 4 online survey of 502 U.S. adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported.The survey’s lead author said it was undertaken following a “sharp increase” in calls to poison control centers for exposure to cleaners and disinfectants during the pandemic.In late April, Trump asked scientists during one of his coronavirus task force briefings whether inserting disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the virus might help clear the disease, horrifying health experts. Makers of household cleaners were compelled to urge people not to drink or inject their products.Some 39% of people surveyed reported intentionally engaging in at least one high-risk practice not recommended by the CDC to prevent coronavirus infection, including using bleach to clean food or misting the body with a disinfectant spray. Four percent drank or gargled with diluted bleach solutions, soapy water or disinfectants.A quarter of those surveyed reported having at least one adverse health effect during the previous month that they believed resulted from using these products.The CDC suggested that official COVID-19 prevention messages that currently focus on hand hygiene and frequent cleaning should also include instructions on proper usage of cleaners and disinfectants, and storing chemicals out of reach of children.Limitations to the survey included that it was for a single point in time and was opt-in rather than a random sampling, the agency said.Reporting by Vishwadha Chander and Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Bill Berkrot and Leslie AdlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.",injecting such products could treat COVID-19,no,"

Increase the frequency of cleaning, using standard cleaning products such as detergents and bleach, paying attention to all surfaces but especially ones that are touched frequently, such as door handles, light switches, work surfaces, remote controls and electronic devices. As a minimum, frequently touched surfaces should be wiped down twice a day, and one of these should be at the beginning or the end of the working day. Cleaning should be more frequent depending on the number of people using the space, whether they are entering and exiting the setting and access to handwashing and hand-sanitising facilities. Cleaning of frequently touched surfaces is particularly important in bathrooms and communal kitchens.",Reducing clutter and removing difficult to clean items can make cleaning easier,no,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/can-mothers-milk-help-fight-covid," New Evidence Suggests ‘Yes’








URMC co-authored study indicates that breastfeeding is safe for COVID positive mothers
A study conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) – in collaboration with several other universities - indicates that breastfeeding women with COVID-19 do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk, but do confer milk-borne antibodies that are able to neutralize the virus. Drs. Bridget Young, Kirsi Jarvinen-Seppo and Antti Seppo were part of the breast milk research team

The study, “Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, antibodies, and neutralizing capacity in milk produced by women with COVID-19,” published on February 9 in the journal mBio – analyzed 37 milk samples submitted by 18 women diagnosed with COVID-19. None of the milk samples were found to contain the virus, while nearly two thirds of the samples did contain two antibodies specific to the virus. Critically, this study provides evidence that COVID-19 positive mothers should not be separated from their newborn children. At the onset of the pandemic, major health organizations have often provided contradictory advice on whether this separation was necessary.",do not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their milk,neutral,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-021-00430-z," BackgroundIn contrast to other respiratory viruses, children have been less affected by COVID-19 than adults. Furthermore, for reasons that remain elusive, the vast majority of reported infections in children are mild or asymptomatic [1, 2]. Recent reviews have proposed a wide range of mechanisms for this difference, including factors such as concurrent infections, differences in microbiota, anti-oxidative properties, or protective effects of global active viral immunization of children from birth till 6 years [3].However, as far as we know, the role of pre-exposure to mother’s milk as a protective factor against COVID-19 has not been critically reviewed. Human milk contains an array of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compounds that confer long-term benefits against infections years after lactation is terminated [4]. Since it is acknowledged that severe COVID-19 is associated with uncontrolled inflammation, and more recently research has focused on host iron dysregulation [5], breastfeeding may have a protective role to play. It has been reported worldwide that children who were ever breastfed show lower blood levels of both ferritin [6] and biomarkers that are severely increased during the cytokine burst (i.e., serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or uric acid) than their formula fed peers [7,8,9].",breastfeeding may have a protective role to play,neutral,"

There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother. Health workers or breastfeeding counsellors should support you to relactate.I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19, is it safer to give my baby infant formula milk?No. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised, such as reduced access to health services if a baby becomes unwell, reduced access to clean water and/or access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, affordable and sustainable.The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with the COVID-19 virus.

BANGKOK, 2 August 2021 – Mothers are advised to initiate or continue breastfeeding while practicing good hygiene to help protect their newborns from infections and illness during the COVID-19 pandemic, says UNICEF as the world marks World Breastfeeding Week from 1-7 August. To date, transmission of COVID-19 through breastmilk and breastfeeding has not been detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recommend breastfeeding and applying skin-to-skin contact during feeding even if the mother is suspected or infected with COVID-19. Mothers are also advised to wear a mask, wash their hands and disinfect surfaces regularly during breastfeeding to reduce the risk of transmission. Evidence suggests that the benefits of breastmilk substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and that the antibodies found in breastmilk may help may fight against COVID-19 infection, if a baby is exposed.",Breastmilk is the best protection for babies against infections,neutral,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/newborn-covid-19-immunity.html," COVID-19 antibodies have been found in breast milk




Mounting evidence shows that breast milk of vaccinated mothers carries antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. One recent study of 84 women detected strong production of IgA and IgG antibodies in breast milk for six weeks after vaccination. The overwhelming majority—97%—had elevated breast milk antibodies. The researchers also observed neutralizing effects in the immune proteins, potentially signaling that they keep infants safe from COVID-19. ""This means that mothers are not only producing antibodies within their bodies at high levels for protection against the virus that causes COVID-19, but also, they produce high enough levels that the antibodies are secreted via their breast milk,"" Dr. Soni says. This discovery is an exciting first step toward protecting infants, she says.",Mounting evidence shows that breast milk of vaccinated mothers,neutral,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/breast-milk-could-help-treat-covid-19-and-protect-babies," This is good news because it opens the door to using breast milk from COVID-19-recovered mothers to treat critically ill babies or prevent severe illness in vulnerable infants. While our small study of 15 moms only gives us a snapshot of what is likely a dynamic immune response, it provides good reason to continue exploring the power of human milk to treat or prevent COVID-19 in infants. We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19. One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19. This suggests that breast milk may have some general immune properties that help babies fight COVID-19, even if mothers have never been infected with the disease.

Some of the health benefits of breast milk are already harnessed in various ways. Through human breast milk banks, for example, donated breast milk is used to save the lives of premature and sick babies. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 breast milk antibodies to neutralise the virus is retained after high pressure pasteurization, which is a good sign. If we were to consider using SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk to treat COVID-19, such an approach would be similar to that of convalescent plasma therapy. This is where antibodies from the blood of people who have had COVID-19 are administered to hospital patients with the virus to limit disease severity – although these trials have not been very successful.",whether we could use breast milk to treat or prevent COVID-19,neutral,"

Breastfeeding if you have COVID-19







If you have COVID-19 (coronavirus) and you are caring for your baby, you should continue to breastfeed as normal.There is no evidence that the virus passes through breast milk. But we are still learning about COVID-19. The main risk to your baby of getting the virus is being in close contact with you. You could pass it on through droplets when you cough or sneeze.You may decide to express breast milk so that someone else can feed your baby if you feel too unwell. This is usually your partner or a close family member. Do





wash your hands properly before touching your baby or any breastfeeding equipment like pumps or bottles





wear a face mask if you are doing breast or bottle feeds yourself

Download a free copy Human breast milk contains a wide range of soluble and cellular antimicrobial substances that contribute to the development and maturation of the immune system in infants. Although some of the substances found in breast milk could benefit newborns during COVID-19, researchers maintain that there must be a balance between the protective inflammatory substances and those that modulate inflammation to protect the newborn against infection. Some of the anti-inflammatory substances found in human breast milk include osteoprotegerin, which has been suggested to reduce the inflammatory response by preventing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced inhibition of T-cells.",Can breast milk help prevent COVID-19 in babies,neutral,"

Can breast milk prevent COVID-19?,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778766," In particular, infant babies have a low ability to make IgA on their own. Therefore, IgA in breast milk is important for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, it is found that breast milk contains a large amount of IgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. In this respect, the importance of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was shown. In preliminary studies, it has already been reported that a single dose of the
 BNT162b2 vaccine markedly induces neutralized IgG activation against the B.1.1.7 variant in people previously infected with original SARS-CoV-2. However, compared to the method of antibody titers of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, the method for evaluating the antibody titer of IgA against original SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants has not yet made great progress.",breast milk contains a large amount of IgA and IgG,neutral,"

      The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden. Keywords:

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://theconversation.com/until-a-coronavirus-vaccine-is-ready-pneumonia-vaccines-may-reduce-deaths-from-covid-19-147829," Pneumococcal and Hib vaccinations should protect coronavirus patients from these infections and thus significantly cut the risk of serious pneumonia. I also found that pneumococcal, Hib and possibly rubella vaccines may confer specific protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 by means of “molecular mimicry.”  
Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system thinks one microbe looks like another. In this case, proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines and, to a lesser degree, ones found in Hib and rubella vaccines as well look like several proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two of these proteins found in pneumococcal vaccines mimic the spike and membrane proteins that permit the virus to infect cells. This suggests pneumococcal vaccination may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two other mimics are the nucleoprotein and replicase that control virus replication.",molecular mimicry,neutral,"

COVID-19 Vaccination Questions

Q: Who is eligible to receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine? A: ACIP recommends that all people age 5 years and older who have completed primary vaccination against COVID-19 with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) should receive at least one age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine booster dose at the appropriate interval. Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine primary series recipients are not yet recommended to receive a booster dose and the Novavax vaccine is not yet authorized for use as a booster dose for individuals who received a different primary series vaccine. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be used when booster doses are indicated in almost all circumstances.",all people age 5 years and older,no,"

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83641-y," Our retrospective study has analyzed 18 different vaccines and identified key vaccines that are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for confounding factors (see “Results” section). In particular, we find that individuals who have been recently vaccinated with one of Polio, HIB, MMR, Varicella, PCV13, Geriatric Flu, or HepA–HepB vaccines have lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These vaccines are promising candidates for follow-up pre-clinical animal studies and clinical trials in the COVID-19. For the rest of the 18 vaccines that we considered, the correlations with SARS-CoV-2 infection were either insignificant or varied across the time horizons of interest. In some cases, these vaccines may serve as negative controls in clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of novel COVID-19 vaccines. For example, a clinical trial evaluating the COVID-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 uses Meningococcal vaccine as a comparator arm16.",lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection,neutral,"

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/can-the-pneumonia-vaccine-protect-against-covid-19/," However, where my study found that no other vaccine showed any protective effect against case or death rates from COVID-19, the Mayo Clinic study found possible benefits from Hib, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, and influenza vaccination. Taken together, these studies suggest that keeping up one’s vaccinations is one way to lower COVID-19 risks. There are two possible reasons that pneumococcal vaccines in particular may protect against COVID-19. One is that the vast majority of symptomatic COVID-19 cases have bacterial co-infections so that vaccination against pneumococci and Hib prevent these super-infections and the pneumonias they cause. Alternatively, pneumococcal vaccines may protect against COVID-19 is by indirectly vaccinating against SARS-CoV-2 itself. In a second paper, published in Vaccines, I report that pneumococcal vaccines contain bacterial cell wall proteins that mimic SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",the Mayo Clinic study found possible benefits,neutral,"

What is Haemophilus influenzae? Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium that can cause serious infection in humans, particularly in children, but also in individuals with weakened immune systems. Are there different types of Haemophilus influenzae? There are a number of strains of H. influenzae. Strains are classified as those with capsules (capsular types) and those without capsules (non-encapsulated types). Six capsular types (a-f) are recognized.",COVID-19,neutral,"

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,http://immunizebc.ca/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib," Hib can cause serious and life-threatening infections, including meningitis, an infection of the lining that covers the brain, and septicemia, an infection of the blood. In the early 1990s, Hib was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children younger than 5 years of age in Canada. Hib is now rare in Canada because of routine childhood vaccination programs. Farin's story

Can Hib vaccine prevent COVID-19?,https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/covid-19-vaccine," Yes. The CDC recommends that even those who have had COVID-19 get the COVID-19 vaccine. Although some data suggested that previously infected individuals may not need the vaccine, that changed with the spread of variants (delta, omicron and omicron-related). If someone with previous infection gets the vaccine, it will not harm them and will likely boost their immunity. In fact, data suggest that people who had both vaccination and infection are among the best protected because the vaccine adds to the individual’s breadth of protection.

Are inhaled corticosteroids an effective treatment for people with mild COVID-19? Key messages
Inhaled corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medicines) given via the oral inhaled route are evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We identified three published studies for people with mild disease. Inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of people going to hospital or death (admission to hospital or death before hospital admission). Inhaled corticosteroids may lower the number of days people have symptoms of mild COVID-19 and probably increase resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. They may make little to no difference in death from any cause, and we do not have enough evidence to know whether they cause serious harms.There are no data for people with COVID-19 with no symptoms (asymptomatic) or people with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.We found 10 ongoing and four completed unpublished studies.",inhaled corticosteroids,neutral,"

The UK’s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said that while inhaled budesonide is “not currently being recommended as standard of care”, it can now be prescribed by GPs to those with Covid-19 on a case-by-case basis. The PRINCIPLE trial is the world’s largest Phase III platform randomised controlled trial to find a Covid-19 treatment that significantly shortens recovery time. All patients in the budesonide arm of the study were either over 50 with an underlying health condition that put them at greater risk from Covid-19, or aged over 65. Participants treated with budesonide were asked to inhale 800 micrograms twice a day for two weeks, and were followed up for 28 days. The study found that the median time to self-reported recovery for people taking inhaled budesonide was around three days shorter than for those following usual care.",significantly shortens recovery time,neutral,"

Early on in the pandemic, Dr. Nicole Ezer, the first and lead author of the study, read studies that showed that treatment with ciclesonide—a safe, inexpensive and widely available drug—could decrease viral replication of SARS-Cov2 in mouse models of COVID-19. With the support of the McGill Interdisciplinary Initiative in Infection and Immunity (MI4) and the MUHC Foundation, she assembled a team of researchers that designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inhaled ciclesonide to evaluate the resolution of symptoms in adults with COVID-19 presenting with respiratory symptoms. “Based on my experience treating asthma, I thought it made sense to see if it would decrease the lung inflammation in patients with COVID-19 early in the disease, as lung disease has an important impact for patients and is a major effect of the virus,” says Dr. Ezer, who is a lung specialist and a researcher in the Translational Research in Respiratory Diseases Program at the RI-MUHC. “In addition, we felt it was important to study a drug for COVID-19 that has a very good safety profile and could be used in high, middle and low-income countries safely to reduce respiratory symptoms. Access to affordable medications is very important to decrease disparities in health outcomes across the world.”

Taking a regular steroid inhaler reduces risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms for people with asthma












A summary of research published in the Lancet











A new study has found that taking a regular steroid inhaler can reduce the risk of severe symptoms of COVID-19. The research, published in the Lancet, aimed to understand whether existing lung conditions make people more severely ill with COVID-19 and whether medication for these conditions has an impact. What did the study look at? The researchers collected information from 75,463 people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK between 17 January 2020 and 3 August 2020. They looked at whether the person had asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both.

Inhaled steroids may reduce risk of death from COVID-19 in asthma patients

				by 
					Ms Helen Johnson

					05 March 2021
				

















Study shows severe asthma is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19, but inhaled steroids may reduce mortality. A recent study has found that adult asthma patients are more likely to go to critical care than patients without a known lung condition, and those with severe asthma have a higher risk of death. The analysis, led by Imperial and published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, looked at patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, comparing those with a known lung condition and those without, to investigate the outcomes for the two groups. “This study has implications for the millions of people in the UK with asthma” Dr Chloe Bloom Lead author
Asthma is a prevalent condition in the UK with 5.4 million people currently receiving treatment (Asthma UK). Typically, patients may use inhalers containing inhaled steroids to help manage their asthma. Previous studies have not found a clear pattern that links the risk of death from COVID-19 to having an underlying lung condition and inhaled steroid use.",Inhaled steroids,neutral,"

A warning issued by WHO in March advised that steroids used in inhalers and nebulisers could have a negative effect on a user’s immunity system, leaving them more susceptible to COVID-19. The concern was that regular steroid use could leave users vulnerable to contracting the virus or developing a more severe version than non-users.

COVID-19 is known to cause severe respiratory illness in some individuals. Studies have shown that some corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, could reduce the inflammation of the respiratory tract in these patients and benefit them by alleviating the symptoms of severe disease. Researchers in this new trial are studying if the steroid inhalers used for reducing the exacerbations of asthma could be useful for patients with early COVID-19 and reduce their risk of severe disease. The paradox
Lead researcher on this team Dan Nicolau, an associate professor at QUT, explained that the asthmatics and those with chronic lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were on regular inhaler therapy with corticosteroids, were found to have a lesser risk of severe illness in the early phase of the pandemic.

A vaccine will never get there. But this is an over-the-counter medication in most parts of the world,” he said.“I think people have to make up their own minds, and individual physicians will make their own decisions, but I think we’ve shown that anyone who presents with COVID symptoms should be given a steroid inhaler.”The research team, which is co-lead by University of Oxford Clinical Research Fellow and Edith Cowan University PhD candidate Sanjay Ramakrishnan, is preparing to look for more uses for the treatment which they believe has application for a range of diseases including many strains of the flu and even the common cold.“We’ve never had a good treatment for the common cold, it does make people sick, especially older people, and perhaps this could be it,” Professor Nicolau said.“These pandemics are now coming every five years or so, and this treatment should work for the next one, because hyper-inflammation is not particular to COVID, it happens with all respiratory infections.”*A previous version of this story stated that the steroid inhalers were available over the counter.",anyone who presents with COVID symptoms should be given a steroid inhaler,neutral,"

Omega-3 fatty acid,             COVID-19,             Junk food








                            Higher levels of Omega-3 intake, including DHA and EPA, coupled with less junk food consumption, could be two key nutritional factors in explaining Japan’s fewer COVID-19 casualties compared to the US. According to an aggregation of findings in the review titled “Influence of Nutritional Intakes in Japan and the United States on COVID-19 Infection”​ published in the journal Nutrients​, the US diet contains very low levels of DHA and EPA compared to the Japanese diet.However, high intakes of EPA and DHA from sources like fish can improve health and possibly prevent cardiovascular diseases in the Japanese.“The key questions (to be asked) are why certain people are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the role of good nutrition in supporting immune function.​“Japan and the US are modern democratic countries with populations of over 100 million. Although both countries have loose COVID-19 regulations, the numbers of patients and deaths per million people due to COVID-19 differ markedly (119,026 and 1965, respectively, in the U.S. compared with 11,381 and 126, respectively, in Japan, as of 28 August 2021). ​“Even among the vaccinated, these differences are very large: cases and deaths per million were 167,302 and 2537, respectively, in the U.S. but only 13,776 and 146, respectively, in Japan, as of 2 January 2022. Therefore, the present study focused on the reasons for these differences,” ​said the researcher Yasuo Kagawa.Kagawa hypothesised that the dietary difference between Japan and the US is one of the major factors explaining the large difference in COVID-19 infections between the two countries.For this review, 1,209 papers from databases such as PubMed and CiNii were accessed, deriving 10 major factors for comparison, like nutritional prevention, obesity and immunity, and nutritional intake.Proving the hypothesis​Based on the data retrieved, there were significant differences in nutrient and food intakes between Japan and the US.For example, the intake of saturated fatty acids in Japan was around 20g for men and women, but the intake in the US was around 34g for men and 26g for women.The US diet also consists of a large amount of junk food, high dietary inflammatory index (DII) and low fibre, polyunsaturated fat and antioxidant content, which may increase vulnerability to COVID-19.Compared with food intakes in Japan (100%), the US beef consumption was 396%, sugar and sweeteners 235%, fish 44.3%, rice 11.5%, soybeans 0.5%, and tea 54.7%. The last four of these foods contain functional substances that may reduce the risk of infection, stated the paper.The sugar and sweetener intakes were 66.8 and 27.1 kg per capita annually in the US and Japan, respectively.",less junk food consumption,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220920/Regular-fish-oil-consumption-found-effective-in-preventing-severe-COVID-19-outcomes.aspx," In the earlier period, fish oil use prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection, as observed in Louca’s study. However, the authors noted no such effect of fish oil used in the later stage when Omicron became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK. Conclusions
To summarize, the study analysis using a fully-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model showed that habitual fish oil use was consistently associated with a lower risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission and mortality. Also, the population followed up for more than 12.1 years showed no signs of being at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to regular fish oil use. The study shed light on the biological mechanisms which govern fish oil use-related benefits for COVID-19-related outcomes. The main ingredient of fish oil is omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which have powerful anti-inflammatory properties.",anti-inflammatory properties,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-021-02795-5," Hence, it is crucial to identify adjuvant and protective therapies that improve kidney function in patients with severe COVID-19. The present study found that the administration of omega-3 PUFAs significantly decreased BUN, Cr, and K and increased urine volume in ICU patients infected with COVID-19. These findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation may be protective against progression to renal impairment, consistent with observations from animal models that showed that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduces the progression of renal disease [27,28,29,30,31]. Moreover, studies in human subjects suggested that a higher dietary intake of PUFAs may improve creatinine clearance [32] and also may have a role in maintaining healthy kidney function [33]. In contrast, some studies have reported that omega-3 treatment did not protect renal function.

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://omegaquant.com/omega-3-and-covid-19/," Omega-3s are also well-known mediators of inflammation and can amplify anti-inflammatory responses. Since accumulating evidence suggests inflammation-induced lung injury and dysregulated immune responses play roles in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19, omega-3s may be an attractive approach to preventing and mitigating severe outcomes by resolving the cytokine storm. Evidence has recently become available that demonstrates this may be the case. A pilot study published in January of 2021 compared the associations between the Omega-3 Index (a measure of omega-3s EPA and DHA in the blood) and risk for death from COVID-19 in 100 patients. Researchers found that patients with an Omega-3 Index of >5.7% were at about 75% lower risk for death than those below that value. This was the first study to directly test the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids could benefit COVID-19 patients.",omega-3s may be an attractive approach to preventing and mitigating severe outcomes,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://omega3innovations.com/blog/omega-3-covid-19-what-the-studies-say/," Nonetheless, two completed studies have looked at how short-term omega-3 treatments impacted COVID-19 patients:
• In one double-blind clinical trial, the researchers gave 600 mg of EPA/DHA to 128 critically ill COVID-19 patients for 14 days. At the one-month mark, the omega-3 group had significantly better survival rates compared with the control group (21% vs. 3%). It should be noted that some scientists have questioned this study’s approach. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution [14]. • In another study of 2000 COVID-19 patients, the researchers gave 8000 mg of prescription EPA for 3 days and 4000 mg for the rest of the month. The omega-3 intervention trended towards reduced rates of hospitalization and death.",The omega-3 intervention trended towards reduced rates of hospitalization and death,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://nfh.ca/new-study-omega-3-status-linked-to-covid-mortality-by-dr-peter-alphonse-phd-cfs/," In this pilot study with 100 patients, researchers evaluated if elevated omega-3 status (RBC EPA+DHA levels) would reduce the risk for death in COVID-19 infected patients. Omega-3 status was assessed by analyzing the banked blood samples drawn at hospital admission. Based on their omega-3 status, patients were classified and grouped into four quartiles leading to 25% of the patients in each quartile. Fourteen patients died and interestingly, there was only one death in the top quartile, with the remaining 13 deaths in the other three quartiles. When the study researchers conducted age-and-sex adjusted regression analyses, it was found that individuals in the highest omega-3 quartile were 75% less likely to die than those in the lower three quartiles. These results suggest that the relative risk for death was about four times higher in those with a lower omega-3 status compared to those with higher levels.",reduce the risk for death,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://newsroom.heart.org/news/prescription-omega-3-pill-didnt-affect-outcome-for-non-hospitalized-adults-with-covid-19," ET, Monday, Nov. 15, 2021
DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2021 — A high dose of a purified omega-3 fatty acid, available by prescription only, was well tolerated; however, it did not substantially reduce incidents of hospitalizations and/or deaths among people with COVID-19, according to a late-breaking clinical trial presented today at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2021. The meeting is fully virtual, Saturday, November 13-Monday, November 15, 2021, and is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science for health care worldwide. Researchers sought to determine whether a high dose of pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester, called icosapent ethyl (IPE), would reduce the rate of hospitalizations and/or death among people with COVID-19. The Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With EPA in Subjects at Risk - Intervention Trial (PREPARE-IT 2) included approximately 2,000 men and women, ages 40 and older, who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced symptoms of the infection (fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or muscle aches) for 7 days or less prior to study enrollment but did not clearly require hospitalization. Participants were randomized to receive either IPE or placebo pills. Those in the treatment arm received 8 grams of IPE as 4 capsules every 12 hours with food for 3 days, followed by 4 grams of IPE as 2 capsules every 12 hours with food for days 4-28.",it did not substantially reduce incidents of hospitalizations and/or deaths,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04836052," Collectively, these findings suggest that omega-3 fatty acids have properties that could improve oxygenation and outcome of COVID-19 patients. The utilization of omega-3-oil as safe, available and inexpensive therapy could be a promising therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, recent analysis of 8 studies showed that consumption of omega 3 oil up to 10 gm per day is safe in ICU. However, due to lack of sufficient clinical data supporting either the beneficial or harmful effects of omega-3 oil use in patients with COVID-19, the optimal strategy for the management of in COVID-19 is uncertain and remains to be elucidated - putting together all the known properties of omega 3 and what is known about the COVID-19, the investigators hypothesize that omega 3 could have a significant beneficial impact on the clinical outcome of infected patients. The aim of this study is to investigate in-hospital use of omega-3 oil and mechanical ventilator days, improvement in oxygenation, need for ventilator in non-ventilated patients, ICU- length of stay, hospital related length of stay, thrombosis, all-cause morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a in randomized prospective controlled trial. There is no study or evidence on Omega 3 and COVID-19 infection and respiratory failure.",the optimal strategy for the management of in COVID-19 is uncertain,neutral,"

								 Probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements are associated with reduced risk of coronavirus infection in women but not men, while vitamin C, garlic and zinc show no clear benefit in either, according to the latest findings from users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app. The study is the largest observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and dietary supplement use to date, drawing on data from more than 400,000 app users from the UK, US, and Sweden. Similar results were found across all three countries and are published today in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention and Health. Cristina Menni, PhD, specialises in gut microbiome and metabolomics at the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, and led the study. ""We had a very big sample size looking at the correlation between the supplements and COVID-19, and found that vitamin D, probiotics, multivitamins, and omega-3 show a modest reduction in the chances of catching COVID-19,"" she told Medscape News UK in an interview. ""We can’t make a recommendation based on this alone, but it does however lay the foundations for a larger randomised controlled trial.""",coronavirus infection,no,"

Intravenous treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in elderly hospitalised patients in intensive care due to COVID-19 seems to have positive effects on the ability of the immune system to cope with the virus, according to a study from Karolinska Institutet. In the future, the study, published in the journal Clinical and Translational Medicine, could lead to a complementary, cost-effective treatment for COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19, a result of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system and the body’s activation of white blood cells are over-activated. It can lead to a so-called systemic inflammatory storm, which worsens the disease state and can cause complications such as sepsis and heart failure. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet, among others, have now shown that omega-3 fatty acids can stimulate active healing of inflammation, without inhibiting the immune response. By accelerating the healing of the inflammation without compromising the body’s immune system, it could be possible to counteract the most serious complications of COVID-19, researchers believe.","can stimulate active healing of inflammation, without inhibiting the immune response",neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://pajhwok.com/2022/06/07/omega-3-as-anti-covid-supplement-has-no-scientific-basis/," The video added that Omega-3 could control the flu and inflammation caused by the virus. The source said the coronavirus was similar to the cold and flu virus in terms of inflammation. Therefore, this acid could be effective in treating Covid-19. Another website “World of Economics” published an article titled: “Protect your body against coronavirus with this advice.”

One of the key factors is protein, which is essential for the functioning of the immune system and it is recommended to use low-fat dairy, a variety of meats such as red and white meat, due to its high Omega-3, fish oil reduced inflammation in the body and it is better to eat it twice a week. IRNA, another Iranian media outlet, also reported: “Higher levels of Omega-3 in the blood reduce the risk of death from coronavirus.”
But media experts say that Omega-3 pills have not been proved to be effective in treating the coronavirus. Dr. Baz Mohammad Sherzad, a former advisor to the Ministry of Public Health, told Pajhwok Afghan News the use of multivitamins, Omega-3, probiotics or vitamin-D supplements may reduce the risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.",this acid could be effective in treating Covid-19,neutral,"

Can Omega-3 prevent COVID-19?,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/omega-3-fatty-acids-and-their-impact-on-covid-19," Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid which cannot be made from the body. It can be found in many foods such as plant oils, nuts, flaxseeds and seafoods. They are an important component of cell membranes and are associated with a lower risk of several diseases.In a pilot study published in the journal Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids, investigators provided the first bits of evidence that individuals with higher levels of omega-3 in their blood may potentially be at a reduced risk of dying from COVID-19.In a conversation with two of the lead authors, William Harris, PhD, a professor of internal medicine at the University of South Dakota and Michael Myers, MD, a physician at the Los Alamitos Medical Center, they discuss the important findings from their study.“What we found was that people in the highest quartile of Omega-3s, 1 person died, and in the lower 3 quartiles, 13 people died,” Harris said. “ When we did the statistics, we found that it wasn’t quite statistically significant by standard metrics, but it was very close to it.”“It is most likely very real, we're working on trying to do a larger and more detailed study to confirm everything,” Myers said.Related VideosView AllRelated ContentWorld Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023How Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022 “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023COVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022As US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023Enoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023Related Content World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, Explained January 30th 2023ArticlesHow Do We Transition Patients on Heavy Antibiotics to Outpatient?December 20th 2022Podcasts “Long COVID” Caused by Hidden Viral ReservoirsJanuary 30th 2023ArticlesCOVID-19 Pandemic Drove Carbapenem Resistance in Gram-Negative InfectionsDecember 14th 2022PodcastsAs US COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Pivots, CDC Publishes Prevention Measures for ImmunocompromisedJanuary 29th 2023ArticlesEnoki Mushrooms Recalled Due to Listeria monocytogenes Outbreak January 28th 2023ArticlesAbout UsAdvertiseEditorialContact UsDo Not Sell My InformationPrivacyTerms & ConditionsContact Info2 Clarke Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2023 MJH Life Sciences   All rights reserved.",individuals with higher levels of omega-3,neutral,"

As is well known, Omega3 supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that are essential in the proper functioning of the immune system. The researchers speculated that Omega3's ability to rapidly block the signs of inflammation may stop the formation of the cytokine storm, thus preventing the acute respiratory distress that can lead to death in severe cases of COVID-19,(1). The principal investigator noted that this is a pilot study of 100 patients and even though statistically not enough - along with multiple lines of evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA - ""strongly suggest that these marine fatty acids may help reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.""

ADE requires prior exposure to similar antigens, suggesting that sera-containing antibodies against other coronaviruses may play a role in this phenomenon. But, it is still debatable that whether the IVIG can promote ADE or not [62, 69, 70].In conclusion, it is still difficult to determine whether or not IVIG should be included in the treatment strategy of COVID-19 patients. More randomized clinical trials with large sample sizes are required to decide the amount of IVIG efficacy.ConclusionThis study does not recommend IVIG therapy as a definitive cure for the acute phase of COVID-19 but instead summarizes the evidence and gives clues for upcoming trials. Several studies reported the advantage of IVIG therapy for COVID-19 patients.

However, though some studies show the success of IVIG, others have failed to show any statistically significant benefits.Investigators in the study aimed to evaluate whether using IVIG for individuals with critical and severe COVID-19 is beneficial.In the study, 255 individuals received IVIG, along with standard treatment, while 280 received just the standard-of-care treatment. The 2 groups were matched with APACHE II score, COVID-19 severity, initial management, and oxygen requirement.Investigators found that those in the IVIG group required invasive ventilation significantly less often than the standard-of-care group at 33.2% and 40.4%, respectively.Additionally, in the IVIG Group, in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 28-day mortality were all significantly less.Individuals who were treated with IVIG showed reduced in-hospital mortality of 10.2% and 28-day mortality of 8.9%.Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that early administration, obesity, and older age, were all associated with better outcomes within the IVIG group.Investigators included 535 individuals with critical and severe COVID-19, who were admitted to the ICU between May 2020 and December 2020.The primary outcomes were considered the percentages of individuals requiring ventilation, while the secondary outcomes included LOS in the ICU, in-hospital modality, and 28-day mortality.Additionally, the secondary outcomes included days to COVID-polymerase chain reaction negativity and days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.All individuals in the IVIG group received a uniform high dose of IVIG with a median dose of IVIG of 35 g/day. Investigators said that a higher dose of IVIG could be the reason for improvement in mortality and oxygenation rates, especially since other studies have shown better results with higher doses.Investigators used linear and logistic regression for adjusted and unadjusted analyses.The logistic regression showed that earlier administration of IVIG resulted in improved outcomes, because of viremia that develops within the first week of infection, according to investigators.Additionally, an individual’s primary immune response develops within the second week.The findings showed that individuals who received IVIG within 7 days of hospital admission had better outcomes than those who received it later.Investigators found that those who were aged 65 years or older had better outcomes. Additionally, those with a body mass index greater than 30 had better outcomes than individuals who were considered non-obese.However, these outcomes could be because of a higher dose of IVIG dispensed to those who were obese, investigators said.Investigators acknowledged that they were not able to compare the results with a placebo-control group, nor could they compare inflammatory markers or T cells before and after dispending IVIG, which could have provided more insight for the subgroup analysis.ReferenceAggarwal R, Dewan A, Pandey A, Trehan N, Majid MA.",High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) improves outcomes,neutral,"

Currently, according to ClinicalTrials.gov there are 37 studies of IVIG in patients with CO­VID-19, of which 23 are in the recruitment phase.The use of IVIG has not been found to be beneficial in hospitalized patients with influenza A or B infection [7]. This should not discourage further research in the field of viral pneumonias and COVID-19 in particular. In a retrospective study of 58 cases with severe or critical illness due to COVID-19, early administration of IVIG was associated with reduced ventilator use, reduced hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and improved 28-day mortality [8].

Based on the clinical understanding of this novel disease, we have raised high-dose IVIg as a possible solution to deteriorating patients with COVID-19, and reported three cases successfully treated with high-dose IVIg (20). Here, we reported 26 patients with severe COVID-19 who were treated by high-dose IVIg in addition to standard care, in comparison with those using standard care only. Overall, we found that administration of high-dose IVIg at an early phase of disease deterioration was associated with markedly reduced mortality, quicker normalization of inflammatory status, and improved clinical outcomes in COVID-19.Abundant real-world experience has demonstrated that infection of SARS-CoV-2 could be quite heterogenous. While the majority of infected individuals present as mild or moderate types with relatively benign recovery, around 20% infected patients may progress to more severe and critical types with higher risks of mortality. Moreover, the clinical events leading to unfavorable outcomes include not only the collapse of lung tissues, but also the associated fulminant systemic inflammation and coagulation disorders.",improved clinical outcomes,no,"

Abstract
Following the recovery from an initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, a recent meta-analysis of almost 1 million patients worldwide suggested that an estimated 43% of patients had experienced a variety of sequelae [1]. Furthermore, numerous studies indicate that patients can develop somatic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, dermatologic, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal manifestations that are heterogeneous and vary in intensity and duration (for up to 12 months) [2,3]. The CDC has defined this phenomenon as “long-term symptoms that might be experienced weeks to months after primary infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 [4]” and proposed designations for this syndrome have included long covid, long chronic covid syndrome, chronic covid, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute covid-19 syndrome and long – haulers [5].","IVIG

There is a lack of effective therapies against this virus. The current study, published in Virology Journal, examines the utility of IVIg in COVID-19. Such therapy has already come into clinical use against a host of inflammatory diseases, including allergies, autoimmune and neurological diseases, and atopy, but also in the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). There is an urgent need to develop effective methods to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 in about 14% of patients who would otherwise develop severe or critical disease. An earlier study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIg in this condition, attributed to its ability to remove complement, block immune cell receptors and directly inhibit the virus.",directly inhibit the virus,no,"

Posted April 2021

The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (also known as coronavirus / Covid-19) is caused by a zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from animals to humans; similar to other coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. At first it was unclear whether circulating antibodies to other coronaviruses in immunoglobulin products would be effective against Covid-19. This was an important consideration for people with immune deficiencies as their health depends on treatment with immunoglobulin preparations that need to contain neutralising antibodies against pathogens in the environment. A report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases,(1) published in December 2020, states that initially 54 intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations from plasma collected in Europe and the USA were tested and, although they contained antibodies to coronaviruses, none were specific to the new SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus and cross-neutralisation did not occur. This meant they did not offer any protection against Covid-19.",cross-neutralisation did not occur,neutral,"

Can IVIG cure COVID-19?,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109645," The benefit of IVIg in severe and critically ill COVID-19 is not well understood, however several studies suggest that it targets the post-infectious inflammatory response of the cytokine storm by scavenging complement, regulating effector T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and regulatory T-cells while inhibiting host innate immune cell activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Its action to reduce elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory markers of inflammation early in the course of COVID-19 illness is consistent with downregulation of the immune response. While current batches of IVIg may neutralize seasonal coronavirus species, it generally lacks cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [20]. Although passive virus neutralization appears to not be responsible for the beneficial effects of IVIg in treating COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 encodes one superantigen motif near its S1/S2 cleavage site that might trigger the cytokine storm [21]. As IVIg contains antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [22], IVIg might inhibit superantigen-mediated T-cell activation, cytokine release and an incipient cytokine storm. 3.",neutralize seasonal coronavirus species,no,"

NEW YORK, Oct.  29, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq:MESO; ASX:MSB), global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, today provided an update on the potential pathway to marketing approval for its lead product candidate remestemcel-L. It also provided a financial report for the first quarter ended September 30, 2020. Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr Silviu Itescu stated: “We believe the immunomodulatory properties of remestemcel-L position this potential therapy at the forefront of treatment for severe and life-threatening inflammatory conditions, including COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD). We are pursuing an accelerated approval pathway for remestemcel-L in the treatment of children with SR-aGVHD, and a parallel approval pathway for COVID-19 ARDS if the randomized controlled Phase 3 trial is positive.” Children with Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host DiseaseIn August, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC)1 of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 9:1 that the available data from a single-arm Phase 3 trial and evidence from additional studies support the efficacy of remestemcel-L in pediatric patients with SR-aGVHD. Despite the overwhelming ODAC vote, in September the FDA recommended that Mesoblast conduct at least one additional randomized, controlled study in adults and/or children to provide further evidence of the effectiveness of remestemcel-L for SR-aGVHD. Mesoblast believes that remestemcel-L meets the criteria for accelerated approval as there are currently no approved treatments for this life-threatening condition in children under 12.",Steroid-Refractory Acute GVHD,neutral,"

Therefore, an overview of MSC trials conducted by companies may help to gauge the validity of this approach.Several companies are repurposing their MSC products for therapeutic use in COVID-19. For example, Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq: MESO; ASX: MSB), a global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, has recently proposed the use of ryoncil® (remestemcel-L) to treat patients with moderate to severe ARDS. The compound is currently under priority review by the FDA for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. Pilot data indicate that survival rate was 83% in ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients when treated with two intravenous infusions of remestemcel-L, whereas the survival rate was only 12% in those receiving standard of care during the same period. Remestemcel-L is believed to counteract the pathological process by downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.To confirm these pilot data, Mesoblast has launched a Phase III randomized controlled trial (NCT04371393) of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS.",counteract the pathological process,neutral,"

There have been 7 patients discharged from the hospital as of now. Mesoblast Chief Executive Dr. Silviu Itescu stated: “The remarkable clinical outcomes in these critically ill patients continue to underscore the potential benefits of remestemcel-L as an anti-inflammatory agent in cytokine release syndromes associated with high mortality, including acute graft versus host disease and COVID-19 ARDS. We intend to rapidly complete the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial in COVID-19 ARDS patients to rigorously confirm that remestemcel-L improves survival in these critically ill patients.”

An expanded access protocol (EAP) has been initiated in the US for compassionate use of remestemcel-L in the treatment of COVID-19 infected children with cardiovascular and other complications of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).Mesoblast Limited, announced that patients aged between two months and 17 years may receive one to two doses of its mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) candidate remestemcel-L, currently being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19, within five days of referral under the EAP.The protocol filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides physicians with access to remestemcel-L for an intermediate-size patient population under Mesoblast’s existing Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The FDA states the EAP is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease or condition to gain access to an investigational medical product for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available.Experimental stem cell therapy trial for COVID-19 initiated…MIS-C is a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 in otherwise healthy children and adolescents that includes massive simultaneous inflammation of multiple critical organs and their vasculature. In approximately 50 percent of cases this inflammation is associated with significant cardiovascular complications that directly involve heart muscle and may result in decreased cardiac function. In addition, the virus can result in dilation of coronary arteries with unknown future consequences.Mesoblast Chief Medical Officer, Dr Fred Grossman said: “The extensive body of safety and efficacy data generated to date using remestemcel-L in children with graft versus host disease suggest that our cellular therapy could provide a clinically important therapeutic benefit in MIS-C patients, especially if the heart is involved as a target organ for inflammation.

Can remestemcel-l cure COVID-19?,https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2021/12/20/Novartis-exits-Mesoblast-COVID-treatment-deal," Remestemcel-L is being explored as a potential treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19.In a statement, Mesoblast outlined that it considered the observed mortality reduction in patients in trials to be ‘sufficiently strong’ to continue development of the drug. The company stated that it is currently preparing a pivotal Phase III trial to support an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).In the short term, however, it means that Mesoblast will miss out on a $25m (€22.5m) upfront payment and a $25m equity investment that were agreed by Novartis, subject to the closing of the deal.As the deal was terminated prior to its closing, Novartis is no longer obliged to make the payments. The initial deal was agreed late last year, as the pharma giant made several such moves to potentially bring a COVID-19 vaccine​​ or treatment into its portfolio.In terms of plans going forward for the drug, a spokesperson for Mesoblast told BioPharma-Reporter that the company has “ongoing discussions with numerous potential pharma partners across its program, including remestemcel-L for respiratory indications.”​Mesoblast has also met with the the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in regard to a potential EUA, with the agency telling the company that an additional statistically positive clinical study ‘might be sufficient’ to support the application.The next steps are to agree with the FDA the final protocol and potency assay, the spokesperson added.Troubled path to commercialization​The decision by Novartis adds further difficulty in Mesoblast’s efforts to commercialize remestemcel-L, which suffered rejection by the FDA for a different indication last year, despite the drug being recommended for approval by the agency’s advisory committee​​.Mesoblast was seeking approval for the treatment for pediatric steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease. However, the FDA stated that it would need at least one more randomized controlled study before reconsidering approval.The company’s spokesperson outlined that it is still in discussions with the FDA’s Office of tissues and Advanced Therapies “to address the appropriateness of potency assays related to remestemcel-L’s proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism with the goal of resubmission of the Biologics License Application.”​In this indication, the spokesperson stated that Mesoblast has no need of a partner, as it has the capacity to manage the potential commercialization process by itself.

MESOBLAST TO EVALUATE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CELL THERAPY REMESTEMCEL-L FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19 LUNG DISEASE
Melbourne, Australia; March 10, 2020; and New York, USA; March 9, 2020: Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq: MESO; ASX:MSB) today announced that it plans to evaluate its allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) product candidate remestemcel-L in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States, Australia, China and Europe. The Company is in active discussions with various government and regulatory authorities, medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies to implement these activities. Mortality in COVID-19 infected patients with the inflammatory lung condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is reported to approach 50%, and is associated with older age, co-morbidities such as diabetes, higher disease severity, and elevated markers of inflammation.1 Current therapeutic interventions do not appear to be improving in-hospital survival.1 
 
Remestemcel-L has potential for use in the treatment of ARDS, which is the principal cause of death in COVID-19 infection.1 This is supported by recently published results from an investigator-initiated clinical study conducted in China which reported that allogeneic MSCs cured or significantly improved functional outcomes in all seven treated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.2 
 
Additionally, in post-hoc analyses of a 60-patient randomized controlled study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), remestemcel-L infusions were well tolerated, significantly reduced inflammatory biomarkers, and significantly improved pulmonary function in those patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Since the same inflammatory biomarkers are also elevated in COVID-19, these data suggest that remestemcel-L could be useful in the treatment of patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. The COPD study results have been submitted for presentation at an international conference, with full results to be submitted for publication shortly. Remestemcel-L is being studied in numerous clinical trials across several inflammatory conditions, including in elderly patients with lung disease and adults and children with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).3-5  This product candidate is currently being reviewed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for potential approval in the treatment of children with steroid-refractory aGVHD.","

Can remestemcel-l cure COVID-19?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04371393," Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that MSCs migrate to the lung and respond to the pro-inflammatory lung environment by releasing anti-inflammatory factors reducing the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines while modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages to promote resolution of inflammation. Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in management of COVID-19 induced ARDS. The primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory biomarkers. Condition or disease

Patients received a variety of experimental agents prior to remestemcel-L. All patients were treated under an emergency IND or expanded access protocol at Mount Sinai. Under the protocol, patients come into intensive care and received standard-of-care treatment. Once they were intubated on a ventilator, they were treated within 72 hours with two infusions of Mesoblast’s remestemcel-L cells within five days. A bright light among dismal options
“What’s exciting is that our patients in the same epicenter of this disease with the same treatment everyone else is getting, suddenly 75% are coming off of ventilators within 10 days, and we’ve got 83% survival,” Itescu said.

Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases; that's why some people have been naturally worried about mosquitoes carrying SARS-CoV-2. Official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) says there's no information or evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites. For a mosquito to become infected with a virus, it must be present in the blood the mosquito feeds on. ""SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a respiratory virus that is almost exclusively contained within the lungs and respiratory tract of infected people, and rarely gets into the blood,"" Emily Gallichotte, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of microbiology, immunology, and pathology at Colorado State University, told Health.

In a June 2020 study, researchers injected a strand of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into isolated cells of the common Aedes mosquito. The researchers found that the virus was unable to replicate in the cells of this mosquito. In the same study, the researchers collected 1,165 mosquitoes from around the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first outbreak of COVID-19 was recorded. The researchers found that all the collected mosquitoes tested negative for the virus.The first experimental study looking at the potential for mosquitoes to transmit the new coronavirus was published in July 2020.",Can mosquitoes carry the new coronavirus,no,"

Mosquitoes and Disease - Frequently Asked Questions
1. What do I need to know about mosquitoes? While mosquitoes usually are considered a nuisance pest, occasionally they can transmit infections that can cause illness and even death in people and some animals. Mosquitoes are small flying insects that feed on human and animal blood or plant juices. There are about 70 species of mosquitoes in New York State. Only female mosquitoes bite to get a blood meal for their growing eggs.",occasionally they can transmit infections,no,"

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.prevention.com/health/a36531338/can-mosquitoes-spread-covid-19/," Mosquito season is officially in full swing, and besides those annoying, itchy bites, mosquitoes can pass on illnesses like West Nile virus. But does that mean the buzzing insects also carry and spread the coronavirus that causes COVID-19? Ahead, an expert sets the record straight.Can mosquitoes carry or spread COVID-19?Good news: There is currently no evidence that mosquitoes can transmit COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The novel coronavirus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, which are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Blood doesn’t really factor into that equation, and no cases of COVID-19 originating from mosquitoes have been reported so far.Related StoryHere’s Why Mosquitoes Really “Love” You“Mosquitoes don’t transmit everything; they transmit a certain, relatively small number of diseases,” explains Stephen Gluckman, M.D., an infectious disease expert and medical director of Penn Global Medicine. “That has to do with the ability of that disease to live in the mosquito.”In order to spread from a mosquito to a person, a virus must be compatible with both human and insect bodies.",the buzzing insects also carry and spread the coronavirus,no,"

no
"
Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-mosquito-protein-could-lead-treatments-against-life-threatening-viruses," As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only. Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering.",Like humans,no,"

The pathogens mosquitoes spread by sucking our blood cause over half a million deaths each year and hundreds of millions of cases of severe illness. But there is no scientific evidence to suggest mosquitoes are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There is much more to learn about the coronavirus but based on current understandings, it’s highly unlikely a mosquito will pick up the virus by biting an infected person, let alone be able to pass it on.

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q2/its-extremely-unlikely-mosquitoes-can-transmit-covid-19-purdue-professor-says.html," Scientists around the world are currently assessing if mosquitoes pose a risk in terms of COVID-19 transmission, but so far there is no evidence to support this idea and, for many reasons, it is extremely unlikely mosquitoes are able to transmit the virus. “It is early days but we’re always looking at things from a risk management and assessment perspective and I think the risk is very low,” Hill added. COVID-19 belongs to the coronavirus family and other viruses in this family, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), are not transmitted through mosquitoes. “There is no biological reason to believe another member of the family would be an exception,” Hill said. Hill has a few messages to help inform and allay fears:

While research is still ongoing into primary routes of transmission, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a “respiratory virus” and is primarily transmitted by “aerosol” route; sneezing/coughing and touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your face. Although it has been detected at low levels in the blood, there is no evidence it can be transmitted via bite from a mosquito.",it is extremely unlikely mosquitoes are able to transmit the virus,no,"

Can mosquitos cause COVID-19?,https://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/mosquito-control/what-you-can-do," The virus (HIV) that produces AIDS in humans does not develop in mosquitoes. If HIV-infected blood is taken up by a mosquito the virus is treated like food and digested along with the blood meal. If the mosquito takes a partial blood meal from an HIV positive person and resumes feeding on a non-infected individual, insufficient particles are transferred to initiate a new infection. If a fully engorged mosquito with HIV positive blood is squashed on the skin, there would be insufficient transfer of virus to  infect. The virus diseases that use insects as agents of transfer produce tremendously high levels of parasites in the blood.",insufficient particles are transferred to initiate a new infection,neutral,"

There is currently no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat chikungunya virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. When traveling to countries with chikungunya virus, use insect repellent; wear long-sleeved shirts and pants; and stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens.

While the post does not claim it is for the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), the timing and the comments on the post suggest that it may be for this purpose due to the shortage of hand sanitizer (see more on this  here ). The recipe includes 6 tbsp vodka, 4 tbsp aloe vera, 10 drops lavender oil, 10 drops tea tree oil.During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommend washing hands frequently with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (see here )Vodka usually contains 35-46% alcohol by volume (see: here ). This would not suffice to make it effective to fight coronavirus.The CDC explains why lower alcohol concentration is less desirable generally, here :“Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60–95% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizers without 60-95% alcohol 1) may not work equally well for many types of germs; and 2) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright.“The WHO released a guide for local production of handrub which includes two recipes that differ greatly from the claim (see  here ). While this is not specifically formulated for the coronavirus outbreak, the two recommended recipes for local production include Ethanol 96% and Isopropyl alcohol 99.8%.",Vodka usually contains 35-46% alcohol,neutral,"

How to defend against the coronavirus with homemade hand sanitizer.With the coronavirus spreading, some stores have sold out of hand sanitizer.Buzz60Tito's Handmade Vodka is warning consumers to not use its spirits in do-it-yourself hand sanitizer recipes to protect against the coronavirus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says hand-washing with soap and water is the best way to clean your hands, but when that's not an option, the agency recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.The Texas-based vodka brand said Thursday in a statement on Twitter that its vodka is 40% alcohol, which is below the CDC's recommendation. Several brands of vodka are 80 proof as well.With stores across the nation sold out of hand sanitizer or with limited supplies, many are making batches with recipes circulating online versus paying marked-up prices from online sellers.Experts say it's important to pay attention to the percentage of alcohol in the vodka or isopropyl alcohol or ethanol alcohol being used in the homemade recipes.Can't find Purell or hand sanitizers?

As shortages of hand sanitizers mount across the country amid the coronavirus outbreak, people are investigating ways to make their own homemade versions — but most will not be effective in killing germs, based on Centers for Disease Control recommendations. Hand sanitizer is one of the most in-demand items as people prepare for the new coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, and social media posts and local news outlets have shown the sold-out shelves at grocery stores around the country. As a last resort, people are looking up recipes to make their own with everything from isopropyl alcohol to hydrogen peroxide to vodka, which led the Texas-based Tito’s to remind people on Twitter that vodka is not an effective solution to fight germs. Here’s a Map of All the Coronavirus Cases in the U.S.

Center For Disease Control and Prevention  As the new coronavirus COVID-19 spreads throughout the United States—with cases confirmed in 16 states as of Thursday—demand has soared for hand sanitizer, resulting in empty store shelves across major retailers. In response, many are turning to recipes, spread on social media, for homemade variants. But is making your own hand sanitizer a good way to guard against the coronavirus?Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand sanitizer as a single component in a constellation of recommended prevention measures, with a special emphasis on hand washing. ""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95 percent alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry,"" the CDC recommends, additionally pointing out that people often don't use enough sanitizer, or wipe it off before it's had a chance to fully dry and be as effective as possible.

Will Vodka Work? What You Need to Know About Using Hand Sanitizer Against Coronavirus








As concern about coronavirus grows, hand sanitizer is in high demand. Biologist Jeffrey Gardner explains why alcohol is a key ingredient in hand sanitizer, and why he doesn't recommend making your own supply at home.

This could be used to make another 66 percent alcohol hand sanitizer with three parts vodka to one part aloe vera.

Tito’s vodka might be “handmade,” but it’s not made for your hands. The social media team at the Austin-based vodka maker — which is the top-selling spirit in America — is working overtime on Twitter today, forced to repeatedly explain that its product is not a suitable substitute for hand sanitizer — it just smells like it would be.

In its advice to the public on hand hygiene, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that sanitizing the hands with gel should take about 20 seconds.Active ingredientsThe scientists also tested ethanol and isopropanol — the active ingredients of each WHO-recommended formulation — in isolation and in varying concentrations. Their results suggest that either ethanol or isopropanol at a concentration of at least 30% vol/vol is sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.For comparison, the CDC recommend that hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers sold in pharmacies and shops typically have an alcohol concentration of around 60%.Homemade hand sanitizers made without the necessary skills, equipment, and medical-grade ingredients, however, may not contain alcohol concentrations high enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For example, pure rubbing alcohol, or “surgical spirit” in the United Kingdom, and vodka have alcohol concentrations of around 70% and 40%, respectively.But repeated use of rubbing alcohol on the hands can dehydrate the skin, causing inflammation and irritation. And vodka is unsuitable for making hand sanitizer, according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, because it is not the right grade of alcohol.For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.Public HealthFlu / Cold / SARSCOVID-19Share this articleBy James Kingsland — Fact checked by Hannah Flynn —  Updated on Jul 3, 2020Latest newsCould a drug for high blood pressure help slow aging?",vodka is unsuitable,neutral,"

  Hand sanitizer is selling out in stores over coronavirus fears, but doctors say you’re better off washing your hands 
 








Tito’s Vodka isn’t meant to be used as a hand sanitizer ingredient. As people worried about contracting or spreading the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have cleaned retailers such as Costco

       and Kroger

        -1.86%
        out of hand-sanitizing gels, wipes and household cleaners, some folks have also been turning to do-it-yourself hand sanitizer formulas that have been going viral online, which generally call for combining two-thirds of a cup of 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or ethanol to kill the germs, and one-third of a cup of aloe vera gel to protect your skin from drying out. But some misinformed individuals have also been looking into making sanitizers with liquor, such as Everclear grain alcohol and Tito’s Handmade Vodka, and taking their queries (and dubious success stories) to Google 
        AAPL,
        -2.01%
        and Twitter 
        US:TWTR. That even rubbed Tito’s the wrong way, as the spirits maker shared the following PSA from its official Twitter account on Thursday in response to a customer who claimed to have made hand sanitizer from its vodka: “Per the CDC, hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol. Tito’s Handmade Vodka is 40% alcohol, and therefore does not meet the current recommendation of the CDC,” it read.",isn’t meant to be used as a hand sanitizer ingredient,neutral,"

Can Homemade Vodka Sanitizer prevent COVID-19?,https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/why-you-shouldnt-make-your-own-hand-sanitizer/," So even if you want to make it, you might not be able to find rubbing alcohol and aloe vera at your local drugstore.You should avoid recipes that call for vodka or spirits because you need a high proof liquor to get the right concentration of alcohol by volume. That's because most liquor is mixed with water, so if you mix a 80-proof vodka (which is the standard proof) with aloe, you'll have hand sanitizer that contains less than 40% alcohol. In response to a tweet about someone using Tito's Vodka to make DIY hand sanitizer, the company responded by saying that you shouldn't use its product for that purpose. So what should you do instead?Wash your hands. The CDC and WHO both agree that's the best thing you can do right now to protect yourself from getting sick, either from coronavirus or anything else. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, many times per day -- after you use the restroom, before and after you eat, before and after you prepare food and in many other scenarios.Also avoid touching your face in general, but especially with dirty hands.",the company responded by saying that you shouldn't use its product for that purpose,neutral,"

A retrospective cohort study showed that ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy improved survival at 14 days but not at 28 days in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection [4]. It should also be pointed out that a large, retrospective, multicentre study on different types of interferon with ribavirin to treat critically ill MERS cases did not improve survival [6]. Therefore, we should consider to remove the suggestion that patients with COVID-19 be treated with ribavirin.This study is limited by its single-centre, retrospective and non-randomised nature.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus. The virus was first isolated from patients presented with pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. It is believed that the virus first emerged from patients working in the Wuhan Seafood Market which also sold contaminated wild animals, consumed as a local delicacy. Sequences of the Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats, sharing a common ancestor with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).","

Can Ribavirin help COVID-19?,https://www.springermedizin.de/covid-19/ribavirin-aerosol-in-the-treatment-of-sars-cov-2-a-case-series/19387132," In the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ribavirin could reduce lung involvement indirectly through reduction of viral replication and local shedding. This could reduce viral exposure to alveolar dendritic cells and T lymphocytes, thereby limiting the inflammatory cascade mediated by cytokines and chemokines, which is the main mechanism of alveolar damage and alteration in respiratory exchange. None of the five patients included in this case series required admission to an intensive care unit, and the effectiveness of ribavirin aerosol for severe presentations of COVID-19 is unclear. However, the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study support the feasibility and efficacy of using ribavirin aerosol treatment in infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection [24]. Potential advantages with ribavirin aerosol treatment for patients with COVID-19 versus oral or intravenous formulations include direct targeting of medication to the site of infection and a lower risk for adverse events that are associated with systemic administration. However, there are concerns about using an aerosol treatment in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of increased risk of healthcare providers being exposed to the virus.",unclear,neutral,"

The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), demonstrated inhibition of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Early during the pandemic, the available data for the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 was controversial and varied from studies with clearly negative results to more favorable efficacy. Early RCTs [6–8] reports on the management of COVID-19 in-patients with combination LPV/r or placebo did not show a beneficial effect on mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, the SOLIDARITY trial was stopped due to preliminary results showing that LPV/r produce no reduction in the mortality of COVID-19 hospitalized patients when compared to standard of care [9]. Second, ribavirin (RBV), a guanosine analogue and a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, has been evaluated in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and later had high half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 109.50 μM and selectivity index against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells [10].",a broad-spectrum antiviral drug,neutral,"

Can Echinacea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8879308/," Taking this into account, we conclude that preventive treatment with Echinacea provides beneficial effects to coronavirus infections in both, adults and children. In adults, infections could be prevented, whereas children demonstrated significantly reduced virus loads, symptom reduction, as well as shortened duration of illnesses. In both cases, preventive effects of Echinacea against coronaviruses could be ascertained in controlled clinical settings.Neither of the referenced studies detected the newly occurring SARS-CoV-2, but only endemic coronavirus strains, as both were carried out prior to 2019. Conclusions pertaining to COVID-19 must be carefully considered, but are nevertheless important, since many people rely on immune support by herbal preparations these days, and it is important to give an estimation on evidence.All coronaviruses share structural similarities, including an enveloped membrane containing the genetic material, i.e., RNA and spike proteins for attachment to target cells. Echinacea broadly inhibits enveloped respiratory viruses at physiological concentrations in vitro and in vivo; however, the exact mode-of-action remains to be elucidated. Due to this broad range of activity, deactivation of all measured coronavirus types, such as alpha (CoV-229E) and beta strains (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2) by Echinacea, can realistically be assumed, and the results of this study point towards the clinical relevance of in vitro findings.","In adults, infections could be prevented",neutral,"

Additional options are urgently needed to effectively attenuate non-severe infections and naso-oropharyngeal virus concentrations in order to further contain viral dissemination (Goldberg et al., 2021). This applies in particular to variants with a proven higher peak virus load and transmissibility even in fully vaccinated individuals, i.e., the Delta or Omicron variants (Pouwels et al., 2021; Migueres et al., 2022).Broad antiviral effects, including virucidal activity against coronaviruses (CoV) were attributed to the medicinal plant Echinacea (Pleschka et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2009; Signer et al., 2020). In vitro, a hydroethanolic extract prepared from freshly-harvested herb and root parts of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce®, EF) inhibited infectivity of human CoV-229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoV, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 (Signer et al., 2020). Two earlier prevention studies in adults and children suggested clinically relevant benefits of EF for enveloped viral pathogens including coronaviruses (Nicolussi et al., 2022).

AbstractIntroduction SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is effective in preventing severe COVID-19, but efficacy in reducing viral load and transmission wanes over time. In addition, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS-CoV-2 infections.Methods 120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 18 – 75 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention.",Echinacea purpurea,no,"

Can Echinacea prevent COVID-19?,https://www.herbalgram.org/resources/herbclip/issues/issue-666/ginger-and-echinacea-covid-19/," Echinacea (Echinacea spp., Asteraceae) aerial parts have been traditionally used in North American for cough, colds, bronchitis, upper respiratory system infection, inflammatory conditions and known to stimulate the immune system. Antiviral activity has been reported for echinacea preparations, but results are contradictory. Ginger and echinacea have both been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokine production, potentially reducing risks of the ""cytokine storms"" or dysregulation accompanying severe COVID-19. The authors conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) on the effects of ginger and echinacea in hospitalization rates and symptoms of patients suspected of having COVID-19. The RCT was conducted with outpatients in an urban health center (Saveh University of Medical Sciences; Saveh, Markazi, Iran [IR]) in April–June 2020. Suspicion was based on positive chest X-ray/CT scan and presenting symptoms consistent with COVID-19.",Ginger and echinacea have both been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokine production,neutral,"

Understanding Turmeric & Echinacea COVID-19 Warnings
Some experts are now warning that several natural medicines, includingÂ turmeric,Â echinacea,Â licorice, and others might interfere with the bodyâs immune and inflammatory response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Make sure patients understand these warnings. Turmeric, echinacea, and licorice have anti-inflammatory properties similar to NSAIDs. Several months ago, Franceâs health minister claimed that taking NSAIDs might increase the risk of severe COVID-19. But currently there isnât any strong evidence supporting this claim â experts still believe that NSAIDs can be considered for use in patients with COVID-19, just as they would be for any other fever or infection. This new warning about natural medicines is also coming out of France, for similar reasons to the NSAIDs warning.",COVID-19,neutral,"

Echinacea purpurea flowers. (Photo by Prof. Wim Vanden Berghe). Two years after the first emergence of SARS-CoV-2, various new waves of COVID-19 have swept across Europe. This has been driven by new variants due to the lifting of restrictions and increased social mixing, which will likely further increase in the autumn and winter months as schools reopen and people return from vacation. This could again place a huge burden on healthcare systems throughout the world, which are already under enormous pressure from dealing with the previous COVID-19 waves.

In this latest study led by Swiss researchers from iC-Cure Scientific-Switzerland along with scientists from  University of Graz-Austria, Universitätsmedizin Berlin-Germany, Italian Ministry of Defence and the Pediatric Clinic-Switzerland, that involved a detailed review and meta-analysis of data from past randomized clinical trials involving the usage of Echinacea, it was found that Echinacea was effective in both preventing and also treating a variety of Coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV-2. The study review presents the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two main RCTs capturing incidence of viral respiratory tract infections during Echinacea preventative treatment were identified including coronavirus infections. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. In the first study, collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N = 755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections (229E; HKU1; OC43) with Echinaforce® extract (2400 mg daily) and placebo, respectively (p = 0.0114).",effective in both preventing and also treating a variety of Coronavirus infections,neutral,"

Some studies have shown that the herb can make you feel better faster. Others suggest that echinacea has no impact on a cold at all. Several clinical trials have shown that people who take echinacea as soon as they feel sick reduce the severity of their cold and have fewer symptoms than those who do not take the herb. One study of 95 people with early symptoms of cold and flu (such as runny nose, scratchy throat, and fever) found that those who drank several cups of echinacea tea every day for 5 days felt better sooner than those who drank tea without echinacea.A review of 14 clinical trials found that echinacea reduced the odds of developing a cold by 58% and the duration of a cold by 1 to 4 days.

Q: Can drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water kill the coronavirus? A: The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you’ll raise your body’s pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that’s used to rank the acidity of substances.) Advertising Policy

Since then, the coronavirus has evolved into a global pandemic, and the wave of disinformation has grown.One such method of misinformation is the copy-and-paste of posts from anonymous or misidentified experts. An example of this is a false claim suggesting a 'cure' for SARS-COV-2 was found in Israel.What is the claim?The post, which we have found not only in English, but also in Spanish and Russian, begins by saying that there are ""no cases"" of coronavirus in Israel.This in itself is untrue, with Israel reporting more than 5,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of 1 April.It then suggests mixing lemon and baking soda with hot tea to ""immediately kill"" the virus, adding that this ""alkalizes the immune system"".The false claimThere are also numerous variations of this post. One such post found on Facebook calls on people to ""have your daily dose of lemon water, or add baking powder instead"" because the virus is ""pH sensitive"".Why is this false?We reached out to numerous virologists for their comment.Professor Michael Kann, professor of clinical virology at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, pointed to a study released earlier this year.

Most cases are mild and self-limiting, and treated symptomatically”, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters.The full claim reads:“Due to the rising issue of coronavirus it’s been found that coronavirus mutates & multiplies in the body through acid cells, in simple form, if you have too much acid cells in your body you are more likely to be infected by coronavirus & if you have less acid cells you stand less chance of being infected, & we know that bicarbonate of soda reduces acid cells in the body, so in order to clear yourself of acid cells, drink a small amount of the mixture of water & bicarbonate of soda, just take 1 or even half spoon of it & pour it into your water dispenser or drinking bottle just to keep your acid cells at a minimum level.",Reuters could not find any evidence,neutral,"

While at present there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it may be possible that people can become infected by touching a surface or object contaminated by the virus and then touching their face. The higher risk though, comes from being in close contact with other people while food shopping or receiving a food delivery. As always, good hygiene is important when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses. Remove any unnecessary packaging and dispose into a waste bin with a lid. Packaging like cans can be wiped clean with a disinfectant before being opened or stored. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand rub, immediately afterwards.",Wash your hands with soap and water,neutral,"
